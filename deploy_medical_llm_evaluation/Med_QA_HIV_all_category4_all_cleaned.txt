Hot packs and Tylenol seem to alleviate the pain somewhat. He denies lower extremity weakness, loss of sensation, fever, incontinence, or prior cancers; however, he reveals that his cousin was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Physical examination demonstrates normal range of motion and diffuse tenderness at the L4/L5 region with no point tenderness or vertebral step-offs.

A 27-year-old G2P2002 is recovering in the hospital on postpartum day 3 after a low transverse C-section. During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient’s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus’s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 119/82 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 14/min. Her incision looks clean and dry, there is mild suprapubic tenderness, and a foul yellow discharge tinged with blood is seen on her pad.

A 34-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 28 weeks of gestation presents to the physician for a prenatal visit. She has not had regular prenatal care. Her most recent abdominal ultrasound was at 20 weeks of gestation, and it confirmed accurate fetal dates and appropriate fetal development. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She used to work as a nurse before she emigrated from Brazil 13 years ago. She lost her immunization records during the move and cannot recall all of her vaccinations. She appears well. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination reveals a fundal height of 26 cm. No abnormalities are found during the physical exam. An ELISA test conducted for HIV is negative. Serology test results for hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis C antibody are positive for both. The laboratory test results for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis A antibody are negative. The polymerase chain reaction analysis of hepatitis C RNA is positive for genotype 1. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?

A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of fatigue, non-productive cough, and worsening shortness of breath while walking. She was diagnosed with HIV 11 years ago. Two years ago, she was treated for esophageal thrush with fluconazole. She takes no medications because she does not feel like she needs them.

A 51-year-old inmate was released from prison 1 month ago and visits his general practitioner for evaluation of a positive HIV diagnosis he received from a local free clinic a week ago. The patient states that he had spent the last 2 years in prison and that, during that time, he had engaged in multiple unprotected sexual acts with fellow male inmates. When he was released from prison recently, he decided to get tested for HIV and was diagnosed positive. He is currently married with 2 children and has been paroled back to the home he shares with them. He has not told either his wife or his children of his diagnosis. He adamantly states that he is not homosexual, but that his wife would assume that he is if she found out he had contracted HIV while in prison. He states that he is terrified his wife will leave him or possibly keep his children from seeing him if she finds out about his HIV status.  He wants to be treated without the threat of his wife finding out. He insists that he will use the proper precautions to ensure his wife and children don’t contract HIV from him and reiterates the importance of keeping his diagnosis a secret. He continues and states that “they are all I have. If they leave me, I have no one.” Which of the following is the most appropriate response in this patient’s case?
answer:E
