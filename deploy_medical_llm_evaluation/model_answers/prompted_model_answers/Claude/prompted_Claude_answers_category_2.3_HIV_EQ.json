Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

PCNSL is strongly associated with EBV infection in HIV patients\n\nThis AIDS-defining malignancy typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients (CD4 <100) and requires brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis, though the combination of EBV-positive CSF and characteristic imaging is highly suggestive.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum.

It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thus blocking the conformational changes required for viral fusion with the cell membrane. However, it's important to note that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its need for twice-daily subcutaneous injections and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with multidrug resistance.\n    Target answer: The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters.

Its mechanism of action involves:\n\n1. Trimethoprim: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\n2. Sulfamethoxazole: Competes with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase\n\nTogether, these agents provide a sequential blockade of folate metabolism, which is essential for bacterial DNA synthesis. This dual mechanism makes TMP-SMX particularly effective against Nocardia and other susceptible organisms.\n    Target answer: The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process.

Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease.

Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and less commonly other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), can cause pancreatitis as a side effect.\n\n2. The patient has a relatively recent HIV diagnosis (6 months) and is on ART, though she can't recall the specific medications.\n\n3. Other common causes seem less likely:\n- No gallstones visible on CT\n- BMI is normal (21 kg/m2), making metabolic causes less likely\n- Only moderate alcohol use reported (not heavy drinking)\n- Triglycerides weren't mentioned as being elevated\n\nThe next steps would be to:\n1. Review her current ART regimen\n2. Consider temporarily holding suspected causative medications\n3. Consider alternative ART regimens if medication-induced pancreatitis is confirmed\n\nWould recommend checking triglycerides and other metabolic parameters to rule out other potential causes as well.\n    Target answer: It is most likely related to their HIV medication.\n    Background Question: A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2.

It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing HIV from converting its RNA genome into DNA. This disrupts HIV's ability to integrate into the host cell's genome and replicate.\n\nIn this urgent intrapartum scenario, IV zidovudine is used as prophylaxis to reduce mother-to-child transmission, even though it's not as effective as full combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy would have been.\n    Target answer:  Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n    Background Question:  A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor.
