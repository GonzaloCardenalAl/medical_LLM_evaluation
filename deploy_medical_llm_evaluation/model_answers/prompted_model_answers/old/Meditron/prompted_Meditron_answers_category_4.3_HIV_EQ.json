The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test? If you are seeing a patient in clinic who has a negative result from this test, what is the likelihood this patient has AIDS?\n## NPV Calculation\nThe NPV is a measure of the frequency of the disease within the total number of test negatives. It is defined by the following:\n\\[\\text{NPV}=\\frac{\\text{Disease - true negatives}}{\\text{Disease - true negatives}}\\] \\[+\\text{No disease - false negatives}\\]\nUsing the data from the problem, we can calculate the NPV:\n\\[\\text{NPV}=\\frac{10}{10+5}\\times 100\\%=67\\%\\]\nThus, the likelihood of a patient with a negative screening test result who actually has AIDS is 67%.\n## Answer:\nC. There is a 67% probability that a patient who tested negative for this test actually has AIDS.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?A. Primary CNS lymphomaB. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)C. Cryptococcal meningitisD. HIV encephalitisE. Toxoplasma encephalitisF. Stroke\n### Answer:\nB. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\n### Explanation:\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection of the brain caused by the JC virus, a polyomavirus that is reactivated in the setting of a compromised immune system, most commonly in individuals with AIDS. In patients with AIDS, PML typically occurs when the CD4+ count falls below 200/\u03bcL. Clinical features include progressive focal neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, cognitive dysfunction, and ataxia. PML often results in progressive dementia that occurs over weeks to months, leading to death. On MRI, PML is characterized by disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions that are associated with little to no mass effect. The lesions typically appear T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense.\n\nAIDS-defining illnesses and typical CD4+ count\n\n### Primary CNS lymphoma\nAIDS patients with lymphoma of the CNS are typically diagnosed at a CD4+ count below 50/\u03bcL, which is lower than the CD4+ count in the patient in the vignette. On MRI, CNS lymphoma presents with ring-enhancing lesions and significant mass effect. On imaging, CNS lymphoma typically appears hypodense on CT and T2-hyperintense on MRI. A definitive diagnosis is made through tissue biopsy. HIV encephalitis and PML can be distinguished from CNS lymphoma through the lack of mass effect and enhancement.\n\n### Cryptococcal meningitis\nCryptococcal meningitis is the most common fungal infection of the brain in patients with AIDS. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, and a change in mental status. Cryptococcal meningitis usually occurs in patients with a CD4+ count below 50/\u03bcL, which is lower than the CD4+ count in the patient in the vignette. In the early stage, CT and MRI scans are often normal, but as the disease progresses, hydrocephalus can occur. Cryptococcal meningitis is typically diagnosed via lumbar puncture with elevated opening pressure and lymphocytic pleocytosis. The cryptococcal antigen test may be used as a diagnostic\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls.

[/fig]\n[fig] Figure 1: 1: White patch on the palate in a patient with oral candidiasis. 2: A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status, tremors, and vomiting for the past 12 hours. He was in his normal state of health until 24 hours ago. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He takes insulin glargine, insulin aspart, and lisinopril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He drinks 3 liters of wine weekly and denies the use of illicit drugs. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The BMI is 28 kg/m2. He has a mild hand tremor and appears lethargic. He responds appropriately when asked questions. A fingerstick glucose measurement is 35 mg/dL. Serum levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and liver function tests are normal. A chest x-ray shows no infiltrate. Urinalysis shows 4+ glucose and 4+ ketones. Treatment with thiamine and intravenous glucose is begun. Within 3 hours, the patient's blood glucose concentration is 130 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas (ABG) sample shows the following: pH 7.44; pCO2 34 mm Hg; bicarbonate 22 mEq/L; oxygen saturation 98% on room air; base excess +0.4. Two hours later, he is no longer lethargic.

Chronic thiamine deficiency C. Chronic excessive cocaine use D. Chronic excessive tobacco use E. Chronic excessive marijuana use Answer: A [/fig]\n[fig] Answer: C Explanation: This patient has an alcohol use disorder and a history of binge drinking that caused hypoglycemia due to thiamine deficiency (wernicke encephalopathy). He likely has a chronic deficiency of thiamine, although this can also be caused by a sudden drop in his blood glucose level. The high ethanol levels from binge drinking inhibited gluconeogenesis and caused a sudden drop in his blood glucose. Binge drinking can also cause alcohol withdrawal symptoms and seizures.

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? \n\n### Adverse Effects of Indinavir\n\n#### Overview\nIndinavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is most commonly used in combination with other medications, such as lamivudine and zidovudine, to prevent the progression of the disease.\n\n#### Adverse Effects\nThe use of indinavir is associated with several adverse effects, including:\n\n#### 1. **Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones)**\n- **Definition:** Nephrolithiasis is a condition characterized by the formation of kidney stones.\n- **Mechanism:** Indinavir is known to increase the risk of nephrolithiasis due to its tendency to crystallize in the urine.\n- **Risk Factors:** Patients taking indinavir are at an increased risk of developing kidney stones, which can cause severe pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n#### 2. **Gastrointestinal Toxicity**\n- **Definition:** Gastrointestinal toxicity refers to adverse effects on the digestive system, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n- **Mechanism:** Indinavir can cause gastrointestinal toxicity due to its potential to disrupt the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n#### 3. **Other Adverse Effects**\n- **Lipodystrophy:** Indinavir can cause lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by abnormal fat distribution in the body.\n- **Hemolytic Anemia:** Rarely, indinavir can cause hemolytic anemia, a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made.\n- **Increased Serum Bilirubin:** Indinavir can cause an increase in serum bilirubin levels, which can lead to jaundice.\n- **Hyperglycemia:** Indinavir can cause an increase in blood sugar levels, which can be a concern for patients with diabetes.\n\n### Answer:\nNephrolithiasis\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night.
