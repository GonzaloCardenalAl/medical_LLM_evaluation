(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test? What is the PPV?\n### Defining the Numbers\n- True positives: A total of 240 patients are known to have the disease and tested positive on the screening examination.\n- False negatives: A total of 10 patients are known to have the disease and tested negative on the screening examination.\n- False positives: A total of 5 patients are known not to have the disease and tested positive on the screening examination.\n- True negatives: A total of 245 patients are known not to have the disease and tested negative on the screening examination.\n### Calculating the NPV\n- NPV = true negatives/(false positives + true negatives) = 245/(5 + 245) = 245/250 = 0.98\n### Calculating the PPV\n- PPV = true positives/(true positives + false positives) = 240/(240 + 5) = 240/245 = 0.98\n### Answer:\nThe NPV and PPV for the novel screening test are both 98%.\n\n## Review Questions\n### Question 1\nWhich of the following best describes the effect of a change in the prevalence of a disease on a screening test\u2019s positive predictive value (PPV)?\n### Answer:\nD. A decrease in the prevalence of a disease will decrease the PPV.\n### Explanation\nA decrease in the prevalence of a disease will decrease the PPV. A decrease in prevalence increases the chance of false-positive test results, thereby decreasing the PPV. The negative predictive value (NPV) is inversely affected by the prevalence of a disease.\n### Question 2\nWhat is the likelihood that a patient who tested positive on a screening test truly has the disease?\n### Answer:\nB. Positive predictive value\n### Explanation\nThe positive predictive value of a test describes the likelihood that a patient who tested positive truly has the disease. The negative predictive value describes the likelihood that a patient who tested negative does not have the disease.\n### Question 3\nHow is sensitivity defined?\n### Answer:\nD. The proportion of people who have the disease and test positive\n### Explanation\nSensitivity is defined as the proportion of people who have the disease and test positive. The sensitivity of a test is a measure of its ability to identify the people with the disease. Specificity, another important test characteristic, is defined as the proportion of people who do not have the disease and test negative.\n### Question 4\nWhich of the following best describes the negative predictive value (NPV)?\n### Answer:\nB.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathyC. HIV encephalopathyD. NeurocysticercosisE. Cerebral toxoplasmosis\n**Pathophysiology of AIDS Dementia**\n\nAIDS dementia complex (ADC), also known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), is a neurological disorder that affects individuals with HIV/AIDS. It is a common complication of the disease and is often the first symptom of HIV infection. ADC is characterized by a range of cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms.\n\n**Clinical Features of ADC**\n\nThe clinical features of ADC can vary, but they typically include:\n\n- **Cognitive Impairment**: Memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and difficulty with concentration and attention.\n- **Motor Symptoms**: Weakness, tremors, ataxia, and loss of coordination.\n- **Behavioral Symptoms**: Depression, anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations.\n\n**Imaging Features of ADC**\n\nThe MRI findings in ADC are characteristic and can help in making a diagnosis. The typical findings include:\n\n- **Disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions**: These lesions are scattered throughout the brain and are not accompanied by a mass effect.\n- **No enhancement**: The lesions do not show enhancement on MRI, which is a characteristic feature of ADC.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**\n\nThe differential diagnosis of ADC includes other neurological disorders that can affect individuals with HIV/AIDS. These include:\n\n- **Cryptococcal meningitis**: A fungal infection that causes meningitis and can lead to neurological symptoms.\n- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: A rare viral infection that causes demyelination of the white matter.\n- **Neurocysticercosis**: A parasitic infection that causes cysts in the brain.\n- **Cerebral toxoplasmosis**: A parasitic infection that causes lesions in the brain.\n\n**Reference:** Various medical literature and textbooks\n\n### Answer:\nC.

What is the most likely diagnosis? \nToxoplasmosis\n\nToxoplasmosis is a disease caused by infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite found in the gastrointestinal tract of cats. Humans can become infected through exposure to infected cat feces or consumption of infected meat. If the patient has a normal immune system, the infection can be cleared and does not lead to disease; however, the parasite may stay latent for the rest of the patient's life. Patients with immunodeficiency such as HIV patients with advanced AIDS may be reactivated.\n\nPatients typically present with headache, fever, and changes in their behavior or personality. Imaging of the brain shows ring-enhancing lesions, and serology shows elevated IgG levels.\n\n### Answer:\nToxoplasmosis\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks.
