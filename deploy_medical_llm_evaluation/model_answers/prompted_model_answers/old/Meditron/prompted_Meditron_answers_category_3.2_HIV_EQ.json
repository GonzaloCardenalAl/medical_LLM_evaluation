After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein? \n### Retroviral Envelope Glycoprotein Structure\n\nHIV, a member of the retrovirus family, consists of two identical single-stranded RNA strands. The viral capsid (protein coat) is covered by an outer lipid membrane containing viral glycoproteins, which are used to bind and enter host cells. The two main glycoproteins that compose the HIV envelope are gp120 and gp41.\n\n- **gp120**:\n  - An outer glycoprotein that binds to the CD4 molecule on the surface of host immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes).\n  - Following binding of gp120 to the CD4 molecule, the host cell undergoes conformational changes that allow gp120 to bind to a co-receptor (typically CCR5 or CXCR4) on the host cell.\n  - After binding, gp120 undergoes further conformational changes, which then enable gp41 to enter the host cell membrane and initiate fusion.\n\n- **gp41**:\n  - An outer glycoprotein that spans the viral envelope and is anchored into the viral lipid bilayer.\n  - It consists of a fusion domain (also known as a fusion peptide) that is able to insert into the host cell membrane, and a heptad repeat (HR) domain that can bind to itself in an antiparallel manner, forming a hairpin structure.\n\n### Mechanism of Fusion\n\nFollowing gp120 binding to the CD4 and co-receptor molecules, gp120 undergoes conformational changes that expose gp41 in its native (prefusion) state. The gp41 fusion domain inserts into the host cell membrane, and the gp41 HR domains bind to each other to form a hairpin structure. As the gp41 molecules come together, they bring the viral and host membranes together, leading to the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. As fusion occurs, the viral capsid and genetic material enter the host cell, where they can then replicate.\n\n### Treatment of HIV\n\nThe patient has HIV and therefore requires treatment to reduce viral load. The patient's high-risk lifestyle puts him at risk for recurrent HIV infection, so the physician prescribes post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication that reduces the risk of contracting HIV after exposure. This medication contains enfruvitide, which acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein.\n\n### Answer:\nEnfruvitide is an HIV fusion inhibitor that targets gp41. It binds to the\n    Target answer: The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters.

The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed? \n### Explanation\nThe mother could not be breastfeeding the child. Formula would be heated to pasteurize the product. However, if the product was overheated or left to cool for a long time, some vitamins may be destroyed. Vitamin C is known to be the most heat labile of the vitamins. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) acts as a coenzyme for a number of different enzymes involved in various biosynthetic reactions. One of the reactions it participates in is the hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen. In addition, it serves as a coenzyme in hydroxylation reactions during catecholamine synthesis, bile acid biosynthesis, and amidation reactions of the C-terminal of neuropeptides. It is the ability of ascorbic acid to participate in hydroxylation reactions that allows for its role as a cofactor for the enzymes prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, necessary in collagen synthesis. In order for these enzymes to act, vitamin C is required for their activity. This function is critical since without it, collagen synthesis is diminished, and this is seen in scurvy.\nAnswer: B\n    Target answer: If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired.\n    Background Question: A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago.

She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment? Zidovudine and didanosine\n### Risk Factors for Acute Pancreatitis\n\n The most common risk factors for acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol abuse. The incidence of acute pancreatitis in the United States has increased in recent years, mostly due to the increase in alcohol abuse. Gallstones cause 30% to 60% of acute pancreatitis cases and alcohol abuse causes 15% to 30%. Other less common risk factors include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, trauma, ERCP, drug-induced pancreatitis, infections, and tumors.\n\n### Clinical Features of Acute Pancreatitis\n\n Acute pancreatitis is characterized by acute upper abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. The pain usually radiates to the back and typically persists. Most patients have a fever. Serum amylase and lipase levels are elevated.\n\n### Complications of Acute Pancreatitis\n\n Complications of acute pancreatitis include:\n\n - **Pseudocyst**: A cystic fluid collection that arises from pancreatic duct injury and usually develops several weeks after acute pancreatitis. It is lined by granulation tissue (not epithelium) and may be complicated by infection and hemorrhage. It resolves in some patients spontaneously, but can require endoscopic or surgical intervention if complications develop.\n - **Necrotizing pancreatitis**: Necrotizing pancreatitis may be complicated by infection and hemorrhage. It can result in the formation of walled-off necrosis that may require drainage and debridement.\n - **Systemic complications**: Severe acute pancreatitis is complicated by hypovolemia, hypotension, ARDS, and renal and cardiac failure.\n\n### Treatment of Acute Pancreatitis\n\n The management of acute pancreatitis includes:\n\n - **Pain control**: Administering analgesia is essential to control pain and provide comfort to the patient.\n - **Supportive care**: Providing supportive care is crucial in acute pancreatitis. It includes IV hydration, electrolyte and nutritional support, and, in severe pancreatitis, monitoring for respiratory failure, hypotension, and renal failure.\n - **ERCP and sphincterotomy**: In cases of gallstone pancreatitis, ERCP and sphincterotomy are performed to extract impacted gallstones.\n - **Debridement and drainage**: In cases of necrotizing pancreatitis, surgical debridement and percutaneous or endoscopic drainage of necrotic tissue and fluid collections may be required.\n\n### Answer:\nZidovudine and didanos\n    Target answer: After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit.

Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?Valganciclovir is a prodrug that is rapidly converted in the body to ganciclovir. Ganciclovir is a guanine nucleoside analogue. It inhibits viral DNA polymerase in cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus. This agent causes a reversible myelosuppression, which can be potentiated when used in combination with zidovudine, a thymidine nucleoside analogue. Ganciclovir and zidovudine have a synergistic toxicity when given together. The mechanism is unknown but is thought to involve decreased intracellular levels of thymidine and thymidine triphosphate in bone marrow cells, leading to a decrease in hematopoietic precursors. The combination should be avoided, and hematologic indices should be monitored closely if it is necessary. Other adverse effects of ganciclovir include peripheral neuropathy, retinal detachment, seizures, and dermatologic reactions.\n\nThis question requires the test-taker to evaluate the consequences of using the combination of two drugs together, one of which is a new treatment (valganciclovir) for a new condition (CMV colitis) in a patient with HIV.

Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern? \nExplanation:\nAfter birth, the HIV antibody test is positive in both infected and uninfected babies due to maternal antibodies. An HIV DNA PCR test will reveal the baby\u2019s HIV status.\nAntibody tests (immunofluorescent antibody [IFA], enzyme immunoassay [EIA]) are not useful for detection of HIV in infants because of passive transfer of maternal antibodies.\nA Western blot test is useful in adults to confirm the presence of HIV antibodies but is not useful in babies to determine HIV status.\nThe viral culture method can be used to detect HIV in infants but is time consuming, expensive, and not widely available.\nThe HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method can be used to detect HIV in infants and is the preferred method because of its speed and high specificity.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA.\n    Background Question: A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care.

The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?A patient with HIV may initially present with flu-like symptoms, aseptic meningitis, fever, sore throat, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, or a viral syndrome. The patient may have a positive blood test for HIV antibody and/or antigen, confirming the diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Prevention recommends routine testing for HIV for all patients, ages 13 to 64 years, in health care settings. Patient consent for HIV testing should be incorporated into the general consent for medical care. The decision to not be tested for HIV should be respected; however, patients should be encouraged to accept HIV testing. If the patient is at high risk of HIV infection or has a known or possible exposure to HIV within the past 6 months, the patient should be asked to consent to HIV testing. The CDC also recommends that patients at high risk for HIV infection should be tested at least annually. All pregnant women should be tested for HIV. If an individual's HIV test result is positive, the patient must be informed of his/her test results in a private and supportive environment and counseled about HIV disease, treatment, and the importance of notifying his/her partner(s). Partner notification must be done in a confidential manner by a public health authority or health care provider. Individuals with HIV should be told about the importance of informing their partner(s) about their diagnosis. The patient should also be provided with information on how to reduce high-risk behaviors and reduce transmission to others. If the partner cannot be identified or contacted, anonymous notification can be attempted. In the case presented above, the physician should counsel the patient and emphasize the importance of telling his wife. It is also important that the patient should be tested and treated for other sexually transmitted infections.\n    Target answer: The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination.

When stained with India ink, light microscopy of the patient\u2019s CSF reveals encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds. Assuming a single pathogenic organism is responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms, what diagnostic test results would also be expected in this patient? \n### ANSWER:\n1. Positive serum cryptococcal antigen\n\nCryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the most common opportunistic infections in AIDS patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm\u00b3. 1 Patients can be asymptomatic for long periods of time, but if untreated, the disease is uniformly fatal. Patients typically present with fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity. Other symptoms, such as confusion, lethargy, and focal neurologic symptoms may occur, and their presence portends a poor prognosis. 1\n\nIn AIDS patients, the opening pressure at lumbar puncture is often increased, and routine analysis of CSF typically shows a mononuclear pleocytosis, with decreased CSF glucose and elevated CSF protein. However, AIDS patients may have a lymphocyte predominance or normal CSF cell counts. India ink staining is useful in diagnosing CM, but it has limited sensitivity. Diagnosis can be made by culture and/or positive CSF cryptococcal antigen, which is a highly sensitive and specific test. If initial lumbar puncture is negative, repeat lumbar punctures can be helpful. In addition, if the patient is suspected of having cryptococcal meningitis but has negative CSF results, biopsy of extrapulmonary or meningeal tissues can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. 2 In patients with AIDS and disseminated cryptococcosis, blood cultures are often positive. \n### REFERENCE:\n1.
