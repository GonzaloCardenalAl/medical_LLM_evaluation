Which drugs are most frequently co-administered? What is the drug market share per class and total? A poster presented today at CROI 2012 by the Swiss HIV Cohort Study has answers to these questions. Based on prescriptions dispensed in 2010, 15'000 antiretroviral treatment regimens in the SHCS were evaluated for the purpose of the analysis.\nThe most frequently prescribed drugs in 2010 were tenofovir (49%), abacavir (28%), efavirenz (26%), emtricitabine (26%), and lamivudine (23%). There was a significant increase of 23% in tenofovir prescriptions compared to 2007. The 3 most frequently co-administered drugs in 2010 were emtricitabine and tenofovir (31%), efavirenz and tenofovir (21%), and emtricitabine and abacavir (18%). The drug market share per class was 36% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 30% for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 22% for protease inhibitors (PIs), and 11% for integrase inhibitors (INIs). The share of PIs and INIs for patients who had received a second line regimen was 40% and 17%, respectively, while the share of PIs was significantly lower (16%) and the share of INIs higher (22%) for patients who received a third line regimen.\nThe study also compared prescriptions of first and third line treatment regimens in 2008 and 2010.  The market share for NRTIs and INIs increased significantly (43% to 46% and 8% to 16%, respectively), while the shares for NNRTIs and PIs decreased (32% to 28% and 17% to 10%, respectively) between 2008 and 2010. For third line regimens, the market share for NRTIs decreased significantly (37% to 30%) and the share for INIs increased significantly (13% to 22%).

A national cohort study\n\nBackground: Mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of HIV was greatly reduced in Switzerland since the introduction of prophylaxis and the offer of elective cesarean section to all HIV-infected women. However, due to these preventive measures, only few MTCT occur nowadays. As a consequence, the number of children born to HIV-infected women has increased substantially. A national cohort study was designed to investigate birth trends among HIV-infected women in Switzerland in 2010. Methods: Using the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss National Cohort (SNC), a retrospective cohort study was designed to investigate the birth rate among HIV-infected women aged 15-49 years in Switzerland in 2010. The prevalence of HIV among women of reproductive age in Switzerland in 2010 was 0.07%. 56.8% of these women were of reproductive age. A total of 41 women reported at least one pregnancy in 2010. Of these, 31 women gave birth to a total of 34 newborns. Results: HIV prevalence among women of reproductive age was estimated at 0.07% (95% CI 0.06-0.08). Of the women of reproductive age, 20.9% reported at least one previous pregnancy and 0.8% reported at least one pregnancy in 2010. The estimated birth rate among all women of reproductive age was 10.3% (95% CI 9.7-11.0), and 8.6% (95% CI 4.6-14.9) among HIV-infected women. Conclusion: This retrospective study showed that the birth rate among HIV-infected women of reproductive age in Switzerland was as high as that of the general population.\n\n# Background\nHIV infection has changed from an acute and mostly fatal disease in the early stages of the epidemic to a chronic condition, especially in Western countries with easy access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and high adherence rates to treatment [bib_ref] A call to action for comprehensive HIV services for women and girls, Curran [/bib_ref].

A population-based study\n\nObjective: To examine the overall birth rates (OBR) and OBR ratio of Swiss women with and without HIV between 1997 and 2020. Methods: A population-based cohort study of Swiss women with and without HIV, aged 15-45 years, from 1997 to 2020. Data on women with HIV was extracted from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) registry, and data on the general population from the Federal Statistical Office. OBRs were defined as the annual number of live births divided by the female population of childbearing age in the respective year. OBR ratios were calculated by dividing OBR of women with HIV by the OBR of the general population in a given year. Linear regression was used to assess changes in OBRs over time. Results: There were 6,142 pregnancies in 3,051 women with HIV and 2,024,857 live births in the general population between 1997 and 2020. The OBR of women with HIV decreased from 10.5 in 1997 to 6.8 in 2020, compared to 8.8 and 5.8 in the general population, respectively (p <.001). The OBR ratio decreased from 1.19 in 1997 to 1.18 in 2020 (p =.01). Conclusion: The OBR of women with HIV in Switzerland is 1.2 times higher than that of the general population. Women with HIV should be counselled to take advantage of highly effective antiretroviral therapies.\n\n## 1.\nIntroduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, with 1.5 million new infections in 2020. More than half of people living with HIV (PLWH) are of reproductive age. The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy of PLWH substantially, and childbearing has become an option for many women living with HIV (WLWH). To prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, women are advised to initiate and continue ART. Nevertheless, motherhood among PLWH is not without challenges and many have reported barriers to reproduction, including limited access to reproductive care, limited knowledge about the risks and benefits of pregnancy, fear of adverse outcomes, lack of family and social support, financial concerns, and fear of HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. On the other hand, the prevalence of HIV among pregnant women varies globally and depends on the region,\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Objectives: This study aims to assess self-reported treatment adherence and to determine associated factors in the Swiss population.\n\n# Introduction\nMedicines have an essential role in the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, the prevention of disease progression and the improvement of quality of life. However, in 2014, the WHO noted that only half of people with chronic illnesses take their medicines as prescribed and that poor adherence to treatment may lead to poorer health outcomes and higher healthcare costs.\nIn Switzerland, a number of studies have demonstrated that non-adherence to treatment leads to poor health outcomes and to an increase in healthcare expenditure. However, the situation in terms of self-reported treatment adherence in Switzerland remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to assess self-reported treatment adherence and to determine associated factors in the Swiss population.\n\n# Method\nThis study is part of the Health and Medicine Observatory (OBSAN), a continuing survey of the health and medical care of the population of Switzerland. It is based on 15,500 telephone interviews conducted in 2012. A representative sample of the population was generated by random digital dialling (RDD), and a random selection was used to determine the respondent within each household. Data were weighted to ensure that the sample reflected the known demographic characteristics of the Swiss population. Self-reported treatment adherence was measured using a binary response variable (adherence versus non-adherence). The dependent variable was created based on two questions relating to self-reported treatment adherence: \"Do you sometimes forget to take your medicine as prescribed?\"; and \"Did you sometimes stop taking your medicine as prescribed without consulting your doctor?\".\nAn individual was defined as being adherent to treatment if the respondent answered \"No\" to both questions. Conversely, an individual was defined as being non-adherent to treatment if the respondent answered \"Yes\" to one of the two questions. The data were analysed using a descriptive and multivariate approach. The latter consisted of multiple logistic regression. The analysis was performed with Stata SE 13.0, and statistical significance was set at 5%. The following independent variables were considered: sex, age, income, educational level, marital status, living alone, nationality, chronic condition, number of medicines taken, number of doctor visits in the past year and perceived state of health.\nFor statistical analyses, these variables were transformed into dichotomous or categorical variables, as follows: sex (men versus women); age (less than 40 years versus 40 to 64 years versus more than 65 years); income (less than CHF 400\n    Target answer: Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

These barriers often lead to worse health outcomes and even death.\n\n### Factors Contributing to Stigma and Discrimination\n\nThere are various factors that contribute to stigma and discrimination, including:\n\n- **Fear and Misconceptions about HIV Transmission**: People often fear getting HIV from PWH, even though the risk of transmission through casual contact is extremely low.\n- **Social Isolation**: Many PWH experience social isolation and feel like outcasts due to the stigma surrounding HIV.\n- **Healthcare Worker Attitudes**: Some healthcare workers may hold prejudiced attitudes towards PWH, which can affect the quality of care they receive.\n- **Disclosure**: PWH often fear disclosing their status to friends and family, which can lead to feelings of isolation and further stigma.\n\n### Statistics on Stigma and Discrimination\n\nAccording to recent statistics:\n\n- **Fear of Disclosure**: Only 32% of PWH are open to disclosure to friends, indicating that a significant majority are not comfortable sharing their status.\n- **Stigma as Outcasts**: As many as 44% of PWH consider themselves outcasts, highlighting the severe impact of stigma on their lives.\n- **Prejudiced Healthcare Worker Attitudes**: A significant proportion of healthcare workers may hold prejudiced attitudes towards PWH, which can affect the quality of care they receive.\n\n### Answer:\n\nB 44 percent\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

A national cohort study, Australia\n\nObjectives To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of people who died of HIV-related causes who were first diagnosed with HIV before age 20 (PHIV<20). Design Nationwide, longitudinal, observational, clinical cohort study. Setting Data were obtained from the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD). Participants People with HIV (PWH) enrolled in the AHOD who had their first positive HIV test in Australia between 1997 and 2015 and were aged \u226515 years at first diagnosis. Primary and secondary outcomes Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included demographic characteristics, HIV exposure risk, clinical characteristics, linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, antiretroviral regimen, HIV viral load (VL), CD4 count, AIDS diagnosis, coinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Results The study included 123 PWH with first positive HIV test before age 20 (PHIV<20) and 14 182 PWH with first positive HIV test at \u226520 years (PHIV\u226520). PHIV<20 were diagnosed younger (18.7 vs 40.4 years), had been diagnosed for a shorter duration (3.8 vs 8.5 years) and were more likely to be female (31.7% vs 9.5%) compared with PHIV\u226520 (all p<0.001). PHIV<20 were more likely to die of HIV-related causes compared with PHIV\u226520 (6.5% vs 3.8%; adjusted sub-HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.20). HIV-related deaths occurred sooner in the PHIV<20 group (2.2 vs 4.5 years) and 10 of 8 (80.0%) PHIV<20 had an AIDS diagnosis prior to death. In multivariable analysis, ART non-adherence, low CD4 count at baseline and virological failure were associated with a higher risk of death. Conclusion PHIV<20 have a higher risk of HIV-related mortality and a faster progression to AIDS compared with PHIV\u226520, and they are more likely to be women. These patients should be prioritised for enhanced monitoring and management, particularly in relation to treatment adherence.\n\n# Abstract\nObjectives To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of people who died of HIV-related causes who were first diagnosed with HIV before age 20 (\n    Target answer: Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20.\n    Background Question: What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

We conducted a systematic literature search of six databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), International AIDS Society Clinical Trial Database (clinicaltrials.gov), and Google Scholar. Two authors (LMA and CEA) independently screened the titles and abstracts and identified eligible full-text articles for data extraction. Eligible articles were observational studies reporting the mean time to develop AIDS for a cohort of PWH who tested HIV-positive for the first time at or after the age of 20. The outcome of interest was the time taken for a patient's CD4 count to fall below 200 following their first positive HIV test. The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42019119475). A total of 9,174 articles were retrieved from the databases. A total of 12 articles were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis showed that for PWH tested between 20 and 24 years of age, the time taken for the CD4 count to drop below 200 was 6.4 years longer (95% CI: 3.1, 9.8) compared to those who tested PLOS ONE\n[formula] a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 [/formula]\nIntroduction The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that 37.7 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2019. About 5.9 million people are living with HIV in the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America combined. An estimated 2.7 million adolescents and young people aged 10-24 years were living with HIV in 2019, of which 240,000 were newly infected in 2019. In 2019, adolescents accounted for 16% of new HIV infections, despite accounting for just 6% of the total population. Among adolescents and young people who were living with HIV, only 52% knew their HIV status. Many young people living with HIV do not receive HIV testing and/or linkage to care in a timely manner, leading to later-stage diagnosis of HIV infection, delayed treatment, and an increased risk of HIV transmission\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
