[2] (see 'Acute and early HIV infection' above):\n\n\u2022Signs and symptoms consistent with acute or early HIV infection (see 'Acute and early HIV infection' above)\n\n\u2022Risk factors for HIV acquisition (see \"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection\")\n\n\u2022A negative HIV antibody test within the prior six months in persons at high risk for infection\n\nA high level of suspicion for acute HIV is important because patients are more likely to transmit the virus during early infection [11,12], and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may improve clinical outcomes [10,13,14] (see 'Initiation of antiretroviral therapy' below). In a randomized controlled trial of 366 treatment-na\u00efve patients who were identified during early HIV infection (median 12 days from estimated date of infection), immediate ART (vs deferred therapy) led to faster rates of CD4 T-cell recovery, improved HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function, and lower levels of cell-associated HIV RNA in CD4 T cells [13]. These results suggest that immediate ART can lead to partial immune reconstitution.\n\nEarly HIV infection may be identified during screening for HIV or during evaluation for an acute viral illness. (See \"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection\".)\n\nDiagnostic evaluation\nWhen acute or early HIV infection is suspected, we perform simultaneous testing for both HIV antibodies and HIV plasma (viral load) RNA. If virologic testing is positive (ie, detectable HIV RNA), we subsequently perform HIV differentiator testing (if not already done) and a baseline genotype test for drug-resistance mutations. (See \"Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation\" and \"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection\", section on 'HIV diagnostic testing algorithm' and \"Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays\".)\n\nThe fourth generation antibody-antigen assay is the preferred diagnostic test in patients with suspected acute or early HIV infection since a positive test confirms that the patient has HIV infection. However, the sensitivity of the antibody-antigen test for early HIV infection is variable. A positive test indicates established infection; a negative test in the setting of a detectable plasma viral load by nucleic acid testing is indicative of acute HIV infection. (See \"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection\", section on 'Antibody-antigen assay'.)\n\nThe plasma HIV RNA level can vary from 10,000 to 1 million copies/mL early during the course of acute infection, but may be increasing\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

If left untreated, how long does it take before the patient enters each stage? How is HIV diagnosed?\n## HIV Diagnosis and Staging\n Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is made by testing the blood for antibodies to HIV. Testing for HIV is done using an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. A Western blot is used as a confirmatory test if a person tests positive on the ELISA. There are also rapid tests for HIV that give a result in 30 minutes or less and do not require a laboratory. HIV infection can be diagnosed in newborn babies by testing the blood for the virus (HIV DNA PCR), as the baby will carry the mother\u2019s antibodies for 3 to 12 months after birth.\n HIV infection is categorized into several stages, based on the amount of virus present in the blood and on the ability of the immune system to fight off infections.\n\n## Acute HIV Infection\n After HIV has entered the body, it has the ability to replicate itself within a few weeks. It can cause a flu-like illness known as primary or acute HIV infection. This illness can be accompanied by high fever, rash, sore throat, headaches, and body aches. Symptoms usually begin within 2 weeks to 6 months after exposure, with most people experiencing symptoms within the first month. At this point, there are high levels of the virus in the blood. Once the body has developed antibodies against the virus (seroconversion), the amount of virus in the blood decreases. Most people are not aware that they have HIV infection at this stage.\n\n## Stage 1: Chronic Asymptomatic HIV Infection\n The stage following primary HIV infection is known as chronic asymptomatic HIV infection. There are few or no symptoms during this stage, and there are usually only low levels of virus in the blood. The immune system is fighting the infection and is strong enough to prevent other infections from occurring. A normal CD4 lymphocyte count is between 500 and 1400 cells/microliter. This stage can last for many years and may never progress to the more serious stages.\n\n## Stage 2: Symptomatic HIV Infection\n During this stage, the immune system is weakened, the viral load is high, and other opportunistic infections or malignancies may occur. Symptoms of this stage include:\n - weight loss\n - fatigue\n - fever\n - sweats\n - lymphadenopathy\n - skin rashes\n - mouth sores\n - chronic diarrhea\n - recurrent\n    Target answer: The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

You can also get HIV by sharing a needle (such as a needle used to inject drugs) with someone who has HIV.\nWhat Is HIV And AIDS?\nHIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The acronym \"HIV\" stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is one of a group of viruses known as retroviruses.\nAIDS\nWhat is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the last stage of HIV infection. AIDS develops when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of HIV infection. The immune system, which normally protects the body from infection and disease, is weakened to the point that it has lost the ability to effectively defend the body.\n    Target answer: HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids.

A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews\n\nHIV is associated with a number of common comorbidities which can increase with age, with some HIVspecific (lipodystrophy, chronic diarrhoea) and others similar to those seen in the general population. We aimed to estimate prevalence of comorbidities among people living with HIV (PLWH) compared with the general population. We systematically reviewed existing systematic reviews reporting prevalence of comorbidities (non-AIDS-defining malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, renal diseases, bone disease, respiratory disease, liver disease, gastrointestinal disease, mental health disorders, chronic pain, neurocognitive disorders, lipodystrophy, dermatological conditions, sexually transmitted infections) in PLWH. We searched Medline, Embase and PsycINFO. Of 2,256 unique citations identified, 22 reviews were eligible for inclusion, 13 in PLWH and 9 in the general population. Common comorbidities in PLWH were cancers, especially anal and lung (10-11 per 100 person-years); chronic kidney disease (CKD) (12.5-17%); cardiovascular diseases (10-11%); hypertension (14.4-21%); non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (14-53%); and depression (7.4-14%). Prevalence of some comorbidities (chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and depression) was higher in PLWH. However, prevalence of non-AIDS-defining malignancies and cardiovascular diseases in PLWH were within the range of estimates for the general population. Comorbidity prevalence is variable, likely reflecting variable demographics, HIV-related risk factors, HIV treatment, and lifestyle risk factors. A number of common comorbidities have a higher prevalence in PLWH and should be managed and treated in a holistic manner in the context of HIV management.\n\n# Introduction\nThe widespread uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has led to marked increases in life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), and this is predicted to continue to increase to almost the same levels as in the general population by 2030 [bib_ref] Mortality in well controlled HIV in the continuous antiretroviral therapy arms of..., Rodger [/bib_ref]. As a consequence, the proportion of older PLWH is increasing rapidly, especially in high-income countries. Currently, nearly one-third of all PLWH are over 50 years old and this is predicted to increase to more\n    Target answer: The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals.\n    Background Question: What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Yes, there are several ways you can protect yourself from infection by HIV:\nCondoms - always use a condom when having sex with a person whose HIV status is unknown to you. Use a new condom for each act of intercourse. See separate leaflet called Condoms (Sheaths).\nSex workers - it is important to make sure that sex workers are protected from becoming infected, and from passing on the infection to others. Most countries have programmes for helping and monitoring prostitutes. It is important not to use the services of prostitutes in countries where such programmes are not in place.\nBlood transfusion - in most developed countries, all blood products are screened for blood-borne viruses, including HIV. People with HIV should not become blood donors.\nSharps injuries - people who work with sharps (such as doctors, nurses and cleaners) are at risk of infection if they have an injury from a used needle. It is therefore important that used sharps are disposed of safely. If you are injured by a used needle, wash the wound under running water. Report the incident to your line manager or occupational health department, so that the risks associated with the injury can be assessed.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis - this involves giving drugs to a person who has had a high-risk exposure to HIV, in order to reduce the chance of infection. The drugs used are a combination of antiretroviral drugs, similar to the drugs used to treat HIV. They should ideally be started within a few hours of exposure, and must be started within 72 hours for them to be effective. Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for:\nDoctors, nurses and other health professionals who have a high-risk exposure to HIV. This could include nurses or doctors who have had a used needlestick injury, or who have been splashed with blood or secretions. However, if a doctor or nurse had sex with someone who is HIV-positive, they would not be eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis. They should, however, be strongly advised to encourage their partner to have a test for HIV.\nSomeone who has had sex with a person who is known to be HIV-positive. For example, if your husband or wife has been diagnosed with HIV and you did not use a condom, you should go to the local accident and emergency department, to discuss the option of having post-exposure prophylaxis.\nSomeone who has had sex with a person who is thought to be high-risk, for example if you had sex with someone you\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

A comparison of daily and intermittent ART for tuberculosis in mice\n\nIntroduction: Current treatment guidelines for drug susceptible tuberculosis require daily treatment for 6 months. Intermittent treatment is known to be associated with inferior efficacy. We evaluated a novel regimen consisting of a combination of three bactericidal drugs administered weekly that might be equally effective to daily therapy. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and randomly allocated to one of five treatment regimens: no treatment (Control), daily treatment with a standard regimen (DHRZ, 14 days), daily treatment with the novel regimen (DHM, 14 days) and treatment with the novel regimen either weekly (DHM weekly) or twice a week (DHM 2x weekly) (both for 42 days). Treatment efficacy was assessed by bacterial load in the lungs at the end of treatment (EOT), and lung histopathology, granuloma resolution and relapse rates at 28 days after treatment discontinuation (28d AOT). Results: DHM 2x weekly had similar efficacy to the standard treatment in terms of bacillary load (EOT, p = 0.17), lung histopathology and granuloma resolution (28d AOT, p = 0.13). However, mice treated with DHM weekly had significantly higher bacillary load (EOT, p = 0.002) and inferior lung histopathology (p = 0.007), with 100% relapse rate by 28d AOT, similar to untreated controls. Conclusion: Daily treatment with a standard regimen (DHRZ) and the novel regimen (DHM) had similar efficacy. A novel regimen (DHM) dosed twice a week for 6 weeks had similar efficacy to a standard daily regimen. Intermittent treatment with a novel regimen (DHM) dosed weekly for 6 weeks was not effective, although this may have been a consequence of the duration of therapy. This finding may have implications for clinical trials, and also for developing countries where health care access is a major barrier to successful TB treatment.\n\n# Introduction\nTuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious causes of mortality, claiming 1.5 million lives in 2018.

Perinatal transmission of HIV can be reduced if: 1. Mother is not breast-feeding and 2. There is appropriate antenatal and intrapartum care. 1. Mother is not breast-feeding The HIV infection is transmitted to child through breast-feeding, and the transmission is much higher among infants fed on breast milk. Therefore, HIV positive mother should be advised to bottle feed the infant rather than to breast-feed. However, in developing countries bottle feeding is not possible because of economic and hygienic conditions. In such cases, if the mother is not on antiretroviral drugs, she should be advised to feed the infant with expressed breast milk. If the mother is on antiretroviral therapy, she can breast-feed her infant safely. 2. Appropriate antenatal and intrapartum care The perinatal transmission of HIV can be prevented by appropriate antenatal and intrapartum care of mother and the new born. The mother should receive antiretroviral drugs from 28 weeks of gestation. After 36 weeks of gestation, she should be administered Zidovudine 300 mg twice a day. In the intrapartum period, she should receive Zidovudine 600 mg orally at the onset of labor and then 300 mg every 3 hours until delivery. The mother should not be given steroids for the acceleration of fetal lung maturity. Also, elective cesarean section should be performed at 38 weeks of gestation. The mother should be counseled for vaginal delivery because it reduces perinatal transmission of HIV by approximately 70 percent. Also, episiotomy and other invasive procedures should be avoided. The infant should be given Zidovudine 4 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for 6 weeks and Nevirapine 2 mg/kg/dose within 72 hours of delivery. This reduces the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV by about 70 percent. The mother should be advised not to breast-feed the infant.\n    Target answer: To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

A common question and one that can be very confusing! So let's start by understanding what HIV is first.\nWhat is HIV?\nHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This is a virus that attacks the immune system. HIV is an RNA virus that causes AIDS by replicating itself. The HIV virus contains reverse transcriptase which allows it to convert its RNA genome to DNA. The virus replicates by inserting a copy of its genetic material into the DNA of the host cell. There is no known cure for HIV/AIDS; however, it is a manageable condition. Once you are diagnosed with HIV, you have HIV for life. A large percentage of people with HIV don't know they are infected. That's why screening is so important. So if you have been sexually active, be sure to be screened for HIV! Also remember to practice safe sex and always use protection.\nWhat is AIDS?\nAIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection. Once you have HIV, you can go years without developing AIDS. With the help of medication and a healthy lifestyle, HIV can be managed and will never develop into AIDS. It is possible to live many years with HIV and never develop AIDS.\nWhat is HIV and AIDS? Learn about the HIV and AIDS difference\nHIV and AIDS - the Difference between the Two\nHIV and AIDS are not interchangeable terms. While all people who have AIDS have HIV, not all people who are HIV positive will develop AIDS.\nSo what happens if you have HIV and you don't get treatment? You may develop AIDS and become susceptible to rare cancers and infections (opportunistic infections) that normally would not affect healthy people. This is because your immune system has been compromised. If left untreated, AIDS may progress from one stage to another and may eventually lead to death.\nThe difference between HIV and AIDS is one you should understand if you are diagnosed with HIV. HIV and AIDS are NOT one in the same. HIV is a condition that is manageable, with or without symptoms. AIDS on the other hand is the last stage of HIV infection, when the immune system has been damaged so much that it is unable to fight infections.\nA person infected with the HIV virus is still able to fight off infections, and so they can continue to live a fairly healthy life with the virus. AIDS is diagnosed when the immune system of an HIV infected person has been so severely damaged that it cannot fight off infections.\nHow Long Does It Take for HIV to Develop into AIDS?\nIn the past,\n    Target answer: HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection.\n    Background Question: What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

This is the third in a series of posts about the transmission of HIV. This week we look at the ways HIV is not transmitted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a great resource to get more information about HIV. Below we will explain how HIV is not transmitted based on the information they provide. HIV is not transmitted through: Air or water Casual contact (shaking hands, hugging, a towel, drinking fountains) Insect bites Saliva, tears or sweat Unless there is blood in the fluid. In this case, there could be a risk of transmission if there is an open wound, or mucous membrane (mouth, eyes, genitals) involved. Toilet seats HIV does not survive long outside of the body. It cannot live on surfaces for a significant amount of time. The virus will quickly die. Deep kissing Unless both partners have sores or bleeding gums, and blood is exchanged. Sharing food, dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils or bathroom. However, if the person with HIV has blood in their mouth or has open sores while eating and drinking, this could be a means of transmission. Saliva, sweat and tears, unless blood is present in them. Sharing clothes, beds or linen. However, if the person with HIV is bleeding, this could be a means of transmission. Coughing and sneezing are not routes of HIV transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have a helpful list of common myths about how HIV is transmitted. To read the full list of myths about HIV transmission, click here. A 2015 study published in the journal AIDS states that: The risk of acquiring HIV infection from an HIV-infected healthcare worker after a percutaneous exposure to blood from a source patient is about 1 in 3,000, and after a mucocutaneous exposure the risk is about 1 in 1,000. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average risk of getting HIV through blood with a needle stick is 1 in 150. Risk through blood transfusion: HIV can be transmitted through the blood. A number of measures have been put in place to prevent this. Donated blood is tested for HIV. All blood donated in the US is tested for 13 infectious agents, including HIV. Blood banks routinely test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 using antibody tests. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of getting HIV through a blood transfusion is extremely low and\n    Target answer: You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin.\n    Background Question: How is HIV not transmitted?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
