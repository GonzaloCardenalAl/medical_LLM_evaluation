(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: How is HIV diagnosed?HIV is diagnosed using blood tests that look for either the virus itself or antibodies that form in response to the virus (figure 1). Most people are diagnosed using a combination of the following tests:\n- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests: This test is also called a serological test. It looks for antibodies against HIV in the blood.\n- Western blot test: This test confirms that HIV antibodies found with the ELISA test are really present and not a false positive.\n- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: This test looks for the virus itself and can be used in newborns (children less than 18 months) who might have a false-positive result on the ELISA or Western blot test. A false-positive result is when a test is positive, but the person does not really have HIV.\n\nWhen should I be tested for HIV?\nMost adults should be tested at least once for HIV. People who have risk factors for HIV should be tested every year. Risk factors include having had unprotected sex with an infected person, using drugs intravenously (with a needle), or having sex with many partners.\n\nIf you think you were exposed to HIV through sex, a needle stick, or another exposure, you should get tested. If it has been less than 3 months since you were exposed, you should be tested again in 3 months. That's because it takes the body time to make antibodies after being infected. The tests used to diagnose HIV look for antibodies.\n\nWomen who are pregnant should be tested for HIV. If they are infected, they can be treated. That reduces the chances that their baby will get HIV.\n\nHow does HIV infection turn into AIDS?\nHIV is the virus that causes AIDS. People who are infected with HIV sometimes get sick or have infections that would not usually happen in people who are not infected. When that happens, they are said to have AIDS.\n\nIf a person with HIV has one of the following conditions or infections, they have AIDS, even if their CD4 cell count is above 200 (CD4 cells are also called \"T cells\"):\n- Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n- Recurrent (more than one) pneumonia\n- Toxoplasmosis of the brain (an infection that can cause trouble thinking)\n- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (an infection that can affect the eyes or other organs)\n- Histoplasmosis (an infection that affects the lungs, digestive system, or other organs\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

For this purpose, an individual is considered to have progressed to AIDS only when one of the AIDS-defining conditions is documented. Stage 3 (AIDS) is diagnosed if the lymphocyte CD4 count goes below 200 cells per cubic millimeter (mm 3 ) of blood. (In general, the normal count is between 800 and 1,200 in healthy adults). For HIV infection, the staging system used in the United States is the one developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1993 [ 1 ] and updated in 2008 [ 2 ].The system is primarily based upon the CD4 cell count, which is an index of the status of the immune system, and categorizes patients according to clinical findings. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a staging system for HIV disease in the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era to define when ART should be started in patients in countries with few health care resources [ 3, 4 ].HIV Stages - CDC HIV-2 staging is the same as HIV-1 staging, except that the time to AIDS is much longer in HIV-2 infection. In HIV-1 infection, the average period between seroconversion and AIDS is 8-10 years, but in HIV-2 infection, this is 15-20 years (perhaps longer) [ 19, 20 ]. Stages of HIV: early and chronic stage (HIV-2 is much less likely to progress to AIDS than HIV-1). Acute stage (duration of 2\u20134 weeks). This stage occurs immediately after infection, when the virus is multiplying rapidly. A person may have no symptoms, mild flu-like symptoms, or an acute retroviral syndrome with symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis.. Acute infection: This is the earliest stage of HIV infection. People with acute infection have a large amount of HIV in the blood. The virus attacks the immune system, causing a decline in the number of CD4 cells (T cells). These cells help the immune system fight off infections. As the immune system weakens, the body is more susceptible to infections. The main symptom of HIV/AIDS is a weakened immune system, making the infected person susceptible to other infections and diseases, including opportunistic infections. These are infections that take advantage of a very weakened immune system. What is HIV/AIDS? | AVERT HIV-2, in comparison, has a much slower rate of CD4 cell count\n    Target answer: The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

It is also possible that sharing a needle and syringe, along with other blood-to-blood contact (for example, receiving blood contaminated with HIV), could lead to infection. Sharing body fluids, like saliva or sweat, is not an effective route of HIV transmission.\n    Target answer: HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids.

What proportion of these comorbidities have been diagnosed and treated?\nInfectious and non-communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, multimorbidity, HIV\nThis is a mixed method systematic review (qualitative and quantitative) using a convergent segregated approach to synthesis. We used Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools for quantitative studies and meta aggregation approach for qualitative synthesis. We included studies that reported data on comorbidities among people living with HIV. We reported on the following outcomes: proportion of infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), comorbidity (\u22652 diseases), multimorbidity (\u22653 diseases) and proportion of diagnosed and treated conditions. For quantitative studies, data extraction was done using a standardized form based on the JBI data extraction form and was piloted. Data synthesis was done using meta-analysis of proportions and a random effects model. Meta regression was used to assess potential sources of heterogeneity. For qualitative synthesis, we performed thematic synthesis of study findings and developed a synthesis grid. Thematic analysis of study findings was done.\nSixty three quantitative studies and two qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Forty eight (76%) studies were from high income countries. NCDs were prevalent among people living with HIV: 20% had chronic kidney disease (CKD), 17% had hypertension, 18% had coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke, 13% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 9% had diabetes. Infectious comorbidities were also common: 22% had tuberculosis (TB), 11% had hepatitis B and 8% had hepatitis C. Comorbidity and multimorbidity were common: 78% had \u22652 diseases and 34% had \u22653 diseases. In studies that reported on the proportion of diagnosed and treated conditions, a substantial proportion of comorbidities were undiagnosed and untreated. For instance, only 55% of those with hypertension were on treatment and 43% of those with COPD were on treatment.\nNCDs, infectious diseases and multimorbidity are prevalent among people living with HIV. A substantial proportion of comorbidities are undiagnosed and untreated. We need to re-orient HIV care to include management of comorbidities. This should include screening, diagnosis and treatment of comorbidities among people living with HIV. We also need to improve integration of infectious disease services to meet the healthcare needs of people living with HIV\n    Target answer: The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals.\n    Background Question: What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: How can HIV be prevented? There are many ways to prevent HIV. The best approach is to use a combination of ways.\nSome of these ways to prevent HIV also help prevent other types of infections that can be spread by sex.\n\nPreventing HIV in people who have been exposed\nPeople can be exposed to HIV in different ways. For instance, a health care worker can be exposed through a needle stick. Someone who has been sexually assaulted or abused can be exposed to HIV during the attack. Or someone who does not have HIV can have sex or share needles with a person who has HIV.\n\nIf you have been exposed to HIV in the past 3 days (72 hours), your doctor might suggest that you take anti-HIV medicines. This can lower your chances of getting infected with HIV. But the medicines only work if you start them soon after you have been exposed. Most people take them for 28 days after they have been exposed.\n\nUsing condoms\nUsing condoms every time you have vaginal or anal sex is a very effective way to prevent HIV. It is also the best way to protect against other infections that can be spread through sex. Examples include gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, and human papillomavirus.\n\nMale condoms, female condoms, and dental dams all work equally well, if used correctly. If you decide to use condoms, make sure to:\n- Use them every time you have vaginal or anal sex\n- Use a new condom for each sex act\n- Open the condom package carefully so you do not tear the condom\n- Use a water-based lubricant with the condom (but never oil-based lubricant)\n- Keep condoms in a cool, dry place\n- Do not use a condom if it is brittle, sticky, or has an unusual odor\n- Always put the condom on before any genital contact\n- Make sure that air is squeezed out of the tip of the condom before putting it on\n- Hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis during intercourse, and during withdrawal\n\nMale condoms are sold at most supermarkets and pharmacies. Female condoms are sold in fewer stores but can be bought online. You can also get condoms at clinics that do family planning or STD prevention.\n\nMale circumcision\n\"Circumcision\" is the medical term for when a doctor surgically removes the foreskin from a man's penis.\n\nStudies done in Africa have found that circumcision helps lower the chances that men will get HIV if they have sex with women who have HIV. Doctors are not sure how circumcision prevents HIV, but they think it\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy in a clinic in Italy: a case series study\n\nBackground: Despite the importance of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), in the literature little information is available about how frequently this should be taken. We aimed to assess if a weekly 7-day treatment schedule is associated with poorer adherence compared to 3-to-5-day ART schedules.Methods: In this retrospective case series study we assessed PLWHA who were prescribed ART between June 1st 2013 and December 31st 2018. Adherence to treatment was measured through two different indices, that is, the medication possession ratio (MPR) and the proportion of days covered (PDC). MPR is defined as the ratio between the number of days of medication supplied and the number of days in the interval; PDC is defined as the number of days with ART medication divided by the number of days between the first prescription and the last refill date, for each patient. We excluded all individuals who were not prescribed ART for a complete year.Results:In all, 1003 individuals were prescribed ART in the study period; of these, 102 were excluded because the prescriptions were not issued for a complete year. The mean MPR and PDC were 0.98 for 7-day treatments and 0.98 and 0.99 for 3-to-5-day treatments, respectively. The proportion of patients with MPR \u2265 0.95 (i.e., a 5% tolerability margin) was 93.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.2-96.2) for 7-day and 96.7% (95% CI 95.1-98.0) for 3-to-5-day treatments. The same proportion with PDC \u2265 0.95 was 93.2% (95% CI 89.2-96.2) for 7-day and 98.7% (95% CI 97.3-99.4) for 3-to-5-day treatments. The MPR and PDC were statistically significantly different between groups (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Despite the statistically significant difference between 7-day and 3-to-5-day treatments, adherence was high, as the percentage of people who took ART with a MPR \u2265 0.95 was > 90% in both groups.\n\n#\n    Target answer: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months.\n    Background Question: How frequently ART must be taken?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

For women living with HIV or acquired HIV infection during pregnancy, can taking HIV medicines during pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to babies?\n## Perinatal transmission of HIV\nIf a woman living with HIV is not treated, there is about a 15 percent chance (1 in 6) that the baby will become infected with HIV during pregnancy, during delivery, or while breastfeeding. The risk increases to 45 percent (almost 1 in 2) if the baby is breastfed by the mother.\n## Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)\nThe good news is that the risk of transmitting HIV to the baby can be greatly reduced when women receive appropriate treatment, even when they breastfeed. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommends HIV medicines for all pregnant women living with HIV, regardless of the viral load. The DHHS guidelines are updated regularly as new information becomes available.\nWhen HIV is detected in a pregnant woman, she should begin a treatment regimen, typically three HIV medicines, as soon as possible after diagnosis. Treatment during pregnancy and childbirth is usually safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. Some HIV medicines are not recommended for use during pregnancy because of problems seen in infants born to women who took these medications. Women taking an HIV regimen during pregnancy should be monitored by both an HIV specialist and an obstetrician who has experience caring for HIV-infected pregnant women.\nIn countries where safe alternatives are readily available and culturally acceptable, the U.S. Public Health Service recommends that HIV-infected women avoid breastfeeding their babies to prevent the transmission of HIV through breast milk. Women in these countries should not breastfeed or provide breast milk for their babies, even if they are taking HIV medicines. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that women living with HIV in the U.S. not breastfeed. Instead, they should feed their babies with formula. While HIV can be spread to a baby through breast milk, it is less common in women whose viral loads are suppressed.\n    Target answer: To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: What are the main cell types infected with HIV? HIV infects the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell, or T-helper cell). Other types of cells that may be infected with HIV include monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and possibly other cells that have CD4 receptors or chemokine receptors for the virus.\n\n## What is the natural history of HIV infection?\nThe natural history of HIV infection is a gradual immunosuppression. The average time from infection to immunosuppression severe enough to be defined as AIDS is approximately 10 years. HIV is transmitted through body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk). Infection is acquired through mucosal or parenteral contact with infected body fluids.\n\n## What factors affect the risk of HIV transmission?\nThe risk of transmission of HIV is affected by the quantity of virus in the infected source, the exposure to blood versus body fluids, and the amount of exposure. The risk is also affected by the immune status of the exposed individual. The risk of transmission from an infected source with a high HIV viral load is much greater than from an infected source with a low viral load. Transmission by needle-stick injury is less efficient than by sexual contact.\n\n## What is a viral load, and why is it important in HIV infection?\nThe viral load is the amount of HIV RNA that is detectable in the blood. It is a direct measure of HIV activity and replication in the body. Viral load is important because it is the best predictor of disease progression. It is also the most important indicator of response to antiretroviral therapy.\n\n## What is the difference between a latent and a productive infection?\nLatent infection refers to cells that are infected with HIV but not actively making virus. Productive infection refers to cells that are infected with HIV and actively making virus. Antiretroviral therapy targets productive infections and suppresses viral replication.\n\n## What is AIDS?\nAIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses two criteria to diagnose AIDS: (1) CD4 count of less than 200/microL or (2) presence of one or more AIDS-defining illnesses.\n\n## What are the most common symptoms in a person with a CD4 count of 0 to 200?\nFever, chills, fatigue, and night sweats are most common. Other common symptoms include weight loss, malaise, diarrhea, headache, and rash.\n\n## What is the major problem facing persons infected with HIV?\nIn the absence\n    Target answer: The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells.\n    Background Question: What are the main cell types infected with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: How is HIV not transmitted?.\n## How is HIV transmitted?\n### Transmission by Sexual Contact\nSexual contact is the most frequent mode of HIV transmission (table 1) [25]. The main factors affecting the probability of transmission by this route include the viral load of the source, the presence of sexually transmitted disease (STD) or genital ulcerations, the type of sexual exposure, and biological factors [25-27].\n\nThe virus can be transmitted by both receptive and insertive vaginal and anal intercourse and by oral sex. The estimated risk of HIV acquisition from condomless vaginal sex with a person aware of their HIV infection in the United States is 1 per 1250 for the insertive partner and 1 per 900 for the receptive partner (table 2). Risk is increased when the source has a high viral load [28].\n\nThe risk of HIV transmission from receptive anal intercourse is estimated to be 1 per 72 sex acts (table 2). Risk of transmission from oral sex is estimated to be much lower, although precise data are not available [29-31].\n\nHIV transmission has been reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) after various other sex practices. The risk of HIV transmission has been reported to be as high as 5 per 10,000 episodes for insertive oral sex and 6.5 per 10,000 episodes for receptive oral sex [32]. (See \"HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies\", section on 'Sexual transmission risk'.)\n\n### Transmission via blood or blood products\nIn resource-rich settings, the risk of HIV transmission from transfused blood is now vanishingly small due to routine testing and the short time between collection, testing, and transfusion. In resource-limited settings, the risk of HIV transmission by transfusion remains high [33].\n\nTransmission of HIV is possible after inadvertent exposure to potentially contaminated blood by percutaneous (via a needlestick or other sharp object) or mucocutaneous routes (eg, conjunctival exposure). The risk of HIV infection varies by the type of exposure. The risk of seroconversion after a percutaneous exposure from an HIV-infected source is approximately 3 in 1000 [34]. The risk is much lower for exposure of contaminated material to intact skin (approximately 0.09 percent) and to mucous membranes (0 to 0.09 percent) [35,36]. Transmission of HIV through a human bite is theoretically possible if there is a blood exposure, but no such cases have been documented.\n    Target answer: You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin.\n    Background Question: How is HIV not transmitted?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
