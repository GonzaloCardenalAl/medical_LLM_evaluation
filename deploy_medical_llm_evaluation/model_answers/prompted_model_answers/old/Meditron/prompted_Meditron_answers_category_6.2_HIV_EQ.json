During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis? RATIONALE: The patient\u2019s history of uncontrolled HIV infection is essential to diagnosing this case. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) typically affect patients with poorly controlled HIV. In the post-HAART era, the risk of developing HAND has been reduced by 50%. However, approximately 15-40% of HIV patients have HAND and 2-5% have HIV-associated dementia. The patient\u2019s recent forgetfulness and cognitive decline as well as his inability to perform complex tasks are suggestive of HAND. Additionally, the disseminated white matter lesions seen on his MRI and the absence of mass effect and enhancement are consistent with this diagnosis. Other causes of dementia and brain atrophy such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are less likely in this case. The patient\u2019s young age makes Alzheimer's disease unlikely. Furthermore, in vascular dementia, multiple strokes (lacunar infarcts) typically lead to a stepwise decline in cognitive function, whereas the patient\u2019s decline in cognitive function appears more gradual. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia that typically presents with short-term memory loss, personality changes, and disorientation. As the disease progresses, patients become apathetic, agitated, and eventually lose control of their bladder and bowel. Although AD most commonly occurs in the elderly, it can be an important differential diagnosis in the young. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. It usually occurs in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or diabetes, and typically presents with cognitive impairment after a stroke. Patients can have a history of multiple strokes (lacunar infarcts) that lead to a stepwise decline in cognitive function. White matter hyperintensities may be present on imaging.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls.

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?  Rationale: Zidovudine is associated with bone marrow suppression, causing anemia, neutropenia, or both. The risk is greatest within the first 12 weeks of therapy, in patients who are underweight, and in patients with an advanced disease. Treatment should be stopped if the granulocyte count falls below 750 cells/\u03bcL. Indinavir is associated with nephrolithiasis due to drug precipitation in the urine, particularly when urine flow is reduced or the urine is concentrated. Thus, patients must be advised to drink plenty of water. This complication may be averted or managed by ensuring adequate hydration. Lamivudine is generally well tolerated and is not associated with clinically significant side effects.\nAnswer: D\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night.

This transmission can occur during:\n\n*   Intrauterine life (during pregnancy)\n*   Intrapartum (during labor and delivery)\n*   Postpartum (during breastfeeding)\n\nSeveral factors influence the likelihood of HIV transmission from mother to child:\n\n*   **High maternal viral load**: Higher levels of HIV in the mother's blood increase the risk of transmission.\n*   **Low maternal CD4 count**: Lower levels of CD4 cells in the mother's blood indicate a weakened immune system, increasing the risk of transmission.\n*   **Mother's lack of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy**: Not receiving ART during pregnancy increases the risk of transmission.\n*   **Preterm birth**: Babies born before 37 weeks of gestation are at a higher risk of HIV transmission.\n*   **Intrapartum maternal bleeding**: Excessive bleeding during labor and delivery increases the risk of transmission.\n*   **Prolonged duration of rupture of membranes**: When the water breaks, the risk of transmission increases with time.\n*   **Breastfeeding**: HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, especially if the mother is not on ART.\n\n### Prevention Strategies\nTo reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, several strategies are employed:\n\n*   **Antiretroviral therapy for the mother**: ART is administered to the mother during pregnancy, labor, and delivery to reduce her viral load and lower the risk of transmission.\n*   **Antiretroviral therapy for the newborn**: The newborn is given antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection after birth.\n*   **Elective cesarean section**: Delivering the baby via cesarean section can reduce the risk of transmission.\n*   **Avoiding breastfeeding**: In many cases, mothers with HIV are advised not to breastfeed their babies to prevent transmission.\n\n### Treatment for the Newborn\nTo prevent HIV infection, the newborn should be administered:\n\n*   **Zidovudine**: An antiretroviral medication that helps prevent HIV infection.\n*   **Nevirapine**: Another antiretroviral medication that helps prevent HIV infection.\n\nThe newborn should receive these medications as soon as possible after birth, and the mother should continue her antiretroviral therapy during breastfeeding if she chooses to breastfeed. In the United States, it is recommended to avoid breastfeeding to minimize\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman.
