Discussion: In a cohort study carried out with 9,449 adults (25% HIV+), it was found a higher incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (1.3% vs. 0.6%), stroke (1.3% vs. 0.4%) and CVD (2.3% vs. 1.1%) in HIV-infected individuals. Among HIV+ patients, statin users showed a significantly lower incidence of CAD (0.6% vs. 1.7%) and CVD (1.3% vs. 2.6%). No differences were observed in HIV\u2212 individuals. In a prospective cohort study with 21, 963 HIV+ individuals, statin therapy was associated with 51% lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but no association was observed with stroke or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The reduction of the risk of MI was more relevant with rosuvastatin (hazard ratio 0.29). The reduction of the risk of MI associated with statin therapy was observed both in individuals with CVD and CVD risk \u2265 10% or with lower CVD risk. The use of statins was associated with a lower incidence of CAD in HIV+ individuals, but not in HIV\u2212 individuals. The use of statins may be considered in HIV+ individuals with CVD or with CVD risk \u2265 10%, independently of their HIV status, and in HIV+ individuals with lower CVD risk. Disclosure of Interest None declared Introduction: Despite the high prevalence of smoking among PLHIV, the rate of smoking cessation is much lower than among the general population. We present the results of a smoking cessation clinic among PLHIV in a large, academic, infectious diseases clinic. Methods: From February 2016 to July 2017, PLHIV who were active smokers and interested in quitting were enrolled in a 12-week, telephone-based smoking cessation clinic. The first 6 weeks of the program consisted of weekly phone calls from a smoking cessation counselor; the last 6 weeks consisted of twice monthly phone calls. Counseling sessions followed the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy and included provision of a self-help booklet. Participants received nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline (VAR) in a manner consistent with the clinical recommendations of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The primary outcome was 7-day point-prevalence smoking cessation at 6 months following enrollment. Results: Fifty-eight participants were enrolled\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive.

I only have time to attend one of them. Who should I attend? Of course I have to attend the woman.\nIs this statement morally acceptable? Well, no, if we look at a utilitarian perspective. What I should have done is to ask them which one of them is more ill and take that person. However, what I did is morally acceptable for me, because this patient was a woman. Even if she was a bit more healthy than the male, I will see her.\nI\u2019m a feminist and a sexist, at the same time. You see, I have an unconscious bias towards women and I have an unconscious bias towards men. But I want to be sexist and I want to be feminist. It is in my best interest to be sexist because being a feminist does not come easy. I believe that the way we think is sexist and the way our world works is sexist. When we are a child we are being raised in a world that is sexist. We are taught what it is like to be a man and what it is like to be a woman. When we become older, it is not so easy to undo all of that.\nLet me be clear, when I say that our world is sexist, I mean it is sexist against both women and men. If you are a woman you should be emotional, and if you are a man you should be strong. It is not easy to be a feminist, but it is easy to be sexist.\nI have made a conscious decision to be sexist. I want to be a sexist because I want to be a feminist. I have chosen to be sexist and to be feminist in favor of women. To be sexist against men means that I give women more priority. As a feminist, I have to be sexist against men.\nWhen you are a feminist, you have to be a sexist. Feminism is, of course, an ideology and every ideology is biased. You want to see women as a group that is marginalized and men as a group that is privileged. Therefore, when you are a feminist you are always biased towards women.\nThere is, of course, a bias towards women, in our society. It is very obvious when you look at the gender pay gap and at domestic violence. It is obvious when you see how many women are raped. But there is also a bias towards men. When you are a man, you are expected to be strong and to not be emotional. When you are a woman, you are expected to be emotional and to be caring.

(This is not a hypothetical question, as we have a shortage in the country where I am practicing. The shortage will probably last for 2 weeks, until a new shipment of drugs arrives. I hope to God the new shipment arrives sooner.)\nI am a physician, and I feel guilty asking the question. I just feel that I have to make a tough decision and I would like some other people's opinion on this. I am not making a discrimination against the Asian man, as it was the European man that got the medication first. The man is also not my friend or relative. I just feel that the European man has better prognosis with the ART. But is it ethical to discontinue the Asian man's ART?\nI have been searching for answers, but I am not a ethicist, and I don't really have the time and resources to study this problem. Also, I am not asking for legal advice (I don't know what the law says about this, nor do I care what the law says), nor am I asking for religious advice (I know what I believe in). I would like some expert opinions on the ethics of this.\nNote: I have to make the decision quickly, and the new drugs will probably arrive within two weeks, so the European man will be on ART for only two weeks and the Asian man will be off ART for two weeks. It is possible to ask the Asian man to stop taking his medication. This is not a hypothetical question. The Asian man is also on ART for the first time. The European man has been on ART for several years, and his prognosis is very good.\nI have no idea what the laws are, nor do I care. The Asian man is a citizen of the country I am in, while the European man is not a citizen (I am not a citizen of this country, either). The European man may need a prescription from me to get medication in his country (which he is very likely to get because his country has a lot of ART). The Asian man cannot get medication in his country because his country does not have enough ART, and he may die because of this. But the Asian man is also very likely to be able to get medications from me when the new shipment arrives.\nPlease note that the Asian man may die if he does not receive ART for 2 weeks.

In our opinion: no\nIntroduction: Recent studies suggest that black ethnicity is a significant determinant of HIV-1 infection, but these studies have been unable to exclude confounding by lifestyle differences. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey, including a self-administered questionnaire and HIV-1 testing, in young, sexually active adults, in the two main ethnic groups of Cape Town, South Africa, where the HIV-1 epidemic is concentrated. Results: Of the 1091 respondents, 32.9% were white, 61.9% were coloured, and 5.2% were other ethnicities. Unprotected penetrative sex with a partner of unknown serostatus was reported by 51.8% of men and 56.4% of women. The HIV prevalence in black people (defined as 'coloured' and 'black African' in our study) was 9.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9, 11.9] and 0.7% (95% CI 0.1, 2.1) in white people. After controlling for socio-economic variables, age and sexual behaviour, the odds ratio for HIV infection in black people compared with white people was 1.28 (95% CI 0.32, 5.09). There was no association between black ethnicity and HIV infection. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that socio-economic status, as opposed to ethnicity, is the most important determinant of HIV infection in South Africa.\n\n# Introduction\nBlack ethnicity has been consistently associated with HIV infection in many studies from the USA [bib_ref] Risk factors for HIV-1 infection among low-income Latino women in Los Angeles..., Eldredge [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risk factors for HIV infection among intravenous drug users in San Francisco, Moss [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Determinants of HIV infection among Latino women in California, Ruiz [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in homosexual men, Winkelstein [/bib_ref] and the UK [bib_ref] Risk factors for heterosexually acquired HIV-1 infection in Jamaica: a casecontrol study, Figueroa [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Human immunodeficiency virus infection among women in intravenous drug abuse treatment programs..., Schuman [/bib_ref], even after adjustment for behavioural and socioeconomic variables.

That it's important to be tested, and if they are found to be positive they should learn everything they can about treatment and prevention, and they should not have sex without using a condom.

Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis? A) HIV infection B) HIV infection and acute Lyme disease C) Acute HIV infection D) Acute Lyme disease\n**Understanding the Diagnosis**\n\nThe patient's symptoms are indicative of a systemic infection, and the differential diagnosis includes both HIV and Lyme disease. However, the presentation of the symptoms and the patient's recent activities can help determine the most likely diagnosis.\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\n- **Symptoms and Timeline**:\n  - Erythema migrans rash: A characteristic symptom of Lyme disease, typically appearing 10 days after a tick bite.\n  - Fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, palpitations, and dizziness: Symptoms that can be associated with both HIV and Lyme disease.\n- **Recent Activities**:\n  - Unprotected anal receptive intercourse: Increases the risk of HIV transmission.\n  - Hiking trip in an endemic area: Increases the risk of Lyme disease.\n- **Cardiac Involvement**:\n  - Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities are a characteristic feature of Lyme disease, which can manifest as palpitations and dizziness.\n\n### Distinguishing Features\n\n- **HIV Infection**: Typically presents with acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) symptoms, such as fever, rash, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, within 2-4 weeks after exposure. The patient's symptoms, particularly the erythema migrans rash and cardiac involvement, are more consistent with Lyme disease.\n- **Lyme Disease**: The presence of an erythema migrans rash and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities strongly suggests Lyme disease. The patient's recent hiking trip in an endemic area also increases the likelihood of Lyme disease.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, recent activities, and the characteristic features of Lyme disease, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n### Answer:\nD) Acute Lyme disease\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area.

The HIV viral load shows 190 copies/mL. Should I offer an alternative to natural birth? I think of a cesarean.\nThe risk of mother-to-child transmission is higher with vaginal birth than cesarean section.\nIn case of vaginal delivery, the risk of mother-to-child transmission for HIV-positive women on effective antiretroviral therapy is 1%.\nThe risk of mother-to-child transmission can be reduced to 0.2% by opting for cesarean section.\nThis recommendation is based on research performed in the pre-ART era (1987 to 1993) and before the current highly active ART.\nAt this time, women received no antiretroviral drugs or only a single molecule (zidovudine).\nThe study showed that cesarean section was effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission only if the intervention was performed before the start of labor.\nThe same study reported that no reduction in the risk of transmission was observed if the cesarean was performed after the start of labor.\nAccording to more recent data, viral load is the key factor influencing the risk of mother-to-child transmission.\nCesarean section has no impact on the risk of mother-to-child transmission among women with a viral load below 1000 copies/mL.\nThe risk of mother-to-child transmission increases significantly when the viral load is greater than 1000 copies/mL.\nAccording to more recent data, cesarean section does not appear to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission in women with a viral load below 1000 copies/mL.\nWe recommend that you not offer a cesarean section for delivery if a pregnant woman's viral load is below 1000 copies/mL.\n    Target answer: An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery. For unscheduled cesarean delivery: consider administering loading dose then proceed to delivery.\n    Background Question: A 34-year-old HIV-positive pregnant woman presents for a check-up at week 36.
