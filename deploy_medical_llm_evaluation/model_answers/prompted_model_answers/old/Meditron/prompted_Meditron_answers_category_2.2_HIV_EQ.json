How many antiretroviral drugs were in the combination therapy of patients who died between 1998 and 2002?\n\n# Methods\nThe HIV Cohort Study is a collaboration of all HIV treatment centres in Switzerland. The aim of the SHCS is to document all patients receiving antiretroviral treatment. As of 2002, over 14 000 patients were followed in the SHCS. We considered all SHCS participants with a first positive HIV test reported before December 2002 and who were not lost to follow-up before the 31 st of December 2002 (i.e. the date of their last visit to the SHCS was after the 31 st of December 2002 or the participant was reported to have died). For this study we excluded all patients who were lost to follow-up (i.e. patients who had a last visit to a participating centre before the 31 st of December 2002 and did not re-visit another centre until the 31 st of December 2002). Data on vital status are reported to the SHCS for all participants, but information on reasons of death are collected only for patients who died in a participating centre. Of 16 325 patients with a first positive HIV test in the SHCS, 14 335 were still followed-up in a participating centre in 2002. Of those, 1208 patients died before the 31 st of December 2002.\nThe SHCS collects data on vital status, sex, age, HIV transmission category, initial AIDS defining event, date of first positive HIV test, last CD4+ cell count and viral load, antiretroviral treatment (type, date of first prescription and change of treatment), date of diagnosis and cause of death. In 2002 the most frequent causes of death were recorded in each centre. The information is then entered in the SHCS database by the central data manager.

In order to provide information on the prescription patterns of antiretroviral drugs and on the evolution of the therapy costs, the SHCS compiles annually an overview of the antiretroviral therapy used by SHCS participants.\nIn 2010, the five most prescribed antiretroviral drugs (ARV) among 8\u2019500 HIV-infected patients in care were Tenofovir (43.3%), Emtricitabine (37.5%), Efavirenz (24.7%), Abacavir (21.5%) and Lopinavir (16.4%). The majority of antiretroviral treatments (88.5%) were prescribed in the form of combination tablets. The proportion of antiretroviral treatments including the combination tablet Atripla\u00ae (Tenofovir, Emtricitabine and Efavirenz) increased from 13.4% in 2009 to 17.2% in 2010. Furthermore, a decrease was observed in the proportion of protease inhibitor-based therapy (-2.9%) and a parallel increase in the proportion of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapy (+ 2.3%). Overall, there were only small changes in prescription patterns, with Tenofovir and Emtricitabine still being the most prescribed antiretroviral drugs and Atripla\u00ae the most prescribed fixed-dose combination tablet. Furthermore, the Swiss drug costs for antiretroviral treatment remained stable during 2009 and 2010.\n    Target answer: The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs  were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Consequently, they might be more inclined to have children than before. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV infection in 2010. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the birth rate among HIV-positive women in Switzerland. All 16 HIV reference centres in Switzerland and all 10 antenatal services in Switzerland participated in this study. HIV-positive women were identified from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and all HIV-positive women attending antenatal care were identified from the participating antenatal services. Results: 1,773 HIV-positive women between the ages of 18-49 were included. A total of 44 HIV-positive women delivered a child in 2010. The birth rate was 2.49 per 100 women per year in HIV-positive women. The mean age at childbirth was 30.8 years (SD \u00b15.3 years) and the mean age at HIV diagnosis was 27.3 years (SD \u00b15.8 years). The mean number of children was 1.34 (SD \u00b10.96), of which 0.44 (SD \u00b10.52) were born before and 0.90 (SD \u00b10.72) after the HIV diagnosis. All of the infants born in 2010 were HIV-uninfected.Conclusion: The birth rate in HIV-positive women was lower than in the general Swiss population. The average number of children born after HIV diagnosis was higher than before. The results show that HIV-positive women in Switzerland were willing to have children and that HIV can be prevented from mother to child in Switzerland.\n\n# Background\nWomen infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) live longer since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996. In Switzerland the median survival time after the HIV diagnosis is about 20 years. As HIV is no longer a life-threatening disease for those with good access to medication, women might be more inclined to have children than before.

[bib_ref] The impact of AIDS on women in Africa, Barnett [/bib_ref] However, with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the risk of vertical transmission has decreased significantly from 25% to 1% in the USA, and women with HIV infection are now reaching reproductive age, becoming pregnant and desiring children. [bib_ref] Reproductive health and human rights, Gruskin [/bib_ref] In Switzerland, the prevalence of HIV infection in women of reproductive age is estimated to be 0.1%. 4 Due to the availability of potent ART and the good accessibility to care in this country, the risk of vertical transmission is <1%.The availability of ART, which is the main driver of the risk of vertical transmission, is also the major cause for the reduction in maternal mortality and morbidity from 30% to <1%. [bib_ref] Survival of children born to HIV-positive mothers, by feeding modality, in Rakai, Ssegujja [/bib_ref] With the significant improvement in the overall prognosis and in quality of life of HIV-infected persons, the management of HIV infection has changed from a terminal disease to a chronic disease. As such, HIV-infected persons are able to lead a normal life including pregnancy and family planning.\nHowever, the current guidelines from the European AIDS Clinical Society recommend against pregnancy in women with HIV infection if not on ART and in the presence of a detectable viral load.

They found that the pregnancy rate was lower in the HIV group (15% of all women of reproductive age were pregnant) compared with the non-HIV group (18% of all women of reproductive age were pregnant). However, no data on the birth rate (defined as the rate of deliveries in the 12 months before the interview) in women with HIV were available, which is of importance, especially because Switzerland is a country with a very high standard of living and excellent access to HIV care and treatment.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the birth\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

This systematic review aims to examine the difference between the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 in PWH tested before and after the age of 20. It will compare the time it took for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 for each individual. A meta-analysis will be conducted if the data is appropriate. All results will be recorded and discussed to identify a pattern and establish whether or not there is a difference between the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between individuals tested before and after the age of 20. The meta-analysis will also provide a quantitative value for the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 for both groups of participants. If there is no difference, the results will indicate that the age at which the individual is tested is not significant. This could be due to the fact that the virus could be in the body for a number of years before testing positive, which could have caused the T-cell count to drop below 200 before being detected.\n\n# Introduction\nA person is considered to be HIV positive if they are diagnosed with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If the virus is not treated, it can lead to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which is the most advanced stage of HIV infection [bib_ref] The immune system -an overview, Parham [/bib_ref]. The immune system produces immune cells and proteins that help to fight off infections. White blood cells (WBCs) are the immune cells that help to fight off infections. Some WBCs, such as T-cells, can recognise and kill infected cells or produce chemical signals that activate the immune response. There are two different types of T-cells: CD4+ and CD8+. CD4+ T-cells, also known as T helper cells, play an important role in helping to fight off infections. CD4+ T-cells are covered in receptors called CD4 receptors. HIV can infect CD4+ T-cells by attaching itself to the CD4 receptor. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells and uses the host's cells to make copies of itself. As a result, the infected CD4+ T-cells die and more and more CD4+ T-cells are infected. Therefore, as the disease progresses, the number of CD4+ T-cells gradually decreases in the body [bib_ref] The immune system -an overview, Par\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
