[/fig]\n[fig] R: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus. It has a worldwide distribution and typically affects immunosuppressed patients (e.g., HIV, cancer chemotherapy). There are no characteristic findings on routine laboratory testing, although the CD4 count is typically less than 200/\u00b5L. MRI is the test of choice. It shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions that typically spare the cortex and U fibers, and are most frequently located in the parietal and frontal lobes. PCR testing for the JC virus in the cerebrospinal fluid is helpful. If the PCR is negative and there is high clinical suspicion, brain biopsy may be indicated. PML typically carries a poor prognosis, and death often occurs within a few months.

These tests are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus.\n\n### Recommended Initial Prenatal Tests:\n\n- **Rh Typing (A):** This test is recommended for all pregnant women to determine their blood type and identify those at risk for Rh incompatibility. However, Rh typing is not required to be done during the initial prenatal visit.\n- **Chlamydia trachomatis (B):** This test is recommended for all pregnant women under the age of 25 and for those at high risk, such as those with a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or multiple sexual partners. However, it is not required to be done during the initial prenatal visit.\n- **Neisseria gonorrhoeae (C):** This test is recommended for all pregnant women under the age of 25 and for those at high risk, such as those with a history of STIs or multiple sexual partners. However, it is not required to be done during the initial prenatal visit.\n- **Rubella Antibodies (D):** This test is recommended for all pregnant women to assess immunity to rubella (German measles). Women who are not immune should receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine after delivery.\n- **PPD (E):** This test is recommended for all pregnant women with certain risk factors, such as a history of close contact with someone with tuberculosis (TB), a history of travel to areas with high TB prevalence, or a history of TB exposure. However, it is not required to be done during the initial prenatal visit.\n\n### Answer:\nD.

Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy.

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis? See Tutorial 33 for the explanation.\nExplanation:\nCNS Toxoplasma infection should be the first consideration in a patient with advanced AIDS (CD4+ <100 cells/\u03bcL) presenting with neurological symptoms and signs and ring-enhancing brain lesions. However, the patient described in the vignette has an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated CNS lesion (EBV can be detected in PCNSL). The combination of a solitary ring-enhancing brain lesion and positive PCR for EBV DNA from the CSF is suggestive of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL typically presents as a solitary, deep cerebral lesion in individuals with advanced AIDS. Diagnosis is often made by PCR to identify EBV DNA in the CSF or biopsy to identify large, atypical B-lymphocytes (immunoblasts). Stereotactic biopsy can establish a diagnosis. PCNSL is treated with corticosteroids to reduce edema and intravenous methotrexate for up to 48 weeks. Patients with AIDS-related PCNSL are also treated with antiretroviral therapy. This combination has been shown to improve survival from 3 to 6 months (with radiation and steroids) to up to 14 months. Patients with HIV infection and low CD4+ counts are at risk of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is associated with multiple, deep brain ring-enhancing lesions. This diagnosis is often based on serology and brain imaging and is treated empirically with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine and folic acid, in addition to antiretroviral therapy. An alternative diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, which typically presents with symptoms and signs of chronic meningitis, including headache and changes in mental status. The CSF is frequently unremarkable except for a positive cryptococcal antigen and positive India ink stain. Patients with advanced AIDS are also at risk of cerebral tuberculosis, which is suggested by multiple ring-enhancing lesions with positive acid-fast bacilli staining. PCNSL can be difficult to distinguish from cerebral toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis, because all are associated with ring-enhancing lesions, and all occur in patients with advanced AIDS.\n Answer: E\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks.

Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?**\n### Management of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Infants\nTo prevent perinatal transmission, antiretroviral therapy is offered to all HIV-infected pregnant women and their neonates. The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve an undetectable viral load prior to delivery. HIV-infected women with a viral load of less than 1000 copies/mL are generally advised to have a vaginal delivery. Those with a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL have a cesarean section if performed before the onset of labor and before rupture of the membranes, to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Women with a viral load less than 1000 copies/mL do not require scheduled cesarean delivery. There are two mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HIV: transmission that occurs during pregnancy and results in an infected infant at birth (congenital transmission) and transmission that occurs during birth (perinatal transmission). The risk of congenital transmission is low, particularly in infants born to women on antiretroviral therapy and with undetectable viral loads. The risk of perinatal transmission is reduced by cesarean section, but it remains greater than that of congenital transmission. Therefore, all neonates born to HIV-infected women should receive antiretroviral therapy to prevent perinatal transmission. The specific antiretroviral regimen for the neonate depends on maternal antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and maternal viral load at delivery. Neonates born to women who have taken antiretroviral therapy and have achieved an undetectable viral load at the time of delivery should receive zidovudine for 4-6 weeks. If maternal viral load is greater than 400 copies/mL during pregnancy, or if antiretroviral therapy was initiated during labor or after delivery, the neonate should receive zidovudine and nevirapine for 2-6 weeks. If maternal antiretroviral therapy was not received during pregnancy and labor, the neonate should receive zidovudine, nevirapine, and lamivudine for 2-6 weeks.\n\n### Answer:\nB. Start zidovudine\n#### Explanation:\nHIV-infected pregnant women are offered antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV. Women with an undetectable viral load may have a vaginal delivery. HIVinfected women are also advised to avoid breastfeeding. (\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman.
