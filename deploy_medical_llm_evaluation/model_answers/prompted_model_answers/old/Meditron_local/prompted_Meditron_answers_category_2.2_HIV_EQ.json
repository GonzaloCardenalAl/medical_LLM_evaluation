HIV infected women now have access to adequate treatment, which not only ensures their survival, but also provides the means to reduce the risk of transmission to their partners and children. This leads to an increased desire to have children in these women, which, in turn, raises concerns of care providers and policy makers regarding their own capacity to provide appropriate care to these women. The aims of the study are to assess the overall birth rate (OBR) of women with HIV in Switzerland, to compare it to the OBR of women without HIV and to identify determinants of the fertility of women with HIV.Methods/design: Cross-sectional survey using the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and Swiss Mother-Child Cohort Study and population-based cohort study using the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (n= 3,500) and the Swiss population as reference (n = 4'000'000). Primary outcome measure is the overall birth rate. In the first part of the study, the OBR in women with HIV (SHCS cohort) and without HIV (SMCCS cohort) will be compared. The study sample in the SHCS cohort includes all women between 15 and 49 years with HIV. The study sample of the SMCCS cohort consists of a subpopulation of women between 15 and 49 years without HIV. In the second part of the study, the SHCS cohort is used to analyse determinants of OBR among women with HIV, e.g. marital status, nationality and duration of HIV infection.Discussion:The results of this study will help to estimate the demand of HIV infected women in Switzerland for obstetrical services and to provide care givers and policy makers with data that is needed to plan resources and health care services for these women.\n\n# Background\nA woman living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is confronted with a complex health situation requiring a large part of her energy to preserve her own health and to prevent transmission to others.

In Switzerland, HIV-positive women with viral suppression and a CD4 count above 350 cells/\u00b5L have a very low risk of transmitting the infection to their unborn child. However, little is known about HIV-positive women and their desire to have children in Switzerland. The objective of this study was to investigate if there are differences in the birth rate between women with and without HIV in Switzerland.Methods: Systematic review of cross-sectional and retrospective studies. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and the WHO databases were searched, using keywords relating to pregnancy and HIV. Studies were included if they were conducted in Switzerland, reported the number of births in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, and were published in the last ten years. The quality assessment was carried out according to the Cochrane guidelines. The primary outcome was the number of births per 100 women of childbearing age (10-45 years old) in women with and without HIV. The secondary outcome was the number of births per 100 women with and without HIV who wanted a child.Results: From the databases and websites 1.043 records were identified, but no studies met the inclusion criteria. The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) provided the only dataset that came close to our inclusion criteria. Of 1,013 HIV-positive women of reproductive age, 4.4% had a child in 2017. The birth rate of HIV-negative women of the same age in Switzerland was 10.3%. The difference between women with and without HIV was statistically significant (p = 0.0003).Conclusions: Women with HIV are significantly less likely to have children than women without HIV in Switzerland. However, the birth rate in the HIV-positive population seems to be increasing. The reasons for this difference in the birth rate should be investigated in the future. The fact that the literature on this topic in Switzerland is so scarce indicates a lack of research into the fertility of HIV-positive women in Switzerland.\npregnant women to their unborn child are 0.1-2%, depending on the type of intervention and adherence to ART [bib_ref] Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes of Women Infected With HIV by Geographic Region:..., Filteau\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

However, there are indications that the number of new HIV infections has been increasing in recent years. There is only limited information on the actual routes of infection. We therefore conducted a nationwide survey of the most common risk factors for HIV transmission in Switzerland.Methods: All patients seen at the 13 university and major regional hospitals of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were screened for eligibility. Patients \u00bc 16 years of age were included if they had a confirmed positive HIV test and an unknown or positive risk factor for HIV infection. Patients were asked to complete a structured questionnaire to determine the most likely cause of their HIV infection. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.Results: Between January 2003 and January 2007, 1,117 patients were recruited. The median age was 38 years and 76% of the patients were male. The main transmission categories were men who have sex with men (MSM, 49.2%), heterosexual sex (39.6%), intravenous drug use (IDU, 7.6%), and a small group of patients whose infection occurred at birth or during blood transfusions (3.4%). Among patients who reported heterosexual sex as their main source of infection, 58% reported no additional risk factor such as sexually transmitted diseases (STD), multiple sex partners or sex in foreign countries, particularly in regions with high endemic rates of HIV infection.Conclusions: In Switzerland, homosexual and heterosexual sex are the most common routes of HIV transmission. It is noteworthy that more than half of the patients who reported heterosexual sex as their most likely source of HIV infection did not give an explanation for the transmission other than having heterosexual intercourse. This finding underscores the need for an increased awareness of the general public, especially for those with regular heterosexual partners. Sex education and prevention programs that emphasize the risk of heterosexual transmission should therefore be encouraged. IDU remains a major source of infection, especially in certain regions in Switzerland and should be the target of specific prevention programs. Finally, the fact that HIV infection in Switzerland is no longer a lethal disease should not influence our efforts to prevent new infections.

The aims were to estimate the prevalence of drug non-adherence in the last month and in the last year in a large, random population of patients with epilepsy and to evaluate the impact of non-adherence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.\nAdult patients with epilepsy were randomly selected from a large database of patients with epilepsy who had previously participated in surveys. Patients were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire covering adherence to their medication, epilepsy-related healthcare costs, epilepsy symptoms, comorbidities, and quality of life.\nOne thousand eight hundred and two patients with epilepsy (mean age 44 years; 52% male) were identified and received the questionnaire. Of these, 1,031 patients (57%) completed the questionnaire. 37% of respondents reported missing at least one dose in the previous month, and 60% reported missing at least one dose in the previous year. The factors most strongly associated with non-adherence in the previous month were comorbidity and being a parent, while age and polytherapy were also significant factors. Poor adherence was strongly associated with increased epilepsy-related healthcare costs, worse outcomes, and reduced quality of life.\nTreatment adherence was poor in this large, random population of patients with epilepsy. Poor adherence had a significant impact on healthcare costs, outcomes, and quality of life. These results highlight the need for improved strategies for measuring adherence, encouraging adherence, and improving outcomes in patients with epilepsy.\n\n# Introduction\nAlthough most patients with epilepsy achieve seizure freedom through antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, poor adherence to AED therapy is widespread and has important implications for clinical practice [bib_ref] A systematic review of adherence rates in patients with antiepileptic drugs, Asadi-Pooya [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Adherence to antiepileptic drugs and seizure reduction, Cramer [/bib_ref]. Patients with epilepsy are significantly less likely to adhere to their AED treatment regimen than patients treated for other chronic conditions [bib_ref] A systematic review of the prevalence and risk factors for nonadherence to..., Faught [/bib_ref]. This could be due, in part, to the fact that patients with epilepsy are often symptom-free. The most widely accepted definition of adherence is the extent to which a person's behavior-taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider [bib_ref] Adherence to medication,\n    Target answer: Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
