For each centre, the following information was collected: the number of pregnant women with HIV in 2010; the number of deliveries from these pregnancies; the number of women who underwent pregnancy termination; the number of women who had miscarriages; the total number of women with HIV attending the centre; and the age range of the patients.Results: A total of 6 of 7 major HIV centres agreed to participate. The birth rate among women with HIV (aged 20-39) was found to be 2.4/100 person years (PY). The overall birth rate for women in the same age range in Switzerland was 7.2/100 PY in 2010. In the 20-24 age range, the birth rate was 0.0/100 PY vs. 2.2/100 PY, and in the 25-29 age range, the rate was 3.5/100 PY vs. 11.4/100 PY. There was no difference in the 30-34 and 35-39 age ranges. For women with HIV in the 20-29 age range, a 2.5 fold increase in the overall birth rate was observed, from 2009-2010 to 2010-2011.Conclusions: Although the birth rate was still lower among women with HIV in the 20-29 age range, this finding does demonstrate a clear upward trend over a 2-year period. As a result of these findings, it seems appropriate to provide additional support to women with HIV who want to start a family. In particular, the role of a psychotherapist might be important for some women. Furthermore, healthcare providers must ensure that women with HIV receive contraceptive counselling, even if they wish to become pregnant in the future.\n\n# Background\nIn the last 20 years, significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV, due in part to the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Today, the life expectancy of a young person who receives antiretroviral treatment is nearly identical to that of the HIVnegative population. As a result, women with HIV live longer and may therefore reach childbearing age.\n    Target answer: Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

However, the prevalence of HIV among Swiss women with live births is unknown. This study used a decision tree approach to estimate the prevalence of HIV among Swiss women with live births in 2020. Methods: Data was collected from several sources. The prevalence of HIV among women of childbearing age (15-49 years) in Switzerland was extracted from UNAIDS (2020). The prevalence of HIV among women from 20 sub-Saharan African countries, representing 98.7% of all HIV-positive migrants in Switzerland, was extracted from the literature. The proportion of women of childbearing age who were Swiss and the proportion of HIV-positive migrants who originated from the selected sub-Saharan countries was extracted from Swiss Statistics. The number of live births among Swiss women and HIVpositive migrant women, and the number of women of childbearing age, was extracted from Swiss Statistics (2020) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, respectively. The estimated number of HIV-positive Swiss women was obtained by applying the UNAIDS prevalence estimate of 0.2% to the number of Swiss women of childbearing age. We calculated the number of HIV-positive migrants by applying the prevalence estimate for the sub-Saharan country of origin to the number of migrants in Switzerland. The final estimate for the prevalence of HIV among women of childbearing age was obtained by combining the number of HIV-positive Swiss women and HIV-positive migrant women. The decision tree used for the calculation is presented in a flow chart. Results: We estimated that there were 40 (95% CI: 33, 48) HIV-positive Swiss women and 2,000 (95% CI: 1,250, 2,750) HIV-positive migrant women of childbearing age in Switzerland. The estimated prevalence of HIV among women of childbearing age was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2, 0.5). We estimated that 29 (95% CI: 15, 43) HIVpositive Swiss women and 80 (95% CI: 50, 110) HIV-positive migrant women gave birth in 2020. The estimated prevalence of HIV among women who gave birth in 2020 was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3, 0.7).Conclusions: The prevalence\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

According to the SFOPH (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health), about 2/3 of all infections happen through heterosexual contacts, and 1/3 through men having sex with men (MSM).\nSo, it would be a reasonable answer to say that \u201cheterosexual sex\u201d is the most common way people get infected.\nThe other way is to look at the \u201csource of infection\u201d, which is a more complex concept. The source of infection is the population segment, where the person who infects another person, acquired the infection himself.\nThis is a bit more complicated, because to understand this concept, you have to realize that HIV is concentrated in certain sub-populations, like MSM or people who inject drugs.\nSo, when someone gets infected through heterosexual contacts, for example, there is a high probability that this person actually got infected through sex with an HIV-positive MSM person, who has been infected through sex with another HIV-positive MSM person.\nSo, the source of infection would in fact be MSM, although the person got infected through a heterosexual contact.\nThis question is very important, because the prevention strategies should be focused on these sub-populations, where the infection rates are high.\nFor example, in Switzerland, the new HIV infections in the sub-population of MSM are about 2-3 per 1000. This is about 30 times higher than the average incidence in the general population (0.06 per 1000). So, it is very important to provide effective prevention strategies to this sub-population.\nThe authors of this study wanted to look at the \u201csource of infection\u201d, so they did some complicated modelling to try to reconstruct where the infection came from.\nThe study looked at more than 1000 HIV infections in Switzerland during 2013, and found that 82% of all HIV infections could be attributed to MSM, 9% to PWID (persons who inject drugs), 2% to heterosexual contact and 7% to unknown exposure categories.\nAs the authors say, MSM are \u201cthe predominant source of HIV infection in Switzerland\u201d:\nMSM are the predominant source of HIV infection\n    Target answer: The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use.\n    Background Question: What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

It is the beginning of March and we already have more COVID-19 patients than we can handle. I know it sounds like a bad joke, but that's what we have to deal with now. We do our best in an overwhelmed health system. In a few weeks, my service will rotate to the ward in which all the HIV patients from the surrounding area will be admitted, but now my fear has another name: COVID-19.\nI started my Internal Medicine residency last year in a teaching hospital that had an outpatient clinic specialized in the care of PLWH. During my time on the HIV ward I had the opportunity to get to know my HIV-positive patients in a setting very different from the inpatient ward. At the beginning of this year, I attended a training organized by the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) for young doctors interested in HIV. We had the opportunity to present the work we had done and to discuss them with each other.\nA week later, I travelled to Zurich with two colleagues to the National Center for HIV Education in order to give a workshop about HIV to 4th year medical students. We used this occasion to prepare ourselves for our future work as young doctors with HIVpositive patients. The topic of my workshop was stigma. This topic has occupied me for some time, especially after reading this quote: \"If we think about it at all, we tend to think of stigma as a problem only for those afflicted by it, as if the stain of stigma were itself a kind of disability.\" 1 I started to read everything I could about stigma and HIV, and then I realized that I did not know the answers to the following questions: Is there HIVrelated stigma among HIV-positive patients in Switzerland? What is the extent of this stigma? Is there any recent data on stigma among Swiss PLWH?\nThe only data on stigma that I found was a study on the quality of life of HIV-positive patients from 2008 in which the participants were asked: \"How often do you feel guilty because you have HIV?\" 2 I found this question interesting, but also confusing. Guilt is a strong emotion and it is hard to understand why an HIV-positive person would feel guilty. However, at the beginning of March, with the COVID-19 outbreak, I finally understood that feeling.\nI realized that stigma is not just an obstacle to a good quality of life for HIV-positive patients.

As a result, the time for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 is often unknown. Methods. A literature review on studies related to HIV and AIDS was conducted. Results. A total of 8 studies were considered. Five of them investigated the relationship between the age at diagnosis and the time for CD4 cell count to drop below 200. Two studies found that the CD4 count of PWH dropped below 200 faster when they were diagnosed at older age. A third study concluded that the time for CD4 to drop below 200 was longer if PWH were diagnosed after the age of 20. The last two studies found no correlation between the age at diagnosis and the time for CD4 count to drop below 200. Three other studies did not investigate the time for CD4 cell count to drop below 200 in people diagnosed at older age. The first study found that the time for CD4 count to drop below 200 was shorter when PWH were diagnosed at younger age. The second study found no correlation between age and progression of CD4 decline. The third study found that the age at diagnosis had no effect on the slope of CD4 decline. Conclusion. There was no evidence that PWH diagnosed after the age of 20 will have a longer or shorter time for CD4 cell count to drop below 200 than those tested before the age of 20. More studies should be conducted in this area.\n\n# Introduction\nIn Switzerland, 27% of HIV tests were positive in 2005. Among them, 63% had their first positive test after the age of 20. As a result, the time between HIV infection and the first positive HIV test is often unknown. The 2010 Antiretroviral Treatment of Adult HIV Infection Guidelines [bib_ref] Antiretroviral treatment of adult HIV infection, Thompson [/bib_ref] recommend antiretroviral therapy for people with a CD4 cell count below 350. However, 60% of HIV infected individuals in Switzerland had a CD4 cell count below 350 at the first positive HIV test. Therefore, it is important to estimate the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 from the time of infection.\nSeveral factors may influence the time taken for CD4 cell count to drop below 200. One of the factors is the age at which people with HIV (PWH) are diagnosed with HIV. The\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
