A recent publication from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [2] highlights the importance of global risk assessment and treatment of CV risk factors, as a potential approach to CVD prevention. In general, CV risk assessment is particularly important in patients with low or intermediate CV risk, whereas CV risk factors tend to be managed even without risk estimation in patients with overt disease or high-risk conditions. The same principle also applies to HIV-infected patients and all patients in general. In this way, clinicians will have the opportunity to detect patients with high CV risk, which might not be obvious just by their clinical and demographic characteristics. The rationale for global CV risk assessment of HIV-infected patients is even stronger, since the prevalence of undiagnosed CVD is very high in the general population, and the number of CV risk factors, such as family history of premature CV disease, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which are not included in the majority of risk assessment scores, is even higher in the HIV-infected population [2].\nIn the era of effective ART, the prognosis of HIV-infected patients is not only determined by their virological status and CD4 cell count, but by the presence of comorbidities as well. These patients are more prone to developing metabolic syndrome and other comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, CVD and cancer. Therefore, a comprehensive CV risk assessment of HIV-infected patients will lead to a better management of CV risk factors and consequently, to a better outcome.\nThe most commonly used CV risk scores for general population are the SCORE and the Framingham risk scores (FRS) for low and high risk populations, respectively [2]. Despite the fact that both of these scores overestimate the risk in populations with low CV risk and underestimate the risk in high-risk populations, they are still considered as the reference tools for global risk assessment. Several studies have investigated the performance of FRS and SCORE in HIV-infected patients [\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

I've also been told that an HIV-positive person can't transmit the disease if their viral load is undetectable. Is it true? If so, should I give the medication to the one whose viral load is undetectable?\nIf you have been told that a person with an undetectable viral load cannot transmit HIV, then the person you have been talking to is misinformed. Viral load refers to the amount of HIV RNA present in a sample of blood. When a viral load test says that a patient's viral load is \"undetectable,\" it does not mean that there are no copies of HIV present in the patient's blood; it only means that the test was unable to detect the amount of HIV RNA present in the blood sample. So while having an undetectable viral load means that the patient is responding well to treatment, it does not mean that they are cured of HIV. Additionally, there have been several documented cases of HIV transmission from patients with undetectable viral loads. You should consult with an HIV specialist for further information. Regarding who should receive antiretrovirals, the first patient to be initiated should be the one who is most in need of treatment. The WHO guidelines recommend that patients with AIDS-defining illnesses (such as recurrent bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, or Kaposi's sarcoma) should receive treatment first. Additionally, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers should receive priority treatment, as should patients who are at risk of transmitting HIV to others (such as through sexual contact).\n    Target answer: The information provided is not enough to make a decision.

In other words, do they get infected more often than whites, for example, because of some genetic characteristic that makes blacks more likely to catch the virus, or do they get infected more often because of something else \u2014 because they have fewer resources, for example, and are therefore more likely to be exposed to the virus in the first place?\nA paper published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine offers a provocative new take on that question. Researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at 13 studies of HIV-infected patients, most in the U.S., that measured how much virus each patient was carrying in his or her blood. Viral load \u2014 as the measure is called \u2014 is a sign of how well a person\u2019s body is fighting HIV infection; a high viral load means a person is more infectious. The studies also measured the percentage of immune cells, called CD4 cells, that were not infected with HIV. The researchers found that blacks had, on average, viral loads that were 1.4 times as high as whites; Latinos\u2019 viral loads were 1.3 times as high.\nIf that finding were due to some genetic susceptibility, it would suggest that blacks and Latinos are more vulnerable to HIV and thus should get more sick. But the researchers found the opposite. Blacks, for example, got sick at the same rate as whites, despite carrying more virus. The researchers looked at rates of opportunistic infections \u2014 such as tuberculosis \u2014 and at death rates. They found no significant difference between the races.\n\u201cBlacks and Latinos are not more susceptible to HIV, but they are more likely to be exposed to HIV,\u201d says David Malebranche, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThere are some factors that need to be looked at more closely, such as access to care, and how much time people spend in incarceration, which increases risk of exposure.\u201d (see Time.com\u2019s \u201cSexual Behavior in America\u201d)\nThe study is important not just because it suggests that blacks and Latinos may not be more vulnerable to HIV, but also because it could offer some insight into the question of why blacks and Latinos have such high rates of HIV. In 2006, blacks accounted for 49% of all new HIV cases in the U.S., even though they represent only 13% of the population. Latinos are 15% of the population\n    Target answer: No, ethnicity is not considered a risk factor to get infected with HIV.\n    Background Question: Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

These include:\n\n- **Erythema migrans rash**: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area.\n- **Fatigue**: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days.\n- **Muscle and joint aches**: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness.\n- **Fever**: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills.\n- **Palpitations and dizziness**: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement.\n\nThe patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. He has no known history of STIs, is not on any current medications, and is not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and recent hiking trip in an endemic area, Lyme disease is a primary consideration. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*. The erythema migrans rash is a characteristic symptom of early Lyme disease, often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and muscle and joint aches.\n\nThe patient's recent high-risk sexual activity also raises concerns for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the symptoms presented are more indicative of Lyme disease than other STIs.\n\n**Diagnostic Testing**\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, the following tests should be ordered:\n\n- **ELISA test for Lyme antibodies**: This test detects the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the causative agent of Lyme disease.\n- **Western blot test for Lyme disease**: This test is used to confirm the results of the ELISA test and to rule out false positives.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\nWhile the patient's symptoms are suggestive of Lyme disease, it is essential to consider\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area.

What is the most appropriate management option in this scenario? Drug-drug interactions between ART medications and phenytoin (PHT) are well documented and are mainly caused by enzyme induction of cytochrome P450 3A4. Therefore, a patient on TAF/FTC/BIC who is also taking PHT is at risk of suboptimal ARV drug levels. This can happen because PHT can significantly increase the metabolism of bictegravir (BIC) by enzyme induction. Therefore, this patient is at risk of suboptimal BIC drug levels. This means that the patient should be monitored for virologic failure. 2. Based on the information that was just presented, one should consider replacing BIC with DTG as the integrase inhibitor in the regimen. DTG does not use the CYP450 pathway and is not significantly affected by the concomitant use of PHT. Another option would be to replace the integrase inhibitor with a boosted PI, since it has been proven that PI and DTG levels are less affected by PHT. 3. In this scenario, the patient should not be switched from TAF to TDF. Although TAF is a substrate of UGT1A1 and PHT can induce its metabolism, TAF can still be safely used in this scenario.\n    Target answer: Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

The risk of resistance is reduced if the partner\u2019s viral load is under 200 c/ml.\n- The viral load of the partner is unknown, which makes the situation more difficult.\n    Target answer: XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen.
