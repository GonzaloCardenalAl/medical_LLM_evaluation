(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: **Answer:**\nB. Denaturation of proteins\n\n**Explanation:**\nAnswer: B Denaturation of proteins Vitamin C inactivates upon prolonged heating. This occurs through oxidation and subsequent breakdown to diketogulonic acid. The vitamin is sensitive to heat and its absorption also depends on dietary intake and the bioavailability of the vitamin in the diet. Vitamin C deficiency can occur if the diet does not provide enough vitamin C or absorption is impaired. This can happen if foods containing vitamin C are boiled and the heat-sensitive vitamin is destroyed. Scurvy is the clinical condition of a vitamin C deficiency. Heat denaturation is a process where the protein loses its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure but retains its primary structure. Denatured proteins lose their biological activity and their function. This occurs because hydrogen bonds between the backbone amino acids or salt bridges between the amino acids in the interior of the protein break. A reduction in hydrophobic interactions can also cause denaturation. Answer: C Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) This is the clinical condition of a vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency can occur if the diet does not provide enough vitamin C or absorption is impaired. This can happen if foods containing vitamin C are boiled and the heat-sensitive vitamin is destroyed. Scurvy occurs within 1-3 months of a diet without vitamin C. Typical signs of scurvy include bleeding gums, poor wound healing, fatigue, and irritability. Vitamin C is required for hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues in the formation of collagen. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine requires vitamin C as a cofactor. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are crucial for the proper folding and formation of a triple helix. Vitamin C deficiency can be diagnosed by measurement of plasma and white blood cell vitamin C concentration. Answer: D Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) This is the clinical condition of a vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency can occur if the diet does not provide enough vitamin C or absorption is impaired. This can happen if foods containing vitamin C are boiled and the heat-sensitive vitamin is destroyed. Scurvy occurs within 1-3 months of a diet without vitamin C. Typical signs of scurvy include bleeding gums, poor wound healing, fatigue, and irritability. Vitamin C is required for hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues in the formation of collagen. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine requires vitamin C as a cofactor\n    Target answer: If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired.\n    Background Question: A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) belongs to a genus of retroviruses known as lentiviruses. There are two distinct types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the most common type and has a worldwide distribution, while HIV-2 is largely found in Western Africa. After entering the body, the virus infects and destroys the CD4 cells, leading to a decrease in the body's ability to fight infections. As the disease progresses, HIV destroys more CD4 cells, thus increasing the risk of developing opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and tumors. The patient in the vignette was diagnosed with HIV. Since she did not consistently use condoms, she was at high risk for acquiring sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. She was treated with zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. Didanosine is one of the most common causes of drug-induced pancreatitis. If the patient has a history of pancreatitis, didanosine should be discontinued and replaced with tenofovir. Tenofovir is one of the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used in combination therapy to treat HIV. However, the patient in the vignette was already being treated with zidovudine, which belongs to the same class of drugs (NRTIs) and works in a similar manner as tenofovir.\nA 55-year-old male is brought to the emergency department due to an acute deterioration of his level of consciousness. His family reports that he has been suffering from fever and rigors for the last week. He was diagnosed with pneumonia two days ago but was not hospitalized. He also complains of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination, his temperature is 39.0\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Neurological examination reveals a stupor and an altered mental status. Further evaluation is warranted.\n- What is the next step in the diagnosis of this patient?\n- What is the pathogenesis of the causative agent?\n- What are the treatment options for the infection caused by this pathogen?\nA 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of a recent rash. The rash appeared suddenly and has been spreading for the past two days. He describes the rash as being itchy and red, with blisters forming. The patient states that the blisters are filled with fluid. He has never had a rash like this before. The patient also complains of a fever and body aches. He takes no\n    Target answer: After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

The envelope is responsible for the attachment and entry of the virus into the host cell. The major envelope proteins are:\n\n*   **gp120**: A glycoprotein that binds to the CD4 receptor on the host cell surface.\n*   **gp41**: A glycoprotein that facilitates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n*   **gp160**: A precursor protein that is cleaved to form gp120 and gp41.\n\n**Testing for Antibodies**\n\nTo test for the presence of an antibody against the HIV envelope proteins, a recombinant form of the protein is used. Recombinant proteins are produced using genetic engineering techniques and are identical to the natural protein.\n\n**Target of the Antibody**\n\nThe physician scientist is designing an antibody against the HIV envelope proteins. The gp160 protein is the precursor to gp120 and gp41, but it is not the primary target of the natural humoral immune response. The gp120 and gp41 proteins are the primary targets of the natural immune response and are therefore the most likely targets of the antibody being designed.\n\n**Testing for the Antibody**\n\nTo test for the presence of the antibody in the patient's serum, the recombinant gp160 protein is used. This is because the gp160 protein contains both the gp120 and gp41 regions, allowing for the detection of antibodies against both proteins.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most likely target of the antibody being designed is the gp120 protein, and the protein that should be used to test for its presence in the patient's serum is the recombinant gp160 protein.\n\n### Answer:\ngp160 protein\n    Target answer: The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120.\n    Background Question: A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response.

It is important to establish the effect of overexpression and/or knockdown of individual microRNAs on HIV replication and latency. 5) Would the use of microRNA expression as a marker of disease progression be useful in patients with HIV infection? The use of microRNAs expression as a marker of HIV disease progression could be useful. 6) What would be the ideal microRNA as a therapeutic target? The ideal microRNA for therapeutic targeting would have a broad antiviral effect against HIV in a range of cell types, such as T cells, macrophages, and DCs. Moreover, the targeted microRNA would ideally have a beneficial role in the host cell and no off-target effects. 7) Would a microRNA mimic be the best approach to deliver miRNAs into the infected cell? Yes, the use of microRNA mimics is the best approach to deliver miRNAs into the infected cell. 8) How can the host be protected against the toxic effect of miRNA antagonists? To protect the host against the toxic effects of miRNA antagonists, they should be specifically delivered to HIV-infected cells. 9) What is the appropriate method to assess the anti-HIV effect of microRNA antagonists in vitro? The anti-HIV effect of microRNA antagonists in vitro can be assessed by measuring the effect of miRNA on the level of HIV replication. 10) Which animal models should be used to assess the therapeutic potential of microRNAs against HIV? Humanized mouse models should be used to assess the therapeutic potential of microRNAs against HIV.

Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections .\n    Background Question:  What would be the best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

HIV-1 infection, as well as several other viral infections, is associated with increased methylation of viral promoters. However, there is little information about the effects of HIV-1 infection on DNA methylation levels of host genes, and there are no reports in the literature of studies comparing DNA methylation levels in latent HIV-1-infected patients with those in patients with active infection.Methods: The PRISMA-P method was used to perform a systematic review of studies investigating DNA methylation profiles in HIV-1-infected patients. A search was carried out using the PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases. The keywords were: HIV-1 AND (DNA methylation OR epigenetic).Results: Thirty-one articles were found, all of them were published in English. We identified only one study that investigated HIV-1 latently-infected patients and no study compared the methylation profile in latentlyinfected patients and those with an active HIV-1 infection.Conclusions: There is a lack of information on DNA methylation levels in patients with HIV-1 latent infection. Our data suggest the need for studies comparing HIV-1 latently-infected patients and those with active infection, to provide a better understanding of the role of DNA methylation in the maintenance of the latent HIV-1 infection, which may lead to more effective treatment for AIDS.\n\n# Background\nEpigenetic modifications are defined as heritable changes in gene expression that are not associated with changes in DNA sequence. DNA methylation, the most studied epigenetic modification, occurs when a methyl group is added to the 5\u2032-position of cytosine residues in cytosinephosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides. This epigenetic modification is catalysed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and generally involves promoter regions and CpG islands, which are gene-rich regions of DNA consisting of a high concentration of CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is involved in the maintenance of genome stability and normal development. DNA methylation of gene promoter regions typically leads to transcriptional repression of that gene [bib_ref] Genome-wide methylation profiling in Deciphering Epigenetics, Tserel [/bib_ref].
