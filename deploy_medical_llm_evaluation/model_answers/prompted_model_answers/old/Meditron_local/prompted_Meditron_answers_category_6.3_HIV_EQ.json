Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Encephalitis\n### Answer:\nB. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)Explanation:\nThis patient has a disseminated brain process affecting primarily white matter, with a subacute onset and progressive course. The patient's immune status and HIV infection suggest an infectious etiology. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a white matter demyelinating disease caused by JC virus, a polyoma virus. It primarily affects immunosuppressed patients, with a 60% to 80% prevalence in HIV/AIDS patients. MRI shows nonenhancing white matter lesions. HIV-1 enters the brain and causes HIV dementia, or HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits, apathy, and social withdrawal. The most common MRI findings are atrophy and diffuse white matter hyperintensity. Toxoplasma encephalitis is the most common brain infection in HIV-infected patients and typically presents with headache, fever, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. CT/MRI usually shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. CMV encephalitis is less common and is characterized by rapid cognitive decline and diffuse abnormalities on MRI, although focal lesions are possible.\n Answer: B\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases.

The following tests are typically done:\n\n### Blood Type and Antibody Screening\n- Determine the patient's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh status.\n- Screen for antibodies against the Rh antigen if the patient is Rh-negative. This helps identify potential issues with Rh incompatibility.\n\n### Serological Testing for Syphilis\n- Screen for syphilis using a serological test. This is done to detect active or past infection, which can affect the pregnancy.\n\n### Urinalysis\n- Perform a urinalysis to check for protein, glucose, and signs of infection.\n\n### Hemoglobin or Hematocrit\n- Check the patient's hemoglobin or hematocrit levels to detect anemia.\n\n### Rubella Susceptibility Status\n- Determine the patient's rubella susceptibility status. This is done to assess the risk of congenital rubella syndrome.\n\n### Hepatitis B Surface Antigen\n- Screen for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to detect hepatitis B infection.\n\n### Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n- Screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n### Chlamydia trachomatis\n- Screen for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, which can affect the pregnancy and the baby's health.\n\n### Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n- Screen for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, which can also affect the pregnancy and the baby's health.\n\n### Cervical Cytology\n- Perform a Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.\n\n### Testing Not Recommended\n- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG and IgM serology**: CMV is a common viral infection that can cause congenital CMV infection in newborns. However, testing for CMV during pregnancy is not recommended due to the low prevalence of primary CMV infection during pregnancy (less than 2% of pregnant women). Additionally, there is no proven intervention for preventing maternal-to-fetal transmission of CMV, making routine testing unnecessary.\n\n### Answer:\nThe patient should NOT be tested for cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG and IgM serology.\n    Target answer: Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years.

TMP/SMX\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis patient has AIDS (HIV with CD4+ count less than 200/mm3), a fever, and multiple papules that are vascular. The differential diagnosis includes bacillary angiomatosis (BA), disseminated histoplasmosis (DH), and Kaposi sarcoma (KS). BA is a disease seen in HIV patients with CD4+ counts less than 200/mm3. It presents with multiple vascular papules, which are seen here. It is caused by infection by Bartonella spp., usually B. henselae, a Gram-negative bacterium. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by biopsy showing clusters of blood vessels and microorganisms. The biopsy in this patient showed small black bacteria, which are typical of BA and DH. DH also is seen in HIV with CD4+ counts less than 100/mm3 and can present with skin lesions. However, disseminated histoplasmosis is a fungal infection, and the biopsy would show oval budding yeast cells. KS also is seen in patients with AIDS and presents with multiple red papules or plaques. However, in contrast to the other 2 diseases, KS does not have bacteria on biopsy; it is seen in patients with AIDS who are co-infected with Kaposi sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KS is more common in homosexual men, whereas BA is more common in injection drug users.\n\n### Treatment of Bartonella spp.\nErythromycin and doxycycline are drugs used to treat Bartonella spp. However, erythromycin is a macrolide that is associated with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and thus is not safe to use in patients who are being treated with multiple drugs that can also cause QT prolongation (i.e., protease inhibitors). Doxycycline is also contraindicated in pregnant women. Fluoroquinolones and azithromycin are safe alternatives. However, fluoroquinolones are not recommended for use in patients with mycobacterial infections because they are not bactericidal for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see Chapter 8). Rifampin, a first-line antituberculous drug, cannot be used to treat Bartonella spp. infections because it induces the cytochrome P450 system, which decreases the efficacy of the protease inhibitors. Rifabutin is a much weaker inducer of the cyto\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

The MRI images of primary CNS lymphoma show irregular ring-enhancing lesions, typically with periventricular and deep white matter involvement. This type of lymphoma has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In this case, the patient has HIV, which can lead to a diminished immune system. The slight pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the MRI findings, and the PCR positivity for Epstein-Barr virus DNA all support a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.

Factors including the timing of maternal HIV diagnosis, the timing and type of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, the HIV viral load at the time of delivery, mode of delivery, and the timing of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis initiation should be considered when selecting a postpartum regimen. In the case of this newborn, the mother had received ART, and the viral load was low at the time of delivery. Therefore, the risk for HIV transmission is low. Thus, this infant is a candidate for short-term postpartum zidovudine prophylaxis. The risk for infant exposure to HIV is low, but not negligible. Short-term postpartum prophylaxis (such as zidovudine prophylaxis) can be provided for the newborn with low risk exposure. A post-exposure prophylaxis regimen including zidovudine and nevirapine can be provided for newborns with high risk exposure. For newborns with medium risk exposure, zidovudine prophylaxis combined with three doses of nevirapine can be administered. IVIG therapy is not recommended for prophylaxis. Lamivudine is not recommended for newborn prophylaxis.\n\n### Answer:\nA. Zidovudine prophylaxis for at least 6 weeks\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
