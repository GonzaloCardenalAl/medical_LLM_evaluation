These findings raise concern for an opportunistic CNS infection. Because the patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F, it is possible he is experiencing an acute cerebral abscess. The next step in management should be to perform a CT scan of the head with contrast. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated in this clinical setting, and the appropriate empiric agent would be intravenous amphotericin B. In patients with HIV, cerebral abscesses are most commonly caused by Aspergillus species. The other answer choices are not correct. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in this case due to concern for cerebral mass lesions. Discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide and pravastatin will not address the patient's neurological deficit. Changing the patient's itraconazole to fluconazole is not appropriate since Aspergillus spp. do not respond to fluconazole therapy. Finally, while repeating CD4 testing may be helpful, it does not directly address the patient's acute neurological deficit.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a vasoproliferative disease in which bacteria cause the proliferation of capillaries, leading to the formation of angiomatous skin lesions. These lesions are usually purple papules that may resemble Kaposi sarcoma. Although this condition is also seen in AIDS patients, it is associated with Bartonella henselae, which is the same bacteria that causes Cat Scratch disease. Patients with cat scratch disease usually have a history of contact with cats, which is usually a kitten less than 1 year old. This disease should be considered in immunocompromised patients with skin lesions. If cat scratch disease is suspected, Bartonella henselae is the primary causative organism, and treatment should be with a macrolide antibiotic or a tetracycline. For the treatment of bacillary angiomatosis, the drug of choice is Erythromycin or Doxycycline. Treatment should continue for at least 3 months. **Anti-fungal therapy**   The most common opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients is candida albicans. Candida may affect the mouth (oral thrush), the esophagus, and the vagina. This patient has evidence of oral candidiasis, which is a white patchy rash that is characteristic. Candidiasis occurs more frequently with severe immunodeficiency and is usually a presenting manifestation of AIDS. Candida thrives in an environment of low pH, such as the mouth, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, candidiasis in the oral cavity is characterized by painless white patches on the buccal mucosa that can be scraped off, leaving an erythematous, eroded base. Oral thrush is treated with topical agents, such as clotrimazole troche or oral fluconazole. Esophageal candidiasis should be treated with systemic fluconazole or another antifungal agent. It can lead to esophageal strictures and perforation. Candida infection in the vagina is common in HIV-positive women. The patient presents with pruritus, vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Treatment is with either a single dose of oral fluconazole or topical antifungal agents, such as miconazole or clotrimazole. Fluconazole-resistant candida infections are an increasing concern in immunocomprom\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

He has a history of HIV diagnosed 14 years ago and has been inconsistently taking his antiretroviral medications. His current medication regimen includes antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination reveals ataxia and apathy, and his Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL) and slight pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid analysis with positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA on PCR. MRI of the brain with contrast reveals a solitary ring-enhancing lesion measuring 4.5 cm in diameter involving the corpus callosum.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, several differential diagnoses should be considered:\n\n1. **Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL):**\n - PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.\n - The patient's HIV status, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid strongly support this diagnosis.\n - PCNSL typically presents with ring-enhancing lesions on imaging, which is consistent with the MRI findings in this patient.\n - The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid further supports the diagnosis of PCNSL.\n\n2. **Glioblastoma:**\n - Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor that can present with ring-enhancing lesions on imaging.\n - However, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid and the patient's HIV status make glioblastoma less likely in this case.\n\n3. **Toxoplasmosis:**\n - Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n - It can present with ring-enhancing lesions on imaging, but the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid makes toxoplasmosis less likely.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the patient's HIV status, low CD4+\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

Because this patient's mother has a viral load of 678 copies/mL, she would not be suitable for nevirapine therapy. The next step in management is to initiate a two-drug regimen with zidovudine and lamivudine, as nevirapine is only recommended for those with viral loads below 20 copies/mL.\nIt is essential to ensure that the mother is receiving proper antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV transmission to the infant. The infant should also be evaluated for HIV infection with a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing.\nIn the absence of nevirapine, the infant should be given zidovudine and lamivudine for 6 weeks. The dosage for each medication should be adjusted based on the infant's weight and age.\nClose follow-up and monitoring of the infant's HIV status are crucial to ensure timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment if necessary.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
