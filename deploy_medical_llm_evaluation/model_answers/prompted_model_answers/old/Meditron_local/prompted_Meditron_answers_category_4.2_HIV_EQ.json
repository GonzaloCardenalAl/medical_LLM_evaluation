It is calculated using the following formula:\n\nNPV = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives)\n\nIn this scenario, we have the following data:\n\n- **True Negatives:** The number of patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. This is given as 245 patients.\n- **False Negatives:** The number of patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. This is given as 10 patients.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the NPV as follows:\n\nNPV = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives)\n= 245 / (245 + 10)\n= 245 / 255\n= 0.96\n\nHowever, none of the options match this result. This is because the calculation is slightly different when considering the total number of patients tested, which is 500.\n\nNPV = (true negatives) / (total number of patients tested)\n= 245 / 500\n= 0.49\n\nHowever, this calculation does not accurately reflect the true negative rate. A more accurate calculation would be to use the formula:\n\nNPV = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives + false positives)\n= 245 / (245 + 10 + 5)\n= 245 / 260\n= 0.9423\n\nHowever, even this calculation does not match the options provided.\n\n**Answer:**\nB) 0.98\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

Perform a lumbar puncture to diagnose and treat bacterial meningitis. The patient's history of HIV infection and prior hospitalization for pneumonia along with his high-grade fever and neurological deficit suggest the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is indicated in this case to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes. Ruling out HIV-related causes of meningitis includes performing a lumbar puncture with CSF studies and CSF culture. The CSF studies to perform include cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, bacterial culture, fungal culture, cryptococcal antigen, and VDRL. The patient should receive empiric antibiotic therapy for bacterial meningitis, but he should also receive empiric treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans. While a brain MRI may be indicated to investigate alternative diagnoses, it should not delay antibiotic treatment. It is not necessary to draw blood cultures or obtain a chest X-ray. In addition, starting a sulfonylurea to manage his diabetes should not delay empiric antibiotic therapy. References: 1. Heffner AC, Horton JM, Jaffe DM. Emergencies after hours: bacterial meningitis.

It is characterized by a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and processing speed.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Risk Factors**: HAD is more common in individuals with advanced HIV infection, those who are non-compliant with antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those with a history of opportunistic infections.\n- **Symptoms**: HAD typically presents with a gradual decline in cognitive function, including:\n  - Memory loss\n  - Difficulty with concentration and attention\n  - Slowed processing speed\n  - Difficulty with executive function (e.g., planning, decision-making)\n  - Mood changes (e.g., depression, apathy)\n- **Physical Examination**: The physical examination may be normal, or it may reveal signs of neurological impairment, such as:\n  - Cognitive impairment\n  - Focal neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, numbness)\n  - Seizures\n  - Ataxia (loss of coordination)\n- **Diagnostic Criteria**: HAD is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The diagnosis is supported by:\n  - A significant decline in cognitive function\n  - The presence of HIV infection\n  - Exclusion of other causes of cognitive impairment (e.g., opportunistic infections, substance use disorders)\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**\n\nThe differential diagnosis for HAD includes other causes of cognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals, such as:\n\n- **Toxoplasmosis**: A parasitic infection that can cause focal neurological deficits and seizures.\n- **Cryptococcal meningitis**: A fungal infection that can cause fever, headache, and neurological deficits.\n- **Substance use disorders**: Can cause cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms.\n- **Hepatitis C infection**: Can cause cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms.\n\n### Answer:\nA. HIV-associated dementia\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathyD. HIV encephalopathyE. Tuberculoma\n**Toxoplasmosis Overview**\n\nToxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii. The infection can be acquired in two main ways:\n\n- **Ingestion of oocysts**: Contaminated food and water can contain oocysts, which are then ingested by the host.\n- **Vertical transmission**: Pregnant women can pass the infection to their fetus, leading to congenital toxoplasmosis.\n\n**Clinical Features and Diagnosis**\n\nIn the general population, toxoplasmosis is typically asymptomatic, but in immunocompromised individuals, it can lead to serious complications. The patient in the scenario has HIV, making him immunocompromised. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can be challenging, but it is often suspected in patients with a history of HIV infection, especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**\n\n- **Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)**: This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain. However, it typically presents with a more diffuse, multifocal involvement, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis would not typically show Epstein-Barr virus DNA.\n- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: This is a viral infection caused by the JC virus, which affects the white matter of the brain. However, PML typically presents with more widespread demyelination and would not typically show a solitary ring-enhancing lesion.\n- **HIV encephalopathy**: This is a direct effect of HIV infection on the brain, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. However, it does not typically present with a solitary ring-enhancing lesion.\n- **Tuberculoma**: This is a manifestation of tuberculosis in the brain, which can present with ring-enhancing lesions. However, it is less common in HIV patients compared to toxoplasmosis, and the patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nToxoplasmosis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, given his immunocompromised status, the solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, and the presence of Toxop\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

Since the scores of this infant are normal, he does not require immediate resuscitation. The infant should have his first bath deferred for 24 hours because the vernix caseosa provides natural protection against skin pathogens and should be left intact until the first bath. Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) suctioning of the infant is not indicated unless there is obvious nasal or oral blockage. Since there is no mention of such blockage in the scenario, no suctioning is necessary. The baby should be given vitamin K (VK) 0.5-1 mg intramuscularly (IM) into the vastus lateralis muscle. All infants should receive prophylactic VK as newborns are at risk of developing VK deficiency bleeding (VKDB). VKDB may result in severe intracranial hemorrhage. Infants of mothers with HIV should be treated prophylactically with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. This can be achieved with oral zidovudine for 4-6 weeks. The infant should be evaluated by a pediatric HIV specialist 1-3 weeks after birth and HIV DNA PCR should be checked to determine whether the infant is infected. HIV prophylaxis should be continued in HIV-exposed infants until virologic testing confirms that they are not infected. The pediatric HIV specialist will make further recommendations about ART based on the PCR results.\nProphylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum, also known as neonatal conjunctivitis, is important because this condition may cause permanent blindness. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends prophylaxis with 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment to prevent gonococcal infection. In the United States, the routine use of silver nitrate is no longer recommended due to its low efficacy in preventing gonococcal conjunctivitis and the risk of causing neonatal conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotic prophylaxis does not prevent neonatal conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia.\n\nProphylaxis with vitamin K (VK) is given to all newborns to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. VK is administered as 0.5-1 mg intramuscularly (IM). VK may be given IM at birth or at 6 hours of life. Hemorrhagic disease of\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities.
