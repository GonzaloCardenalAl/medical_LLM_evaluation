But researchers found a way to diagnose HIV, which has been critical in helping stop the spread of AIDS. Here\u2019s how they did it, from the World Health Organization and the CDC:\n1. AIDS cases are reported in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nDoctors first realize that something new and serious is happening in 1981, when they report a series of patients in Los Angeles and San Francisco with a strange combination of infections. Some of these patients have developed a rare kind of cancer. All the patients are gay men.\n2. Scientists start looking for a virus.\nIn the early 1980s, scientists start looking for a virus that might cause these illnesses. In Paris, a French virologist named Dr. Luc Montagnier finds signs of a new retrovirus. He sends samples of his virus to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. American scientist Dr. Robert Gallo grows the virus and tests the blood of AIDS patients to see if they have the new virus. His test is positive.\n3. Researchers start looking for a test.\nThe discovery of the virus is a major breakthrough, but it doesn\u2019t help anyone get treatment. Scientists still don\u2019t know how the virus works or how to stop it. Dr. Gallo and a Japanese scientist, Dr. Kiyoshi Nagai, develop a test that can show if someone\u2019s blood contains the new virus.\n4. The FDA approves the test.\nIn 1985, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the test to screen blood and blood products, which helps protect people who need transfusions. But there\u2019s no cure for HIV. At this point, HIV is fatal for almost all the people who have it. Doctors can treat some of the infections and cancers caused by AIDS, but they can\u2019t stop the virus.\n5. HIV becomes more treatable.\nDoctors are still looking for a cure for HIV. But by the 1990s, they have discovered medicines that can slow down the virus, and can sometimes keep it from ever making someone sick. This makes a huge difference for people who are infected. With early treatment, people with HIV can now live for many years, just like people without HIV.\nSources:\n- CDC: \"The Global HIV/AIDS Pandemic, 2006\"\n- WHO: \"HIV/AIDS Fact Sheet\"\n- WHO: \"HIV/AIDS Fact Sheet: Questions and Answers\"\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

We searched PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE. For each region, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of comorbidities and cardiovascular risk scores for studies of people living with HIV (PLWH) and studies of HIV-uninfected populations. We used the random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled OR of comorbidities among PLWH compared with HIV-uninfected persons.\n\n# Results\nWe included 127 studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis. In high-income regions, the prevalence of comorbidities was consistently higher among PLWH than in HIV-uninfected persons. In low-income and middle-income regions, there were too few studies to establish the magnitude of the difference in the prevalence of comorbidities between PLWH and HIV-uninfected populations. For studies including only men, the pooled prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among PLWH in Europe and North America was 11%-27% for hypertension, 6%-18% for diabetes and 2%-3% for cerebrovascular disease. The pooled prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidaemia was higher among PLWH than in HIV-uninfected populations in all regions, and for studies that included only men (OR 1.31-1.71 for hypertension and 1.18-2.11 for dyslipidaemia).

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: What can I do to keep from getting infected with HIV? There are many things you can do to reduce your chances of getting infected with HIV. If you are sexually active, you should:\n- Practice safe sex by using a condom every time you have sex\n- Find out if your sexual partners have ever been tested for HIV, and ask if their test was negative\n- Avoid sex with people who have other sexual partners\n- Avoid sex with people who use IV drugs\n- Avoid anal sex, especially if you do not use a condom\n- Limit your number of sexual partners\n- Use latex condoms, which are more effective than natural membrane condoms\n\nIf you are a woman having sex with a man, use a vaginal spermicide gel or foam with a condom. Spermicides contain chemicals that kill sperm and some viruses that can cause sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A vaginal spermicide gel or foam used with a condom may provide more protection from HIV infection than a condom alone.\n\nThe only way to avoid exposure to HIV is to avoid risky behaviors completely. If you are in a sexual relationship with one partner and both you and your partner are HIV negative, it is best to remain sexually active only with each other.\n\nCan I get HIV from donating blood?\nNo, you cannot get HIV by donating blood. Blood collection organizations use sterile needles for each donation. They also carefully screen all donated blood for HIV and other blood-borne viruses.\n\nWhat if I am pregnant and have HIV?\nWomen who are pregnant and have HIV need to have extra medical care during their pregnancy. That's because women with HIV can pass the infection on to their babies before, during, or after delivery.\n\nWhen HIV-positive women take certain HIV medicines during pregnancy, the chance of their baby being infected with HIV is very low. That's why women who are pregnant and who think they might have been exposed to HIV need to get tested and treated as early as possible.\n\nIf you are pregnant and know you have HIV, make sure your doctors know so that they can give you and your baby the right treatment. If you think you have been exposed to HIV or have any symptoms of HIV, tell your doctor or nurse right away. You should also tell him or her if your partner or someone you have sex with has HIV.\n\nIs there a vaccine to prevent HIV?\nNot yet. Scientists are still working to develop a vaccine. But researchers are making progress in the effort to develop one.\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Do the medications interact with each other or other prescribed medications? What if a dose is forgotten?\n- Drug treatment for depression is effective. However, some patients are resistant to pharmacological intervention and may need to be considered for electroconvulsive therapy. ECT can be administered in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It is especially helpful in patients with a history of prior positive response to ECT or who have medical or psychiatric contraindications to pharmacological treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy is typically used when all other treatment options have been exhausted or have failed.\n- Although depression does not cause infertility or premature delivery, patients with depression in pregnancy have a 60% chance of relapse in the postpartum period and 25% chance of developing postpartum depression.\n- All psychotropic medications cross the placental barrier. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have the most research data available in pregnancy. SSRIs appear to be relatively safe and the risk of adverse events with exposure to these medications appears to be low. Paroxetine has been associated with fetal cardiac defects and is best avoided in the first trimester.\n- There is limited research available for the newer antidepressant drugs and these should not be used routinely. Although these agents may be efficacious, the lack of substantial human data is a concern for their use in pregnancy. For women who respond to these agents and are stable, switching to a drug that has a more robust safety profile may be difficult.\n- Pregnant women are at risk for experiencing a recurrence of symptoms of depression, particularly if not taking antidepressants. However, psychotropic medications do cross the placenta and there is a risk of fetal exposure to medication, with the potential for adverse events in the fetus or newborn. Untreated maternal depression can have significant adverse effects on the fetus, including preterm birth and low birthweight. Thus, untreated maternal depression may pose a greater risk to the developing fetus than the possible risks associated with exposure to antidepressant medications. Women who are contemplating pregnancy or who are pregnant should be educated about these risks and included in the decision-making process. A comprehensive treatment plan that optimizes maternal health and minimizes fetal risk should be developed.\n- The management of antenatal depression is based on the patient's treatment history, the severity of illness, and current symptoms. For pregnant women with mild to moderate symptoms, psychotherapy may be appropriate as first-line\n    Target answer: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months.\n    Background Question: How frequently ART must be taken?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

It's also unlikely for it to be transmitted through non sexual contact. How does it NOT spread?\nHow is HIV not transmitted? [closed]\nIt's hard to tell why HIV is not transmitted in any given situation; there's so much we don't know. However, we do know why HIV is not transmitted through many routes: It's not transmitted through oral sex because saliva is a very poor medium for HIV. It's not transmitted through kissing or other contact with saliva because the virus doesn't survive very long or travel very far outside of a human body. It's not transmitted through touching or contact with skin because the virus can't live for more than a few minutes on a dry surface. It's not transmitted through sharing food, drinks, or utensils because the virus is very fragile and doesn't survive very well in the environment. It's not transmitted through touching, sharing, or using objects like towels, toilet seats, or doorknobs because the virus doesn't survive for long on dry surfaces. It's not transmitted through mosquito bites or other insect bites because HIV doesn't replicate in insects, and they don't have the same blood and immune systems as humans do. It's not transmitted through swimming pools or hot tubs because the virus doesn't survive well in water. It's not transmitted through casual contact, like hugging, shaking hands, or sitting next to someone who has HIV because the virus doesn't spread through contact with intact skin. It's not transmitted through air, sneezing, or coughing because the virus is not airborne and can't survive very long outside of a human body. It's not transmitted through contact with sweat or tears because the virus doesn't survive very long outside of the body, and there's not enough virus in these fluids to cause infection.\n    Target answer: You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching).

In order to enter the cell, the virus must first attach to a molecule called CD4, located on the surface of the lymphocyte. The CD4 molecule has been found in other immune cells, as well as in various types of body cells. When HIV is close to the immune cell, it attaches to the CD4 molecule through an envelope protein called gp120. This protein allows the virus to enter the cell through a process of fusion, by binding to a second type of receptor, called a co-receptor. Once inside the cell, the HIV uses an enzyme to release its genetic material called RNA into the cell. Another enzyme, called reverse transcriptase, is used to transcribe the viral RNA into DNA, which then becomes part of the host's DNA.\nHIV can also exist in a dormant, or latent, state in some cells. This means that the virus is still present, but it is not replicating. This allows the virus to evade immune response, and remain present without being detected. The factors that determine when the virus will become active are not well understood.\nAnswered By: Judd W. Walson\n    Target answer: The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
