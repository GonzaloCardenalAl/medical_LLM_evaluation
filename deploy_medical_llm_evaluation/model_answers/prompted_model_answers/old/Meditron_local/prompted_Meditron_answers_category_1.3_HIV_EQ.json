If a pregnant woman does not get tested for HIV, she might pass HIV to her baby. If a woman finds out she has HIV while she is pregnant, she can take medicines to prevent passing HIV to her baby.\n\nIf you are pregnant, your doctor or midwife will offer to test you for HIV. This test can show if you have HIV. You will probably also be tested for HIV when you are in labor.\n\nDoctors do not test women for HIV without their permission. But if a woman has a baby with HIV, she will usually be tested for HIV. If a woman is tested for HIV, she will always be told her results.\n\nWhat medicines can I take to prevent passing HIV to my baby?\nIf your HIV test is positive, your doctor or nurse will prescribe a medicine to treat HIV. He or she will also prescribe a medicine for you to take to help keep your baby from getting HIV. If you take these medicines every day as directed, the chances of your baby getting HIV will go down by 90 percent.\n\nWhich medicine will I take?\nYour doctor will prescribe a medicine called \"zidovudine\" (also known as AZT). He or she will give you a special kind of zidovudine called \"oral zidovudine.\" You will take it by mouth, as a pill or syrup. Your doctor might also give you a prescription for other anti-HIV medicines.\n\nWhen should I start taking the medicine?\nYou should start taking the medicine as soon as you find out you have HIV. Even if you find out in the last week of your pregnancy, you should still start taking the medicine. It is never too late to start taking zidovudine and other anti-HIV medicines.\n\nThe amount of zidovudine that you take will depend on your weight. A nurse will teach you how to take your medicine.\n\nWhat will I do in the hospital?\nWhen you are in the hospital to have your baby, you will have to take the medicine by injection. This means that you will get it through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an \"IV.\"\n\nA nurse will give you the medicine as long as you are in the hospital. You will stop taking the medicine once your baby is born. But your baby will also get a dose of zidovudine when he or she is born.\n\nWhen will my baby get medicine?\nYour baby will get a dose of zidovudine right after birth. Then he or she\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

What happens next?\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that can cause a disease called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are 3 stages of HIV infection. In the first 2 to 4 weeks after being infected with the HIV virus, most people have a flu-like illness. This is called the \"acute\" stage of HIV. After the acute stage, people can go months or even years without any symptoms of HIV. This is called the \"latent\" or \"chronic\" stage of HIV. It is only after the latent stage that people develop AIDS.\n\nHow is HIV infection treated?\nTreatment for HIV infection involves taking 2 or more medicines. The medicines you take will depend on:\n- Your health\n- Your age\n- How well your body can handle the medicines\n- Other medicines you are taking\n- How well your medicines are working\n\nIn the early stages of HIV, people often do not take medicines every day. Your doctor will tell you when to start taking them and which medicines to take. People with AIDS always take medicines every day. HIV medicines usually come in pills.\n\nHow do HIV medicines work?\nHIV medicines do not get rid of HIV from the body. But they do reduce the amount of HIV in your body. This helps you stay healthy longer.\n\nThere are different types of HIV medicines. Most people take pills from 3 or 4 different groups of medicines. The most common medicines include:\n- Protease inhibitors: These medicines are usually used in combination with other medicines. They can cause an upset stomach.\n- Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: These medicines also work best when used with other medicines. Side effects include an upset stomach and muscle pain.\n- Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: These medicines can be used with other medicines to treat HIV. Some can cause an upset stomach and rash. They can also interact with other medicines.\n- Integrase inhibitors: These medicines work by blocking an HIV enzyme that the virus needs to make copies of itself.\n- CCR5 inhibitors: These medicines can stop HIV from entering the cells of the body.\n- Fusion inhibitors: These medicines block HIV from entering the cells of the body.\n- Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors: These medicines are used with other medicines to treat HIV.\n\nDo I need to make any changes in my life?\nYes. You will need to:\n- Take your medicines every day, even if you feel well.\n    Target answer: The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: HIV is not easy to transmit from one person to another. For infection to take place, the virus must be present in a body fluid of an infected person, and it must enter the bloodstream of another person.\n\nThe body fluids that contain enough of the virus to cause infection are:\n- Blood\n- Semen\n- Vaginal fluids\n- Fluids surrounding the joints (synovial fluid)\n- Fluids surrounding the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid)\n\nOther body fluids, such as tears and saliva, contain only small amounts of the virus. HIV has never been spread through these fluids.\n\nHIV can enter the bloodstream through:\n- Cuts and sores in the skin\n- A vein (as with sharing needles)\n- The opening at the tip of the penis\n- The vaginal, anal, or rectal opening\n- The mouth of a nursing baby\n- A cut in the mouth\n- Needle sticks or cuts from sharp objects in health care settings\n\nHow is HIV NOT transmitted?\nPeople do not get HIV from:\n- Shaking hands or hugging someone who is infected\n- Kissing someone who is infected (although there is a very small risk of getting the disease from deep, open-mouth kissing with someone who has mouth sores)\n- Using a swimming pool, toilet, phone, or drinking glass that was also used by an infected person\n- Being bitten or stung by an insect\n- Food handled by an infected person\n- Sharing eating utensils with an infected person\n- Using exercise equipment at a gym\n\nWho is at risk for HIV infection?\nThe main risk for HIV is the sharing of needles during drug injection. Other risk factors for HIV include:\n- Having unprotected sex with a man or woman who is infected with HIV\n- Having unprotected sex with anyone whose HIV status you don't know\n- Having a blood transfusion or receiving blood products before 1985\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV infection?\nThere are no symptoms during the early stage of infection. Later, symptoms may include:\n- Fever\n- Swollen lymph nodes (in the neck, chest, armpits, groin, etc.)\n- Muscle and joint pain\n- Mouth sores\n- Skin rashes\n- Swollen or tender spleen\n\nWhat are the complications of HIV infection?\nOver time, HIV causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems and are more likely to get infections and certain types of cancer. The symptoms of AIDS can include:\n    Target answer: HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.\n    Background Question: How is HIV transmitted?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Comorbidity is increasingly a feature of PLHIV in HICs, and is associated with poor health outcomes, including greater functional limitations, reduced quality of life and greater health-care use and expenditure. A comprehensive overview of the comorbidity burden of PLHIV in Australia is lacking. Methods: Using Australia's national notifiable diseases database, we identified all PLHIV diagnosed before 2015. Using probabilistic linkage, we matched records to the National Hospital Morbidity Database to ascertain hospital admissions with comorbidities. We described comorbidities by age, sex and region of birth among PLHIV diagnosed before 2015. We calculated age-standardized incidence rate ratios (aSIRR) to describe comorbidity incidence in PLHIV relative to the general population. We also calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (aSPR) to describe comorbidity prevalence among PLHIV relative to the general population in 2015. Results and discussion: Among PLHIV in Australia in 2015, NCDs were common and their prevalence was greater than in the general population. Infectious diseases were also more common among PLHIV. Mental and behavioural disorders were the most common NCDs. Compared to the general population, PLHIV were at higher risk of hospital admission for mental and behavioural disorders (aSIRR 2.2, 95% CI: 2.1-2.3), diseases of the circulatory system (aSIRR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.7-1.9) and respiratory system (aSIRR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.5-1.7). PLHIV were at lower risk of hospital admission for neoplasms (aSIRR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.8-0.9). Among PLHIV in Australia, comorbidities are common and a large contributor to hospital admissions. Comprehensive health promotion, prevention, diagnosis and treatment services are required to address this burden. Conclusions: In Australia, PLHIV are at higher risk of hospitalization due to NCDs compared to the general population. Multidisciplinary\n    Target answer: The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals.\n    Background Question: What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Choose to be sexually active only with one partner, and limit the number of sexual partners over time.\n2. Have protected sexual intercourse with a condom every time. A latex condom can reduce the risk of HIV transmission, but it cannot prevent it entirely.\n3. Ask your doctor about PrEP. You can use this medication if you are in a relationship with a person living with HIV, if you are HIV-negative, and if you have had a sexually transmitted infection in the past 6 months.\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Design: A systematic review to assess the level of adherence needed to achieve and maintain suppression of VL below 50 copies/mL. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness for articles published from 1980 to July 2006. Studies were included if they reported on adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), VL suppression to <50 copies/mL, and duration of follow-up at least 3 months after HAART initiation. Results: We identified 11 studies, including 1855 patients, with adherence and VL measurements. The adherence and VL data were collected prospectively (8 studies), retrospectively (1 study), and both (2 studies). Adherence was measured by self-report (3 studies), pharmacy data (4 studies), pill count (1 study), and mixed (3 studies). There was significant heterogeneity in methods used to measure adherence and time to adherence and VL assessment. Adherence to HAART was generally high with 10/11 studies reporting greater than 75% adherence in the population. Despite this, only one study reported greater than 75% suppression of VL below 50 copies/mL. Conclusions: Studies have generally not demonstrated consistent suppression of VL below 50 copies/mL despite high levels of adherence. The studies included were heterogeneous and few included an analysis of the impact of level of adherence on viral suppression. In this systematic review, a minimum level of adherence necessary to achieve and maintain viral suppression below 50 copies/mL could not be determined.\nThe efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in suppressing viral replication depends on the drug regimen used as well as the ability of patients to adhere to the regimen. Adherence to HAART is essential for achieving and maintaining viral suppression and preventing the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV. Previous studies have found that less than 95% adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with virological failure [bib_ref] The relation of adherence to outcome among HIV-infected infants and children on..., Watson [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Adherence to protease inhibitor therapy and outcomes in patients with HIV infection, Paterson [/bib_ref] [bib_ref]\n    Target answer: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months.\n    Background Question: How frequently ART must be taken?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

However, macrophages are much less susceptible to infection and can become reservoirs of the virus. It is currently thought that the majority of infected cells in the body are macrophages and their number increases with the progression of the disease. It is also thought that the macrophages are responsible for the transport of the virus to different organs in the body. The CD4+ T helper cells are responsible for the induction of antibody production by B cells and for the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and it is this function that is most severely affected by HIV infection. A progressive reduction of the T helper cell count is the most important indicator of the course of the disease. This cell count is used to decide when to start treatment, how to follow the disease and what drugs to use.\n    Target answer: The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells.\n    Background Question: What are the main cell types infected with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Transmission through blood: transmission of HIV through infected blood (sharing syringes or drug use). Maternal transmission: transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or through breastfeeding. Transmission through blood transfusion: transmission of HIV through infected blood transfusion. How is HIV not transmitted? The following routes are not considered to be modes of transmission of HIV: Coughing, sneezing or spitting by an HIV-infected person. Eating or drinking from the same dishes and glasses as an HIV-infected person. Hugging, shaking hands, kissing, working, studying or going to school with a person who is HIV-positive. The use of public toilets or swimming pools or other public places with an HIV-infected person. Mosquito or insect bites.\n    Target answer: You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects.

This is partly because HIV is incredibly complex, and because its latent state has not been fully understood.\nIn an active infection, the virus replicates itself within host cells, but in a latent state, the virus remains hidden within the cell. If the virus remains latent, it does not cause harm to the person, but if it reactivates, it can quickly become an active infection.\nThe goal of the symposium was to discuss how to develop better HIV vaccines and treatments by targeting the mechanisms by which the virus remains latent.\nOne focus of the symposium was on how to \u201cwake up\u201d the latent virus in HIV patients so that it can be targeted and eliminated.\n\u201cPeople often wonder why we don\u2019t have a vaccine or a cure for HIV yet,\u201d said Jerome Zack, professor and chair of the Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics department in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and the director of CFAR.\n\u201cBut HIV is an incredibly complicated virus. It goes into a latent state, so it\u2019s hidden within our cells. It\u2019s difficult to target, but we need to find a way to wake it up.\u201d\nOne method of waking up the latent virus is using histone deacetylase inhibitors, or HDAC inhibitors, to activate the virus from its dormant state.\nDuring the symposium, participants presented and discussed their research findings in hopes of advancing the study of HIV.\n\u201cWe need to understand why HIV becomes latent, and how to wake it up, and then develop therapies and vaccines that will work to eliminate the virus,\u201d Zack said. \u201cWe also need to develop ways to better diagnose the virus in people.\u201d\nThe symposium included presentations from experts in\n    Target answer: The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
