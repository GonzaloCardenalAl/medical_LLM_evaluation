The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate. \n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment with corticosteroids may be warranted to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to manage increased intracranial pressure. However, the primary concern is to monitor and manage the increased intracranial pressure, which may require repeated lumbar punctures or other interventions such as a lumbar drain.\n\nChloramphenicol is not typically used as a first-line treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. The previous patient you treated with Chloramphenicol may have had a different condition or a specific contraindication to standard therapy.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol.

However, the presence of focal neurological signs (weakness in one hand) without mention of headache or altered mental status might also suggest a stroke, especially given his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe next best step would be to immediately order a non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, followed by an MRI if the CT is negative, to evaluate for other causes such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Additionally, lumbar puncture should be considered to evaluate for cryptococcal meningitis, but only after imaging has ruled out a space-occupying lesion to avoid the risk of herniation.\n\nEmpiric treatment with itraconazole is not the first step without further diagnostic evaluation, as it's more commonly used for histoplasmosis or blastomycosis, which might not be the primary concern here given the focal neurological deficit.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

The patient's low CD4+ count, high viral load, and noncompliance with medications support this diagnosis. The presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI is also consistent with HAD. While vascular dementia is a possibility, the patient's age, HIV status, and lack of other vascular risk factors make HAD a more likely diagnosis. Toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal infection are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen and the lack of mass effect on MRI.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite.

The most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), which is a common opportunistic malignancy in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The presence of EBV DNA in CSF supports this diagnosis, as EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

The most appropriate next step is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn. According to current guidelines, the recommended regimen for newborns is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, not a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. This is to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases.
