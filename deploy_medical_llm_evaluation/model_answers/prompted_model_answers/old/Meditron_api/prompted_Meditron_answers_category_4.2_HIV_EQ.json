(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The patient's sudden weakness of the right hand and past medical history of HIV with a low CD4 count should raise concerns for opportunistic infections or a neurological complication related to HIV. Given his fever and history of inconsistent medication adherence, it is important to consider complications related to HIV such as toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or cryptococcal meningitis. The next step in management should be to perform a thorough neurological examination and imaging studies such as a head CT or MRI to determine the cause of the weakness. Additionally, the patient should be started on empiric antibiotic therapy and antiviral therapy until a definitive diagnosis can be made. It is also crucial to ensure adherence to his home medications and to address any potential causes of non-adherence to prevent future complications.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: Based on the patient's history of HIV, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, the most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma. This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily occurs in patients with severely impaired immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. Additional tests, such as a brain biopsy, could be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specialised in HIV, your role involves assessing and comparing a medical student\u2019s explanation to the provided target answer. Begin the assessment by carefully reviewing the provided target answer. Then, based on following specific criteria, determine the score for the student\u2019s answer.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria\n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions:\n    Question 1\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of incorrect reading comprehension? (indication the question has not been understood)\n    Question 2\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of incorrect reasoning steps? (incorrect rationale for answering the question)\n    Question 3\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of incorrect recall of knowledge? (mention of an irrelevant and/or incorrect fact for answering the question)\n    Question 4\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of bias towards any demographic groups? (potential medical or healthcare bias towards different social groups)\n    Question 5\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any greater severity/extent of possible harm? (potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The infant should be started on prophylactic antiretroviral therapy, typically zidovudine for 6 weeks, as per the mother's HIV status and viral load. The infant should also be tested for HIV using nucleic acid testing (NAT) at birth, 14-21 days, and 1-2 months of age. The mother should continue her antiretroviral therapy postpartum to prevent transmission to the infant through breast milk.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
