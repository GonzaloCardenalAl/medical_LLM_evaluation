The opening pressure is significantly elevated (normal is <200 mm H2O), and repeated lumbar punctures to drain CSF can help relieve symptoms and potentially improve outcomes. The goal is to reduce the opening pressure by 50% or to below 200 mm H2O. These therapeutic LPs may need to be performed daily until the pressure normalizes and symptoms improve. This is in addition to the appropriate antifungal therapy (amphotericin B + flucytosine) that has already been initiated.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose.

The patient presents with focal neurological deficits (right hand weakness) and fever, which in the setting of advanced HIV (CD4 < 200) raises high suspicion for toxoplasmosis encephalitis.\n\n2. Key factors supporting this diagnosis:\n- Low CD4 count (77/mm\u00b3)\n- Inconsistent adherence to medications (including TMP-SMX prophylaxis)\n- Focal neurological deficit\n- Fever\n- Gradual onset of symptoms\n\n3. While other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis (including stroke, given his risk factors of hypertension and hyperlipidemia), the presence of fever and his immunocompromised status make an infectious process more likely.\n\n4. MRI with contrast is the preferred imaging modality because:\n- It can show the characteristic ring-enhancing lesions of toxoplasmosis\n- It can help differentiate between toxoplasmosis and other HIV-associated conditions like primary CNS lymphoma\n- It's more sensitive than CT for detecting early changes\n- It can also rule out other causes of focal deficits\n\nAfter obtaining the MRI, if toxoplasmosis is confirmed, treatment would typically include:\n- Pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine and leucovorin\n- Continuation or restart of antiretroviral therapy\n- Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Clinical Presentation:\n- Progressive neurological symptoms (1 week of weakness and gait problems)\n- Cognitive decline (memory problems, difficulty with familiar tasks)\n- Behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation)\n- Focal neurological deficit (right leg weakness)\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- MRI shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions\n- No mass effect (typical for PML)\n\n4. Time Course:\n- Gradual progression over months\n- Symptoms affecting multiple domains (motor, cognitive, behavioral)\n\nPML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS and CD4+ counts below 200/\u03bcL. The condition typically presents with progressive neurological deficits, cognitive decline, and characteristic MRI findings of white matter lesions.\n\nDifferential diagnoses considered but less likely:\n- Toxoplasmosis (typically presents with enhancing lesions with mass effect)\n- Cryptococcal meningitis (antigen negative)\n- HIV encephalopathy (typically more diffuse symptoms without focal deficits)\n- CNS lymphoma (typically presents with enhancing lesions)\n\nTreatment involves:\n1. Initiating antiretroviral therapy\n2. Supportive care\n3. Management of other comorbidities\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

Bone marrow suppression leading to:\n- Anemia\n- Neutropenia\n2. Myopathy\n3. Lactic acidosis\n\nFrom Indinavir:\n1. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)\n2. Hyperbilirubinemia\n3. Lipodystrophy\n4. Hyperglycemia\n\nFrom Lamivudine (3TC):\n1. Generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects\n2. Potential for hepatitis B flare if discontinued in co-infected patients\n\nAmong these, the most significant and concerning adverse effects to monitor for are:\n1. Bone marrow suppression from zidovudine\n2. Nephrolithiasis from indinavir\n\nImportant preventive measures:\n1. Regular monitoring of complete blood count\n2. Adequate hydration (especially with indinavir)\n3. Regular monitoring of renal function\n4. Periodic assessment of metabolic parameters\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n\n1. Patient Profile:\n- HIV-positive patient\n- Low CD4 count (90/\u03bcL) indicating severe immunosuppression\n- History of poor medication adherence\n\n2. Clinical Presentation:\n- Neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo)\n- Personality changes\n- Ataxia\n- Cognitive impairment (low MMSE score)\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- Solitary ring-enhancing lesion\n- Large size (4.5 cm)\n- Location in corpus callosum\n- Ring enhancement on MRI\n\n4. Laboratory Findings:\n- Positive EBV DNA in CSF\n- Mild pleocytosis in CSF\n\nPrimary CNS lymphoma in HIV patients is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. The typical presentation includes a large solitary lesion (unlike toxoplasmosis which usually presents with multiple smaller lesions), and the corpus callosum is a common location. The patient's severe immunosuppression (CD4 < 100) puts him at high risk for this condition.\n\nDifferential diagnoses to consider would include:\n- Toxoplasmosis (usually multiple smaller lesions)\n- Brain abscess\n- Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) (typically non-enhancing lesions)\n- CNS tuberculoma\n\nHowever, the combination of EBV positivity, imaging characteristics, and clinical presentation makes PCNSL the most likely diagnosis.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

All infants born to HIV-positive mothers require antiretroviral prophylaxis regardless of the mother's viral load or treatment status.\n\n2. For this case specifically:\n- Mother was on triple antiretroviral therapy\n- Viral load was detectable (678 copies/mL) but relatively low\n- No complications during delivery\n\n3. The recommended prophylaxis regimen in this case would be:\n- Zidovudine (ZDV) for 4 weeks\n- Additional medications might be considered based on risk factors\n\n4. Other important management steps include:\n- Avoid breastfeeding\n- Schedule follow-up HIV testing for the infant\n- Regular monitoring for medication side effects\n- Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis if indicated\n\nStarting antiretroviral prophylaxis promptly is crucial as it significantly reduces the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated.
