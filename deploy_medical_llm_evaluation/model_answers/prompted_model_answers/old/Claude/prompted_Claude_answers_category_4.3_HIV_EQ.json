Given the significantly elevated opening pressure (>250 mm H2O), therapeutic serial lumbar punctures should be performed to reduce intracranial pressure.\n\nKey points:\n- Opening pressure >250 mm H2O is associated with increased morbidity and mortality\n- Serial therapeutic LPs help reduce pressure and improve symptoms\n- Remove 20-30 mL of CSF at a time\n- Continue daily LPs until opening pressure is <200 mm H2O and symptoms improve\n- This is in addition to antifungal therapy (amphotericin B + flucytosine)\n\nHigh intracranial pressure in cryptococcal meningitis can lead to serious complications including vision loss and death if not properly managed. Therefore, pressure management through therapeutic LPs is an essential component of initial treatment.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose.

The patient presents with acute focal neurological deficits (right hand weakness) and fever, which in the setting of advanced HIV (CD4 < 200) raises high suspicion for toxoplasmosis encephalitis.\n\n2. Key factors supporting this diagnosis:\n- Advanced HIV with CD4 count of 77/mm\u00b3\n- Poor medication adherence (including to TMP-SMX, which provides prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis)\n- Focal neurological deficit\n- Fever\n- Gradual onset of symptoms\n\n3. While other diagnoses should be considered (such as stroke, given his risk factors of hypertension and hyperlipidemia), the presence of fever and his immunocompromised status make an infectious process more likely.\n\n4. MRI with contrast is the preferred imaging modality because:\n- It can show the characteristic \"ring-enhancing lesions\" of toxoplasmosis\n- It can help differentiate between toxoplasmosis and other HIV-associated conditions such as primary CNS lymphoma\n- It is more sensitive than CT for detecting early changes\n- It can also rule out other causes of focal weakness such as stroke or other space-occupying lesions\n\nAfter obtaining imaging, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis should be initiated if imaging is consistent with this diagnosis, while other workup continues in parallel.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n\n1. Patient Profile:\n- HIV-positive with poor compliance to treatment\n- Very low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) indicating severe immunosuppression\n- High viral load (>100,000 copies/mL)\n\n2. Clinical Presentation:\n- Progressive neurological symptoms (weakness, unsteady gait)\n- Cognitive decline (forgetfulness, difficulty with familiar tasks)\n- Behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation)\n- Focal neurological deficit (right leg weakness)\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- MRI showing disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions\n- No mass effect (typical for PML)\n\n4. Time Course:\n- Symptoms developing over weeks to months\n- Progressive deterioration\n\nPML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS and CD4+ counts <200/\u03bcL. The disease typically presents with progressive neurological deficits, cognitive decline, and characteristic MRI findings of white matter lesions.\n\nDifferential diagnoses considered but less likely:\n1. Toxoplasmosis (typically presents with enhancing lesions with mass effect)\n2. Cryptococcal meningitis (negative cryptococcal antigen)\n3. Primary CNS lymphoma (typically presents with enhancing lesions)\n4. HIV encephalopathy (typically more diffuse involvement)\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy\n2. Supportive care\n3. Close monitoring for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: Based on the antiretroviral medication regimen prescribed (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\nFor Zidovudine (AZT):\n1. Bone marrow suppression leading to:\n- Anemia\n- Neutropenia\n2. Myopathy\n3. Lactic acidosis\n4. Headache\n5. Gastrointestinal upset\n\nFor Indinavir:\n1. Kidney stones (most significant risk)\n2. Hyperbilirubinemia\n3. Lipodystrophy\n4. Hyperglycemia\n5. Gastrointestinal symptoms\n\nFor Lamivudine (3TC):\n1. Generally well-tolerated\n2. Possible headache\n3. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms\n4. Rare pancreatitis\n\nThe most significant adverse effects to monitor in this combination would be:\n1. Kidney stones from indinavir (requires adequate hydration)\n2. Bone marrow suppression from zidovudine\n3. Metabolic complications (particularly from indinavir)\n\nRegular monitoring of complete blood count, renal function, and metabolic parameters is essential.\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n\n1. Patient Profile:\n- HIV-positive patient\n- Low CD4+ count (90/\u03bcL), indicating severe immunosuppression\n- History of medication non-compliance\n\n2. Clinical Presentation:\n- Neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo)\n- Personality changes\n- Ataxia\n- Cognitive impairment (low MMSE score)\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- Solitary ring-enhancing lesion\n- Large size (4.5 cm)\n- Location in corpus callosum\n- These findings are typical for PCNSL in HIV patients\n\n4. CSF Analysis:\n- Positive EBV DNA PCR\n- This is highly significant as EBV is strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients\n- Slight pleocytosis is consistent with the diagnosis\n\nPrimary CNS lymphoma in HIV patients is:\n- Nearly always associated with EBV infection\n- More common in severely immunocompromised patients (CD4+ < 100/\u03bcL)\n- Often presents as a single lesion (unlike toxoplasmosis, which typically shows multiple lesions)\n- Has a predilection for periventricular areas and corpus callosum\n\nThe recent initiation of antiretroviral therapy could also suggest potential immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), but the clinical and imaging findings are more consistent with PCNSL.\n\nTreatment would typically involve:\n1. Antiretroviral therapy optimization\n2. High-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy\n3. Supportive care\n\nThe prognosis is generally poor without treatment, but can be improved with appropriate therapy and immune reconstitution.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

All infants born to HIV-positive mothers should receive antiretroviral prophylaxis regardless of the mother's viral load or treatment status during pregnancy.\n\n2. The standard prophylaxis regimen includes:\n- Zidovudine (AZT) for 6 weeks if mother had good viral control during pregnancy\n- Additional medications may be added if mother had poor viral control or unknown status\n\n3. In this case:\n- Mother received appropriate triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy\n- Her viral load was relatively low (678 copies/mL)\n- Therefore, zidovudine monotherapy is appropriate for the infant\n\n4. Additional management includes:\n- HIV testing of the infant using HIV DNA PCR at birth, 2-3 weeks, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months\n- Avoidance of breastfeeding\n- Regular monitoring for medication side effects and potential toxicities\n\nEarly initiation of prophylaxis is crucial to reduce the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities.
