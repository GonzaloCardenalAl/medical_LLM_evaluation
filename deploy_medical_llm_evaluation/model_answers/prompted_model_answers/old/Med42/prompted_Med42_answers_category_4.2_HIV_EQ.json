She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? \nA. Dexamethasone\nB. Valganciclovir\nC. Pyrimethamine and Sulfadiazine\nD. Voriconazole\n\nThe correct answer to this biomedical question is: A. Dexamethasone \n\nJustification: The patient described is presenting with symptoms suggestive of CNS infection and her lumbar puncture is consistent with Cryptococcal Meningitis. Dexamethasone may improve outcomes if there is a clinically significant increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), which is common in cryptococcal meningitis. This is usually indicated if there is an opening pressure greater than 250 mmH2O, which is true for this patient. IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine constitute appropriate first-line treatment for Cryptococcal Meningitis, but dexamethasone is the additional treatment warranted in this acute setting due to elevated ICP.\n\nValganciclovir (B) is used for CMV prophylaxis and treatment, not relevant here as the clinical picture doesn-  t suggest CMV infection.\n\nPyrimethamine and Sulfadiazine (C) are used for treatment of Toxoplasmosis, not Cryptococcal Meningitis.\n\nVoriconazole (D) is an antifungal, but it's primarily used for aspergillosis or invasive candidiasis, not cryptococcal infections.\n\nSo, it's A -  Dexamethasone.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test? \nFirst, draw a simple 2x2 table to answer your question. \n\n```\n            +-----------------------+\n            |               |  Screening Test  |\n            |  Disease Status  +-----------+-------+\n            |               |    +      |    -      |\n            +---------------+-----------+-------+\n            |  AIDS         | 240  |   10    |\n            |               +-----------+-------+\n            |  No AIDS      |   5  |  245    |\n            |               +-----------+-------+\n```\n\nThe number of true negatives is defined by the number of negative screenings in the \"no-AIDS\" group, which, in this case, is equal to 245. The false negatives are equal to the number of patients with AIDS (confirmed disease) but a negative screening test, which amounts to 10 in this study. \n\nNow, to calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), use the following formula:\n\n```\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n```\n\nPlugging in the numbers from the table:\n\n```\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%\n```\n\nSo, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96%. This means that if the test result is negative, there is a 96% chance that the patient does not actually have AIDS. Please note that actual calculations in practice might involve more decimal places for precision, but for demonstration purposes, a rounded percentage serves well. \n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient? \n\nA - Immediately administer IV alteplase given symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke. \nB - Obtain an urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine to clarify the neurological findings before intervening.\nC - Conduct an EKG and echocardiogram to investigate possible cardiac embolism as cause of stroke before initiating thrombolytics.\nD - Administer IV steroids presuming an inflammatory CNS process like acute myelitis or multiple sclerosis before imaging.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThis patient's symptoms suggest acute ischemic stroke, typically a vascular emergency that merited speedy evaluation. However, his presentation is complicated by a fever indicating possible infective etiology or secondary infection in an immunosuppressed HIV patient. Additionally, his low CD4 count and inconsistent medication adherence suggest potential opportunistic infections or inflammatory processes that could mimic stroke, such as CNS toxoplasmosis or Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)\u2014both possibilities in an HIV patient with compromised immunity.\n\nGiven these complexities, immediate thrombolysis with IV alteplase (Option A) without definitive imaging is not the next best step. Similarly, administering IV steroids (Option D) without confirming the diagnosis could hinder subsequent diagnostic tests or even mask symptoms for a time-sensitive differential like stroke.\n\nThe most prudent step would be to obtain urgent brain MRI (Option B), which can distinguish between ischemic stroke, infectious or demyelinating processes. MRI will provide clearer images than a CT scan, particularly in evaluating the posterior fossa, and is more sensitive for detecting early ischemia. Moreover, MRI can help rule out other pathologies mimicking stroke in an immunocompromised patient. If stroke is confirmed, a cardiac evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram (Option C) would be appropriate to evaluate for potential embolic sources later in the course of care.\n\nTo summarize, in this case, obtaining an urgent MRI to clarify neurological findings is the best next step, given the need for precise diagnosis before initiating thrombolytic or immunosuppressive treatments in a high-risk patient with HIV and fever. This decision emphasizes the careful weighing of diagnostic certainty before proceeding with potentially irreversible therapies.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand.

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nA. HIV-associated dementia\nB. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\nC. Cryptococcal meningitis\nD. Toxoplasmosis\nE. HIV-associated lymphoma\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. PML is a subacute, demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus and occurs typically in patients with CD4 counts less than 100 cells/\u03bcL. It is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV, and the lesions are typically multifocal, bilateral, and involve cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. PML usually presents with progressive neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, personality changes, and seizures. The neuroimaging shows hypodense white matter lesions without mass effect or enhancement. Despite treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy, PML typically has a poor outcome. HIV-associated dementia is associated with global cognitive impairment, and MRI findings may show diffuse brain atrophy. Cryptococcal meningitis typically presents with headache, fever, and meningismus, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals increased white blood cell count, elevated opening pressure, and a positive cryptococcal antigen test. Toxoplasmosis typically presents as focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, or seizures, and the lesions may appear as ring-enhancing with mass effect on MRI. HIV-associated lymphoma usually presents with focal neurological deficits and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, and MRI findings may show mass lesions with enhancement and surrounding edema. So, the correct answer is: b. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls.

She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit? Select ALL that apply (there could be more than one).a. Gonorrhea culture or NAAT testb. Pap smearc. Hepatitis B serology testd. Hemoglobin (HgB) A1ce. Varicella titer testf. Rh blood type and antibody screen\n\nCorrect Answer: a, c, f\n\nJustification:\n\na. Gonorrhea culture or NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) is appropriate because, despite the patient's previous test 4 years ago, it's a sexually transmitted infection with potential harm to pregnancy and neonate, and current guidelines recommend screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women, especially given no specified monogamy or unchanged sexual partner status since her last test (CDC, 2021).\n\nc. Hepatitis B serology (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) is necessary for pregnant women as recommended by guidelines (ACOG & USPSTF). Hepatitis B infection in pregnancy can lead to vertical transmission and chronic disease in the newborn if not managed appropriately. A negative result from 4 years ago does not ensure immunity or freedom from infection since the last test.\n\nf. Determining Rh blood type and performing an antibody screen are essential parts of prenatal care, as maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility (Rh-D) can lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn if left untreated. Even without a history of previous pregnancy or blood transfusion, the woman's current Rh status and antibody screen should be checked (ACOG).\n\nThe following are not indicated at this visit:\n\nb. Pap smear - While Pap smears are essential for cervical cancer screening, current guidelines recommend they not be performed during pregnancy unless previous results indicate dysplasia or cancer surveillance is required (ACOG). This patient's history does not suggest such.\n\nd. Hemoglobin A1c test - There's no diabetes history in this patient, and she's not symptomatic for it. Routine HbA1c is not indicated unless there's a suspicion of undiagnosed diabetes or the patient belongs to a high-risk group, neither of which is the case here (ADA & ACOG).\n\ne. Varicella titer test - Although knowing an individual's immunity to varicella is useful pre-conception or when considering vaccination postpartum, it's not a critical testing item during an otherwise standard prenatal visit, especially if no specific exposure or outbreak is reported (ACOG). It can be evaluated during discussions\n    Target answer: Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit.

Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is used as primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis infections in HIV-positive individuals with a CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3. \n\nIncorrect answers:\nA) Dapsone + Trimethoprim is an alternative prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia but is not recommended as first-line treatment.\nB) Azithromycin + Leukovorin has no specific role in HIV prophylaxis, particularly for Pneumocystis jirovecii.\nC) Albendazole and Mebendazole are anti-parasitic medications not relevant for HIV-related prophylaxis or opportunistic infections management. They are primarily used against helminthic infections such as hookworms and roundworms.\n\nThis patient should consult with his mental health provider as well for his depression, addressing this comorbidity which led to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. A multidisciplinary approach incorporating both infectious disease and psychiatric care is crucial in such cases.\n    Target answer: In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

Clarithromycin\n\nAnswer: C. Erythromycin\n\nRationale: The skin lesions and biopsy findings are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis caused by Bartonella infection (B. quintana or B. henselae). Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice for this infection. The patient's symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., low CD4+T-lymphocyte count, oral candidiasis indicated by white patches on her palate) also confirm advanced HIV infection. Considering her HIV status, it is essential to address this opportunistic infection aggressively.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to treating bacillary angiomatosis:\nA. Rifampin, ethambutol, and isoniazid: These medications are used for tuberculosis, not Bartonella infection.\nB. Vancomycin: Primarily used for Gram-positive bacterial infections, not Bartonella infection.\nD. Ceftriaxone: Broad-spectrum antibiotic for various infections, but not the preferred choice for Bartonella infection.\nE. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: For prophylaxis or treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii in HIV+ individuals; not specifically for Bartonella.\nF. Amphotericin B: Primarily an antifungal medication, not used for bacterial infections like Bartonella.\nG. Clarithromycin: While an alternative macrolide for Bartonella infection if there is intolerance to erythromycin, it's not the initial choice specified in the context.\n\nRemember, it's essential to always consider the patient's bigger clinical picture, including any concurrent infections or prophylactic needs based on their immune status, but for this specific question, erythromycin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. For comprehensive management, including follow-up and prevention strategies, consult a trusted medication reference or consult with a pharmacist.\ufffd\u200b\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week.

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? \nA. Diabetes mellitus\nB. Anaphylaxis\nC. Hypertriglyceridemia\nD. Hemolytic anemia\n\nAnswer: C. Hypertriglyceridemia\n\nExplanation: Hypertriglyceridemia is a significant adverse effect of protease inhibitors, such as indinavir, that can precipitate pancreatitis. Although the likelihood of this effect increases at doses greater than that used to treat HIV, it remains a significant side effect. Diabetes mellitus can occur, but it is less common with zidovudine as compared with didanosine (not given to this patient). Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction to antibiotics, often penicillin, that is usually IgE-mediated. While rare life-threatening allergic reactions may occur with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, anaphylaxis is not typical. Hemolytic anemia is a recognized side effect of zidovudine and other reverse transcriptase inhibitors, but only after prolonged administration or with patients with a severe decrease in baseline hemoglobin due to bone marrow failure. Additionally, this patient's complete blood count is not abnormal at this time. Lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has an otherwise benign side effect profile. So, the correct answer is C. Hypertriglyceridemia.\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night.

HIV-associated central nervous system lymphoma\nB. Cerebral toxoplasmosis\nC. Cerebral abscess\nD. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. This patient is presenting with symptoms that are suggestive of a central nervous system (CNS) mass lesion, such as headaches and seizures. He is immunocompromised due to HIV. MRI findings are characteristic of a CNS mass lesion with ring enhancement. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA on cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction supports a diagnosis of HIV-associated CNS lymphoma. CNS toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple, not single, lesions. While Toxoplasma species can be associated with HIV infection, this patient's MRI findings, coupled with his cerebrospinal fluid PCR results, make CNS toxoplasmosis less likely. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus on cerebrospinal fluid PCR does not support cerebral abscess as a diagnosis. Progressive multifocal leuko- encephalopathy (PML) is classically associated with JC virus, and the MRI findings in this patient make PML less likely, given ring enhancement. So, the correct answer is: a. HIV-associated central nervous system lymphoma  2. Ans.

The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?A. Offer post-exposure prophylaxis with triple antiretroviral therapy and follow-up as for perinatal HIV exposureB. Treat the infant with zidovudine alone for 6 weeksC. Discharge home with routine newborn care without antiretroviral therapy for the infantD. Perform a complete sepsis workup and initiate ampicillin and gentamicin due to prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal HIV status So, the correct answer is: A. Offer post-exposure prophylaxis with triple antiretroviral therapy and follow-up as for perinatal HIV exposure Let's think about this step-by-step. In this scenario, the infant is exposed to HIV due to maternal infection. The optimal management strategy involves offering postexposure prophylaxis with triple antiretroviral therapy, typically including zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or lopinavir-ritonavir, for at least 6 weeks, as this has been shown to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Follow-up testing for HIV infection in the infant should be conducted at birth, 2 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3-4 months, and 12-18 months using nucleic acid tests (NATs) such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid HIV antigen/antibody test (4th generation).\n\nOption B, treating the infant with zidovudine alone for 6 weeks, is not optimal because monotherapy may lead to resistance mutations and suboptimal prevention of transmission. Although zidovudine alone is an alternative option for resource-limited settings, triple therapy is preferred in developed nations.\n\nOption C is incorrect because withholding antiretrovirals entirely would leave the infant at risk for vertical transmission, which can occur during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding.\n\nOption D is also incorrect. Although HIV-positive mothers may pose a slightly increased risk for neonatal infections, there is no evidence of prolonged rupture of membranes in this case (the question does not mention that detail), and initiation of ampicillin and gentamicin without a clinical indication for sepsis evaluation would be inappropriate. Furthermore, the sepsis workup is not specific to infants born to HIV-positive mothers and should be guided by the infant's clinical status rather than maternal HIV status alone.\n\nIn summary, the most appropriate next step is to offer triple antiretroviral therapy as post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant,\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman.
