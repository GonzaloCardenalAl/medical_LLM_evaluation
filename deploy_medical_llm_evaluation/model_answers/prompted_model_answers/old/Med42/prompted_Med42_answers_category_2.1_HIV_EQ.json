The answer to your question is: There were no antiretroviral drugs administered for HIV in 1990 in Switzerland, or anywhere else except AZT, also known as Zidovudine.\n\nIn the 1990s, AZT was used as monotherapy for HIV infection. It was used since 1986 and was only approved for HIV in 1987. Since then, AZT had remained the only drug against HIV for several years.\n\n\n  By mid-1990, over 200,000 prescriptions for zidovudine (AZT) had\n  been written, primarily for patients with advanced HIV disease.\n  \n ...In the US, zidovudine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n  (FDA) only 25 months after being first tested in patients, and within\n  5 years more than 90% of HIV-infected people in the US, Australia,\n  and Western Europe with advanced HIV disease were taking it.\n  (source)\n\n\nThe first drug combination against HIV, the dual therapy \"ddI/AZT\", was announced and approved in 1991-1992. Triple therapy with protease inhibitors came only later, in 1996.\n\nHere you can see the timeline of ART developments (from Wikipedia):\n\n\n\n\nA study from 1992 looked back at the ART usage in Switzerland between 1989 and late April, 1991 and found that, on average, among HIV patients who were eligible to receive AZT, 51% received it.\n\n\n  We observed the utilization of AIDS treatment in all ambulatory and\n  hospitalized patients attending 24 selected hospitals and private\n  practices in Switzerland between August 1, 1989, and April 21, 1991.\n  Our study sample included 1,144 patients, representing about 20% of\n  the registered HIV infections in Switzerland...During this study,\n  zidovudine was prescribed to 80% of our sample...\n  Among these, 51% were eligible for zidovudine according to Swiss\n  guidelines; half of them received zidovudine treatment on a permanent\n  basis (median duration of prescribed zidovudine treatment among\n  compliant patients was 12.7 months).\n\n\nIn conclusion, in 1990 there was only one approved drug against HIV available: AZT.\n\nSource:\n\n\nAIDS Care. 1992;4(3):281\u201390.

We retrieved  antiretroviral treatment (ART) combinations, consisting of any possible regimen  of 3 or more drugs, from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) for 2010. Among this cohort, 7317 HIV-infected patients were on an ART regimen for at least 3 months in 2010 and were included in our evaluation. Data from all 3- or greater drug antiretroviral regimens used by this group are shown in Figure 2 below.\n\nBased on this data, what are the top five antiretroviral drug frequencies  given to HIV patients in Switzerland in 2010?\n\n\nFigure 2: Antiretroviral regimens prescribed for HIV infected patients in Switzerland in 2010 (SHCS).\n\nFrom: Swiss HIV Cohort Study, 2011 Annual Report\n\nFor reference, here are the abbreviations for the antiviral drug classes:\n\n\nM - Multidrug combination\nN - NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)\nP - Protease inhibitor\nI - Fusion inhibitor\nE - CCR5 antagonist (entry inhibitor)\n\nNRTIs (Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors):\n\n\nTDF - Tenofovir disoproxil\nABC - Abacavir\nAZT - Zidovudine\nd4T - Stavudine\n3TC - Lamivudine\nFTC - Emtricitabine &lt;-- same mechanism of action as 3TC\nDDI - Didanosine\nddC - Zalcitabine\n\nNote that some of these (TDF, FTC) are often given in fixed dose combinations (e.g., Truvada).  The graph lists individual drugs only, not fixed dose \"multidrug\" combinations.\n\n\nSince I have already transcribed the results here, it would seem a simple task to identify the top five antiviral drugs in this cohort.  However, looking at the chart below, we can see that the five highest used drugs have an almost identical percentage of use: 4th: 63.1%, 3rd: 64.1%, 2nd: 64.4%, 1st: 65.8%, AND 6th: 65.9%.  I wouldn't dare rank them without better clarification.\n\nQuestion: Are rankings based on percentage of use generally rounded to the nearest whole number?  Is there rounding error occurring here?\n    Target answer: The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs  were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

What is the probability of transmission of HIV to the child during childbirth?\n\nBased on an article published 2015 in AIDS care: Health and Social Aspects, Swiss study found that:\n\nIn 2010, in Switzerland the HIV birth rate is 1 in 1000. It also mentions that based on a study by Walker et al. among women with HIV (CD4 >500) the rate of transmission of HIV to the children in the absence of prevention therapy is 12%.\n\nI tried to find the overall birth rate among Swiss women in 2010 from the World Bank website, and found it to be approx. 1.5 per capita (1,494 per 100,000 population). There was no distinction of HIV status however.\n\nAs far as transmission rates are concerned, I tried to find research on current prevention therapy available and found that with timely intervention, the rate can be significantly reduced to 0.3\u20131.3% (Eur J Pediatr, 2009).\n\nThis information, however, seems inconclusive to me. Is the statement \"In 2010, the HIV birth rate is 1 in 1000\" referring to overall birth rate in Switzerland, or births among HIV positive women?\n\nCould you provide me with more information on how reliable the conclusion \"1 in 1000\" is based on the data presented.\n\nSummary:\n\nBirth rate for the entire Swiss population in 2010 is 1.5 per capita (1,494 per 100,000 population). \n\nEstimated birth rate for HIV positive women in 2010, in Switzerland, is reportedly 1 in 1000, based on Walker's study.\n\nWith proper prevention therapy, rates of transmission to babies (MTCT, mother-to-child transmission) can be significantly lowered to 0.3\u20131.3%. \n\nQuestion:\n\nIs the statement \"In 2010, the HIV birth rate is 1 in 1000\" referring to the overall birth rate in Switzerland rather than \"births among HIV positive women\", and if so, why? Also, how reliable is this conclusion?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, the conclusion \"1 in 1000 HIV birth rate in 2010\" is not referring to the overall birth rate in Switzerland, but rather specifically to births among HIV-positive women in Switzerland during that year.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the study mentioned, Walker et al., which assessed the incidence of HIV births in Switzerland.

The present study aims to assess HIV prevalence in childbearing women and to assess if women with HIV had a lower rate of giving birth when compared to women without HIV and therefore if Switzerland meets the UNAIDS Global Strategy Target 1.2 for birth rate in women living with HIV (WLWH), i.e. a birth rate equal to or below the national average.\nIn Switzerland, over the last decades, advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved the prognosis of WLWH who can now expect a near-normal life expectancy. Furthermore, with successful suppression of viral replication on ART, the risk of perinatal transmission is negligible. However, women with and without HIV may have different sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., differences in age, origin, educational status) which might influence reproductive behaviour.\nTo determine HIV prevalence in childbearing women in Switzerland, data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the national birth registry were used. These data were linked by sex, age (year of birth) and canton of residence in an anonymous way. This methodology allowed us to assess whether childbearing women with or without HIV had a similar overall birth rate in 2020.\nOverall, the prevalence of HIV among childbearing women was 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35-0.45), meaning that about 1 in 250 births corresponded to a mother living with HIV. When comparing the HIV-infected women with HIV-uninfected women in the study, childbearing WLWH had a significantly lower national birth rate than comparator women without HIV, with an adjusted relative risk of 0.51 (95%CI: 0.43-0.59).\nThis study shows that WLWH have lower birth rates compared to HIV-negative women, meaning that Switzerland does not meet the UNAIDS Global Strategy Target 1.2. Future investigations are warranted to explore sociodemographic disparities and barriers to reproductive health in WLWH in Switzerland.\nThe results of this study will be presented at the 29th Annual Conference of the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in Edinburgh on Monday, April 17, 2023.

The most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland continues to be sexual contact between men, accounting for approximately 50% of all new cases annually. The exact percentage may vary slightly from year to year based on surveillance data from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and other sources.\n\nAccording to the latest available reports and data from 2019, men having sex with men (MSM) represent the largest transmission category for HIV in Switzerland. This group includes gay, bisexual, and other men who engage in sexual activities with other men. The proportion of new HIV diagnoses attributed to MSM has remained consistently high over recent years, with slight fluctuations:\n\n1. In 2019, MSM accounted for 52.2% of newly diagnosed HIV infections (Swiss HIV Cohort Study). This figure includes not only Swiss nationals but also foreign residents living in Switzerland.\n2. Between 2015 and 2019, a trend analysis from the EuroHIV (now ECDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) reports that MSM represented an average of 53% of newly diagnosed HIV infections in Switzerland (ECDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance in Europe 2019).\n3. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health's HIV/AIDS surveillance report for 2019 also confirms that MSM are the most affected group, representing 49.6% of the 521 reported new HIV infections.\n\nWhile heterosexual contact and injection drug use are other significant transmission categories in Switzerland, they account for a considerably smaller percentage of new HIV infections, with heterosexual contact generally ranging between 23% and 30% and injection drug use around 10%. Other risk categories, like blood transfusions and mother-to-child transmission, have become rare due to effective prevention measures and strict screening practices for blood donations.\n\nPlease note that HIV transmission patterns can evolve over time and might be influenced by various factors, including changes in sexual practices, population migration, and access to prevention and treatment services. Therefore, it's essential to refer to updated epidemiological data or consult with reputable public health authorities for the most recent information. \n    Target answer: The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use.\n    Background Question: What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

And what is the underlying reason for this behavior?\n\nTreatment adherence, or compliance, refers to the extent to which patients follow their prescribed medical treatment regimens, including medication, in the manner advised by healthcare professionals. In Switzerland, a study published in the BMC Health Services Research journal (Loppi etet al., 2017) examined self-reported adherence among Swiss HIV patients. The study used data collected from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), which is an ongoing prospective cohort including most HIV-infected outpatients treated in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to the study, approximately 32% of visits involved patients who reported missing their antiretroviral treatment at least once per month (Loppi et al., 2017). These instances of missed doses were predominantly attributed to forgetfulness (76.2%), while being \"away from home\" (10.1%) and substance use (5.8%) were secondary reasons (ibid.). Forgetfulness was the dominant reason for non-adherence across all age groups, educational levels, and both genders.\n\nTo contextualize these findings, it's relevant to note that HIV treatment regimens have evolved significantly since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Currently, ART involves complex combinations of drugs but has become more simplified in recent years with single-tablet regimens. Nonetheless, lifelong adherence remains crucial for virological suppression and prevention of acquired resistance. While this study only examined HIV patients, other chronic conditions also require consistent adherence for optimal outcomes, and forgetfulness might similarly play a significant role in these contexts.\n\nReferences:\nLoppi, K., Calmy, A., Keiser, O., et al.

The review synthesizes findings from 26 studies in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, with a total sample size of 8,111 people living with HIV (PLWH).\n\nRegarding the specific question: What proportion of PLWH feel guilty because they have HIV?\n\nThe included studies utilized various measures to assess self-stigma, including the HIV Stigma Scale, Berger's Stigma Scale, and other instruments. Despite variations in measurement tools, a common theme across studies was feelings of guilt associated with HIV status.\n\nFrom the meta-analysis:\n- The pooled prevalence rate for \"feeling guilty\" due to having HIV was calculated at approximately 41.2% (Confidence Interval: 34.8 - 47.9) across all included studies.\n- Subgroup analysis revealed higher prevalence rates in low- and middle-income countries (46.6%, 95% CI: 37.9 - 55.4) compared to high-income countries (31.1%, 95% CI: 23.5 - 39.5).\n- Longitudinal studies indicated that feelings of guilt might persist over time, despite advances in antiretroviral therapy and improved health outcomes.\n\nNotably, these findings represent data up until 2020. Future studies may produce updated prevalence rates, as societal changes and interventions aimed at reducing HIV stigma continue to evolve.\n\nOverall, around 41% of PLWH, as per the evidence up to 2020, reported feelings of guilt due to their HIV status. However, regional differences and variations based on study designs should be considered when interpreting these results. \n\nSource:\nStoyanov, S. R., Mantas, S., Joffe, H., & Katz, J. (2021).

According to the UK's 2020 National HIV Patient Experience Survey, a significant proportion of people living with HIV report feeling stigmatized or judged.\n\nAs per the survey results, approximately 28% of PWH respondents felt that \"People with HIV are treated like outcasts\" in 2020. This highlights that nearly three in ten individuals with HIV in the UK perceive a considerable level of social exclusion or ostracism due to their HIV status.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that stigma experienced by PWH arises from a complex interplay of factors, including misinformation, fear, prejudice, and discriminatory practices. This perception of being treated like outcasts can negatively impact the mental health, physical wellbeing, and social integration of those living with HIV, as well as their access to care and adherence to treatment.\n\nTackling HIV-related stigma is crucial for addressing these issues. This may involve concerted efforts to:\n1. Improve public understanding: By disseminating accurate information and promoting awareness campaigns focused on debunking myths and misconceptions about HIV transmission, treatment, and survivability.\n2. Foster inclusive environments: Support organizations and healthcare providers in adopting nondiscriminatory policies and practices to create safe, welcoming spaces for PWH.\n3. Encourage peer support: Strengthen networks of solidarity among PWH and amplify their voices to counteract stigma narratives.\n4. Address healthcare worker bias: Educate healthcare providers about HIV, its management, and the importance of respecting and upholding the dignity of PWH.\n\nBy driving these initiatives, we can work collaboratively to minimize stigma and promote a supportive, inclusive environment that ensures the health and social wellbeing of people living with HIV.\n\nSources:\n1.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20? What proportion of those had their first positive HIV test between the ages of 10-14?\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant data source\nTo answer this question, we need to consult reliable data sources that provide statistics on people with HIV (PWH) who died from HIV-related causes and their age at the time of their first positive HIV test.\n\nA credible data source for this information would be the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or UNAIDS. Both organizations track global HIV statistics and regularly update detailed data on HIV cases, including demographics and mortality figures. For this analysis, we'll use CDC data, as it tends to be more granular, especially for age-specific statistics within the United States.\n\nStep 2: Consult CDC data\nAccording to CDC's HIV Surveillance Report, 2019 (the most recent data available), there were 15,815 deaths attributed to HIV in the United States in 2018. Of these deaths, 17.1% were among individuals aged 20-29 at the time of death (not exactly at first HIV test, but it's the closest category CDC provides for age grouping of deceased PWH).\n\nHowever, to narrow down the statistics to those who had their first positive HIV test before age 20, CDC does not have an exact figure. But using the CDC's supplemental data on HIV diagnoses in Youth 13-24, we can estimate the proportion.\n\nBased on the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), approximately 6% of HIV diagnoses among youths aged 13-24 occurred among those aged 13-19 at diagnosis. Although this data does not perfectly correspond to deaths (as we're interested in mortality rather than diagnosis), it nonetheless provides a reasonable proxy to estimate the proportion in question.\n\nNow, to find the proportion of those who had their first positive HIV test between the ages of 10-14, CDC data shows that less than 1% of HIV diagnoses among youths aged 13-24 occur among 10- to 14-year-olds (Source: CDC HIV Infections Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States, 2018).\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the data\nFrom the above information, we can approximate the proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes and had their first positive HIV test before age 20 as around 6% (based on the YRBS data), with about 1% or less having their first positive test between ages 10-14, given very low diagnosis\n    Target answer: Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20.\n    Background Question: What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

In this case, we'd consider the age group (before 20 vs. after 20) as a categorical predictor variable.\n\nStep 3: Hypothesis\nThe null hypothesis (H0) would be that there's no difference in the time taken for the CD4 count to drop below 200 between individuals who were diagnosed before or after age 20, given an initial CD4 count above 300.\nThe alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that the CD4 decline to below 200 differs significantly between these two age groups (i.e., those diagnosed before age 20 experience a faster/slower decline than those diagnosed afterward).\n\nStep 4: Data and controls\nWe would need a large, representative cohort or registry data with accurate dates of HIV diagnosis and CD4 count measurements to perform this analysis. To minimize confounding, we would control for relevant covariates, such as sex, race/ethnicity, transmission risk group, and antiretroviral therapy initiation.\n\nStep 5: Interpreting results\nIf the analysis shows a significant difference between individuals diagnosed before or after age 20, we might conclude that age at diagnosis has an impact on CD4 decline trajectories. This could have implications for treatment strategies, monitoring schedules, or risk counseling for younger people living with HIV (PWH).\n\nRemember that this is a simplified outline. The actual methods and complexities of analysis, including handling potential confounders and missing data, would require more detailed consideration.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
