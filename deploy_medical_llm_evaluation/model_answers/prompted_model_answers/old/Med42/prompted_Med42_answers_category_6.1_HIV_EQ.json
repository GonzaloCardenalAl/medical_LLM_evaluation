She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? 1. Addition of IV ceftriaxone 2. Addition of PO rifampin 3. Addition of PO fluconazole 4. Addition of PO thiamine The correct answer to this question is: 1. Addition of IV ceftriaxone The patient's symptoms are most consistent with cryptococcal meningitis which is confirmed with the findings on lumbar puncture. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS. The standard induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis includes amphotericin B plus flucytosine. However, there is some evidence to suggest adding ceftriaxone improves outcomes in these patients via its ability to reduce CSF inflammation. The other options are not appropriate in the acute setting. Chloramphenicol is not an effective treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Rifampin is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis and bacterial meningitis, not cryptococcal meningitis. Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal, but induction therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine is the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis and the preferred treatment by IDSA guidelines.

The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test? \n\nWhich of the following terms best describes the NPV of this screening test?\n\nThe correct answer to this biomedical question is: 245 / (245 + 10)\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant data\nIn this study, we have two groups: patients with confirmed AIDS (250) and patients without AIDS (250). The novel screening examination yielded results as follows:\n- 240 patients with AIDS tested positive (true positives)\n- 5 patients without AIDS tested positive (false positives)\nWe're tasked with finding the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel test, which represents the proportion of patients with a negative test result who truly do not have AIDS.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the true negatives\nFor NPV, we need to know how many patients without AIDS had a negative test result. Since there are 250 patients in the control arm (those without AIDS) and 5 tested positive, the number of true negatives can be found by subtracting the false positives from the total in the control group:\nTrue Negatives = 250 (total control patients) - 5 (false positives) = 245\n\nStep 3: Calculate the false negatives\nNow, we need to look at the AIDS group (250 patients) to find out how many patients tested negative despite having AIDS (false negatives). Since 240 patients in the AIDS group tested positive, the remaining patients are those who tested negative:\nFalse Negatives = 250 (total AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10\n\nStep 4: Compute the NPV\nWith true negatives (245) and false negatives (10) calculated, we can now compute NPV:\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives) = 245 / (245 + 10)\n\nThus, the correct answer is \"245 / (245 + 10)\", which represents the Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening test as the proportion of patients with a negative test result who genuinely do not have AIDS. Note that this value is not in decimal form (a common representation of NPV) but rather as a fraction \u2013 both forms describe the same concept.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient? \nA. Urgent MR venogram of the brain and itraconazole dose initiation\nB. Immediate CT angiogram of head and neck vessels and itraconazole dose initiation\nC. Blood cultures, MRI of brain and cervical spine, and empirical voriconazole for invasive fungal infection coverage\nD. Comprehensive metabolic panel, MRI of brain and cervical spine, and empirical amphotericin B for invasive fungal infection coverage\nE. Echocardiogram, CT angiogram of head and neck vessels, and low-molecular-weight heparin initiation\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. This patient presents with acute focal neurological symptoms (right hand weakness) and fever in the context of poorly controlled HIV (low CD4 count) and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Although there is a family history of cardiovascular events (father's myocardial infarction and mother's stroke), the primary concern here is an infectious etiology, particularly considering the immunocompromised state. The key differential diagnoses include central nervous system infections such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and invasive fungal infections, possibly related to aspergillosis given the fever and history of pneumonia last year (Aspergillus can have delayed post-pneumonia complications, including brain invasion).\n\nOut of the options presented:\nA. MR venogram wouldn't be the first-line imaging for this scenario; it's more indicated for suspected venous sinus thrombosis.\nB. CT angiogram for vessels isn't directly relevant, given the primary suspicion of an infectious process (although a secondary stroke can't be ruled out yet, CT angiogram wouldn't be first-line).\nC. This option is more plausible - blood cultures are essential for any fever in a patient with potential immunosuppression, and MRI of brain and cervical spine would assess for toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, or invasive fungal abscesses. However, the choice of empirical antifungal treatment might be suboptimal since voriconazole, while effective against aspergillosis, doesn't cover Cryptococcus well and has slower CNS penetration compared to amphotericin.\nD. This option seems the best overall for initial management. Comprehensive metabolic panel will help assess renal function before potentially nephrotoxic amphotericin B is initiated. MRI of brain and spine covers CNS infections as mentioned, and amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug that covers Cryptococcus, Asperg\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand.

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe correct answer to this biomedical question is: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis patient presents with a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, falls, cognitive decline (forgetfulness, getting lost, difficulty with appliances), and behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation, restlessness). The patient is HIV-positive, noncompliant with medications, and shows laboratory evidence of severe immunosuppression (very low CD4+ count, high viral load) and anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (suggesting overall hematopoietic suppression or bone marrow dysfunction).\n\nThe MRI findings demonstrate disseminated white matter lesions without mass effect, which are typical of diffuse microvascular or demyelinating disease processes but not consistent with the space-occupying lesions seen in toxoplasmosis (ruled out by absence of contrast enhancement) or cryptococcal disease (negative serum antigen). Given the context of HIV infection, severe immunosuppression, and diffuse neurological symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND).\n\nWhile vascular dementia is indeed a cause of cognitive decline\u2014often linked to diabetes, hypertension, or advanced age\u2014it is less likely here because the MRI does not indicate typical vascular insults like infarcts or extensive microangiopathy, and the cognitive and motor symptoms presented are more diffuse and less \"stroke-like\" than typically seen in vascular dementia.\n\nToxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis, while common in advanced HIV, are less likely given the MRI appearance and negative antigen tests. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is another possibility but might be distinguished by contrast enhancement or \"black holes\" on MRI, which are absent here. HAND can cause varied combinations of motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms and diffuse MRI changes without enhancement, fitting this complex clinical pattern.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls.

When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?  Primary prophylaxis is usually an indication for pneumocystis pneumonia or toxoplasmosis when CD4+ counts are less than 200 cells/mm3. Pneumocystis pneumonia is the more frequent infection among the two. Therefore, the correct answer is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). TMP/SMX is administered for prophylaxis after the patient's CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3. Fluconazole is typically prescribed for cryptococcal infections or fluconazole-refractory candidiasis, which isn't pertinent to this patient's situation.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and the high-risk of opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia, the addition of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for primary prophylaxis is indicated.\n\nReference:\n- US Department of Health and Human Services.

She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  Bactrim Dapsone Rifampin Trimethoprim alone Ceftriaxone\nThis is a case of HIV and suspected bacillary angiomatosis, based on the skin lesions and biopsy findings. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella species, typically B. henselae or B. quintana, and often seen in immunocompromised individuals like this patient.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis in this context would be Erythromycin, which is not listed among the options provided. However, we'll consider the closest and most suitable alternative based on typical treatments for this infection.\n\nAlthough Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is an antibiotic commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV patients, including toxoplasmosis and pneumocystis, it is not the first-line choice for bacillary angiomatosis.\n\nDapsone is an antimicrobial used as an alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in HIV patients who are sulfonamide allergic. However, it is not the preferred choice for treating bacillary angiomatosis.\n\nRifampin is usually reserved for treating tuberculosis and some bacterial biofilm-associated infections like prosthetic joint infections. It is not typically indicated for bacillary angiomatosis.\n\nTrimethoprim alone, without sulfamethoxazole, is not effective against Bartonella spp.\n\nCeftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic but is not indicated for treating bacillary angiomatosis.\n\nGiven these considerations, the closest acceptable answer among the options would be Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), despite not being the first-line choice for bacillary angiomatosis. This is because it has some bacteriostatic activity against Bartonella spp., and as there's no erythromycin in the provided options, it can at least be considered as a secondary therapeutic option until consultation with an infectious disease specialist for definitive treatment recommendations. Keep in mind that macrolides (eg, erythromycin) are the typical antibiotic class used to treat bacillary angiomatosis, however.\n\nSince the patient also has oral candidiasis (as indicated by white patches on her palate) and appears malnourished (BMI 19), an HIV specialist should be consulted promptly,\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week.

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?  After starting lamivudine, zidovudine, and didanosine (DDI) for HIV infection, which of the following complications is most likely to occur in this 35-year-old man?\nA) Pancreatitis\nB) Peripheral neuropathy\nC) Myelosuppression\nD) Mitochondrial toxicity\nAnswer: A) Pancreatitis\n\nReasoning: Didanosine (DDI) is known to cause pancreatitis, especially at higher doses or in patients with a history of pancreatitis. In this scenario, the patient was switched from indinavir to didanosine, increasing the risk of pancreatitis.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation:\n1. Indinavir, part of the initial regimen, is a protease inhibitor and is not typically associated with pancreatitis (so not the likely answer in the original scenario). However, it was replaced by didanosine.\n2. Didanosine (DDI), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is recognized for its adverse effect of pancreatitis, particularly at high doses or in individuals with prior pancreatitis episodes.\n3. After switching to didanosine, this patient now faces an increased risk for pancreatitis due to the medication alteration. Other options listed as potential side effects do not uniquely correspond to this new medication:\n   a. Peripheral neuropathy: While possible with didanosine, it's more commonly associated with stavudine (d4T) and less likely in comparison to pancreatitis as a side effect specific to DDI.\n   b. Myelosuppression: This is more commonly seen with zidovudine (AZT) and not uniquely linked to didanosine.\n   c. Mitochondrial toxicity: This is a general class effect for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as lamivudine, zidovudine, and didanosine; however, it's not specific to didanosine, and pancreatitis remains a more distinct side effect for this medication.\n\nTherefore, after starting didanosine, the 35-year-old man is at greatest risk for pancreatitis as a medication-related adverse effect.\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night.

B i.e. Primary CNS lymphoma Cerebral toxoplasmosisQ typically occurs in AIDS patients with CD4+ count < 100/mm3 (normal being > - 500/mm3) and have multifocal involvement. So it is unlikely in our patient with higher CD4+ count and a solitary lesion. Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastomas in contrast are commonly solitary lesions.

What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?Zidovudine for 6 weeks, aloneNevirapine aloneCombination prophylaxis for 6 weeks with zidovudine and lamivudine\nAnswer: C. Combination prophylaxis for 6 weeks with zidovudine and two other drugs (usually lamivudine and nevirapine) is recommended for infants born to mothers with detectable HIV viral load near delivery (678 copies/mL in this case), as per current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This regimen is designed to prevent perinatal HIV transmission.\n\nOption A, zidovudine alone for 6 weeks, is not sufficient for this infant. Although zidovudine monotherapy has been commonly used in the past, current guidelines recommend combination therapy for higher-risk infants like this one, born to a mother with detectable viral load at delivery.\n\nOption B, nevirapine alone, is not advisable for this setting. While nevirapine is often included in combination regimens for infant prophylaxis, using it as monotherapy would not follow current recommendations and may not effectively prevent transmission.\n\nPlease note that treatment strategies might vary depending on the local guidelines and recent research; however, based on the current widely accepted recommendations, combination prophylaxis including three antiretroviral drugs for 6 weeks, as described in Option C, is the most appropriate management choice for this infant. \n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman.
