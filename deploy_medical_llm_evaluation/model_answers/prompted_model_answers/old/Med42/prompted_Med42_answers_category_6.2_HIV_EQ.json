(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?  1) Corticosteroids 2) Erythromycin 3) Hydrocortisone 4) Fluconazole 5) Azithromycin\n\nCorrect: 1) Corticosteroids\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation suggests Cryptococcal meningitis, which is a severe and life-threatening infection common in immunocompromised individuals like those with AIDS. The lumbar puncture findings support this diagnosis. IV amphotericin B and oral flucytosine are appropriate first-line treatments for Cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn this scenario, corticosteroids (option 1) may be considered for additional acute management. High intracranial pressures (ICP) are frequent in Cryptococcal meningitis, and steroids, specifically dexamethasone, have been investigated as an adjunctive therapy for reducing these pressures and preventing secondary complications such as cerebral herniation. A randomized controlled trial (the COAT trial) suggested that dexamethasone use with induction antimicrobial therapy might improve outcomes in HIV-positive patients, particularly by reducing mortality due to cerebral oedema; however, the findings have not been uniformly applied in clinical practice and require specific patient selection factors (e.g., very high opening pressures), so they may not be indicated for every patient. Notably, this use of corticosteroids is for pressure management rather than immune suppression.\n\nThe other choices are incorrect in this specific context:\n- 2) Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic effective against certain bacterial infections but irrelevant in treating Cryptococcal meningitis or its complications.\n- 3) Hydrocortisone may have some role in septic shock in an immunocompromised patient, but it's not specifically indicated for managing Cryptococcal meningitis or its cerebral pressure complications compared to dexamethasone, which is more potent in reducing inflammation and edema.\n- 4) Fluconazole, an antifungal, could potentially be used later in the treatment course as step-down therapy after IV amphotericin B but doesn't address the acute need to control intracranial pressure or inflammation.\n- 5) Azithromycin is also an antibiotic (macrolide class, like erythromycin) and is not indicated in Cryptococcal meningitis treatment.\n\nRegarding Chloramphenicol from the previous patient scenario, it's an antibiotic used for bacterial infections; it does not cover fungal infections like Cryptococcus\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain.

The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?The posttest probability that a patient with a positive test result has the disease (AIDS). Positive Predictive Value = TRUE POSITIVESTRUE POSITIVES + FALSE POSITIVES Sensitivity = TRUE POSITIVESTRUE POSITIVES + FALSE NEGATIVES Specificity = TRUE NEGATIVESTRUE NEGATIVES + FALSE POSITIVES Negative Predictive Value (NPV)= TRUE NEGATIVESTRUE NEGATIVES + FALSE NEGATIVESYou want to know the Negative Predictive Value (NPV): TRUE NEGATIVESTRUE NEGATIVES + FALSE NEGATIVES From the data given, the number of True Negatives (TN) is 250 - 5 = 245, as 245 patients in the control arm who don not have AIDS tested negative on the screening. False Negatives (FN) represent individuals who have AIDS but tested negative. According to the given data, out of 250 AIDS patients, 240 tested positive, so 250 - 240 = 10 patients are False Negatives (FN).\n\nNow, plug these values into the NPV formula:\n\nNegative Predictive Value = TRUE NEGATIVES (TN) / (TRUE NEGATIVES (TN) + FALSE NEGATIVES (FN))\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV \u2248 0.96 or 96%\n\nHence, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96%. This means that for individuals who test negative on this screening, there is a 96% probability they do not have AIDS. However, note that it's essential to consider other factors like prevalence of the disease in the specific population being tested and additional external validation studies, to ensure the robustness of these results before applying them to clinical practice.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient? \nA: Given the patient's HIV status and symptom of sudden right-hand weakness, alongside elevated temperature and suboptimal medication adherence, a central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infection should be prioritized in the differential diagnosis. The most likely candidate in this scenario, considering local practice and context, is Toxoplasma gondii (cerebral toxoplasmosis), commonly encountered in immunocompromised patients like this individual.\nHowever, the empiric use of itraconazole, typically antifungal, would not cover Toxoplasma (which is a protozoan parasite). For CNS toxoplasmosis, the standard empiric therapy is a combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine (with leukovorin to minimize side effects) until a definitive diagnosis is established through imaging studies (e.g., MRI brain showing ring-enhancing lesions) and possibly lumbar puncture for CSF analysis.\nThe fact that his father had a myocardial infarction and mother a stroke could suggest a background familial risk of cerebrovascular diseases, but given the patient's immunocompromised state and unilateral neurological symptoms, infection, specifically toxoplasmosis, is more likely at this juncture. Anyvascular causes might also be evaluated but are secondary considerations in this case.\nDespite the patient's hypertension and cardiovascular family history, his acute presentation and risk profile suggest infection over acute cerebrovascular events at this point.\n\nBibliography:\n1.

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe right answer for this medical question is: Progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nExplanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a demyelinating disorder commonly seen in HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromised states caused by JC virus.\n\nKey diagnostic features:\n1. Subacute onset and progression of neurological symptoms, including weakness, ataxia, and cognitive decline.\n2. Non-enhancing white matter lesions on MRI consistent with demyelination and lacking mass effect.\n3. Low CD4+ count (<200/\u03bcL, in this case 56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (>100,000 copies/mL), indicating severe immunosuppression.\n4. Exclusion of alternative causes, such as toxoplasmosis (positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG merely indicates past exposure, not an active infection in these symptoms' context) and cryptococcal disease (negative cryptococcal antigen).\n\nVascular dementia, the suggested answer based on past cases, is less likely given the patient's MRI findings showing disseminated white matter lesions without any mass effect or vascular abnormality, along with his age (44 years) and the rapid progression of symptoms.\nOther considerations such as primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) might be entertained given immunosuppression, but the imaging characteristics with lack of enhancement argue against PCNSL, which typically presents with contrast-enhancing lesions. \n\nTreatment for PML focuses on immune reconstitution by starting or optimizing combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to manage HIV infection, and no specific antiviral therapy against JC virus is currently available. Supportive care for symptoms and monitoring for related complications, like seizures, is essential. However, PML remains associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially when the CD4+ count remains low or HIV viremia is not well-controlled. The prognosis may vary depending on the extent of central nervous system involvement and immune reconstitution after initiating cART. Nonetheless, PML remains the most likely diagnosis given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.\ufffd \n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls.

Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit? The correct answer to this question is: c. HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends testing for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae for all pregnant women. Although she tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago, it is important to repeat these tests during pregnancy because the patient may have been exposed to these infections since her last testing. Routine testing for Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 is not recommended by ACOG or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Serum TSH testing is done for pregnant women with a history of thyroid disease or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, as well as in women with a family history of thyroid disorders. CMV serology is not routinely recommended in pregnant women, but it may be done if there is a concern for congenital CMV infection based on the patient's exposure, such as working in a daycare center or having a child in daycare. PCR for HSV-2 is not a routine prenatal test, but it may be done in women with a history of genital herpes or lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during pregnancy. So, in this scenario, the tests that should be done at this prenatal visit are HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Routine testing for these infections is recommended by ACOG and CDC to prevent maternal transmission and to ensure the health of the mother and fetus.  1. Cohn A et al.

When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? 1) Fluconazole, 2) Clarithromycin, 3) Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole\nThe correct answer to the question is: 3) Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole\n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven the patient's severely suppressed CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and known non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for six months, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. In this setting, primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as PCP) is essential. The standard medication for PJP prophylaxis is Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole, a fixed-dose combination of sulfonamide antibiotics.\nFluconazole, although commonly used as an antifungal, is not specifically indicated for prophylaxis in this case but might be later considered if candidiasis develops or for secondary prophylaxis after successfully treated invasive candidiasis in severely immunosuppressed patients.\nClarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is used for prophylaxis of Mycobacterium avium complex infections, typically in patients with CD4+ < 50 cells/mm3 for long durations (often persistent across months or years) or who've had prior MAC disease. However, in this scenario, the priority is PJP prophylaxis, and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole is the preferred choice.\n\nAfter starting the patient on prophylactic Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and re-initiating ART, close monitoring and supportive care for depression would also be critical in enhancing medication adherence and overall health outcomes. Additionally, the patient should be evaluated for other potential opportunistic infections given his immunosuppressed state. The entire HIV care team, including primary care, infectious diseases, and behavioral health, should collaborate to manage the case comprehensively.\n    Target answer: In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care.

She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  -Caspofungin\n-Doxycycline\n-Erythromycin\n-Streptomycin\n-Trimephoprim-sulfamethoxane\n-Vancomycin\n\nThe correct answer for this biomedical question is: Trimephoprim-sulfamethoxane\n\nJustification: The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis, a bacteremia resulting from infection with either Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. In HIV patients with severely depressed CD4+ counts, such as this individual, this disease typically presents with fever, weight loss, and multiple skin lesions consisting of vascular proliferations, as confirmed by Warthin-Starry stain indicating intracellular bacterial aggregates called \"clusters of bacilli.\"\nGiven the hospital's longstanding use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, it implies that Toxoplasma gondii or Pneumocystis jirovecii infections may be common in their HIV patient population, but these antimicrobials are not indicated for bacillary angiomatosis. The treatment of choice for bacillary angiomatosis in HIV-infected individuals is generally a combination of antibiotics that includes a sulfa compound due to excellent in vitro activity. In this case, the appropriate choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxane, taking into account the possible drug interactions and side effects carefully. Doxycycline can be considered as an alternative if sulfa sensitivity is suspected but is less favored as monotherapy.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to treating bacillary angiomatosis. Caspofungin, vancomycin, and streptomycin are ineffective against Bartonella infection. Erythromycin has limited antibacterial activity in bacillary angiomatosis, although some sources suggest it could be used as a less preferred agent, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to sulfonamides.\n\nKeep in mind that the management should also address the patient's overall health status, including potential coinfections, nutritional deficiencies, and substance use disorders, as well as adherence to antiretroviral therapy for her HIV infection.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week.

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?\u00a0\nLet's think about this step-by-step. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).\nReasoning:\n1. History: The patient has HIV, with inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the recent past, making him immunocompromised. This predisposes him to opportunistic infections or malignancies, such as PCNSL.\n2. Imaging: The solitary, ring-enhancing brain lesion on MRI is a classic sign for PCNSL, though it can also mimic a brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, or, less likely, glioblastoma in an immunocompromised host. However, glioblastoma is less likely in this case due to its ring-enhancing nature and association with corpus callosum involvement, which is more typical for PCNSL in HIV patients.\n3. Cerebrospinal fluid findings: The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid strongly supports a diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is closely linked to the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS.\n4. Clinical features: The patient's neurological examination showing ataxia and apathy, combined with a low Mini-Mental State Examination score, suggests cognitive impairment consistent with a diffuse brain process like PCNSL, which can infiltrate and affect multiple regions.\n5. Differential diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis is another possible diagnosis given the patient's HIV status, but the positive EBV PCR result, imaging characteristics, and clinical presentation strongly argue for PCNSL. Brain abscesses are also less likely due to single lesion presentation and the absence of fever, leukocytosis, or hypoglycorrhachia (low cerebrospinal fluid glucose). Glioblastoma is unlikely in this case because of the immunocompromised state, EBV findings, and characteristic imaging.\nIn conclusion, primary central nervous system lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis, supported by the patient's HIV/AIDS background, MRI findings, cerebrospinal fluid analysis detecting EBV, and clinical presentation.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks.

The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant? \nA. Start zidovudine for 6 weeks to prevent vertical transmission.\nB. Obtain consent for HIV-1 PCR assay\nC. Administer triple antiretroviral therapy for 2 weeks to the infant\nD. Begin IVIG prophylaxis against HIV infection \nE. Discharge the infant and mother home after 24-48 hours after birth. \n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. Because maternal viral load was detectable at delivery, the infant is at increased risk for HIV infection. The antepartum and intrapartum use of triple antiretroviral therapy by the mother significantly decreased the risk of vertical transmission but does not eliminate it. Therefore, post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant is still recommended. The most appropriate regimen for this infant is zidovudine 4 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 6 weeks. This recommendation is supported by the data from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) trials on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. So, the correct answer is: a. Start zidovudine for 6 weeks to prevent vertical transmission. Triple antiretroviral therapy for 2 weeks is unnecessary for a term infant born to a mother with undetectable viral load or a low viral load, as this option was. Obtaining consent for an HIV-1 PCR assay is necessary but is not an immediate priority in the care of this newborn. The infant may be discharged from the hospital after a 24- to 48-hour observation period (option E), but this step should not be taken until a plan for antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis has been established. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (option D) does not have a role in the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV. Reference: Paediatrics; A Concise Text, 2nd edition, page 164. So, the correct answer is: a. Start zidovudine for 6 weeks to prevent vertical transmission.  18.
