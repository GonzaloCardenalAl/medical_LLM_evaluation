Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?  \nA) Primary CNS lymphoma\nB) Multifocal varicella-zoster leukoencephalitis\nC) CMV encephalitis\nD) HIV encephalopathy\nE) Cerebral abscess  \n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. The presence of a mass lesion on MRI in an HIV-infected individual is suggestive of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), toxoplasmosis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) points towards lymphoma. PCNSL in HIV-infected patients usually presents with a solitary lesion. It is the most common CNS neoplasm in HIV-infected individuals. This lymphoma is thought to result from EBV-induced polyclonal B-lymphocyte proliferation. It usually occurs in association with low CD4+ count, and unlike non-HIV PCNSL, it frequently involves the posterior fossa and periventricular region.\n\nVaricella-zoster leukoencephalitis presents as a multifocal (not solitary) white matter disease due to infection of white matter by varicella-zoster virus. CMV encephalitis presents with diffuse ventriculitis, prominent ependymitis, and hemorrhagic periventricular lesions on MRI, not solitary ring-enhancing lesion. HIV encephalopathy is a non-focal disease with diffuse white matter abnormalities. Cerebral abscess is a less likely option given the absence of fever and focal signs other than confusion, and usually, brain abscess would not preferentially involve the corpus callosum. So, the correct answer is: a. Primary CNS lymphoma \n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion.

What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?\u00a0\nA. Maraviroc\nB. Enfuvirtide\nC. Ritonavir\nD. Indinavir\nE. Nelfinavir\nLet's think about this step-by-step. Enfuvirtide, a fuzeon inhibitor, acts by binding to the gp41 subunit of HIV envelope glycoprotein causing inhibition of viral fusion. Ritonavir, Indinavir, Nelfinavir are protease inhibitors so they would not be the correct answer. Ref: Harrisons Principles of Internal medicine, 18th Edition, Chapter 189 So, the correct answer is: b. Enfuvirtide  11     Explanation:  Ans is 'b' i.e., Enfuvirtide * Fuzeon (Enfuvirtide; T-20) is the first approved fusion inhibitor. It is 36-amino-acid synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane 1 (TMl) domain of gp41 and blocks the interaction between the N-terminal heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and the C-terminal HR2. Consequently, fuzeon prevents 6-helix bundle formation and insertion of 14-15 unpaired HR2 hydrophobic 1 13 residues into the target cell membrane. As such, fuzeon prevents the fusion 14 event and therefore virus entry into 15 the target cell. Fuzeon is active against 16 all group M 17 (major) HIV-1 18 subtypes ( 19 Clade A-G). Fuzeon should be 20 combined with other active antiretroviral 21 agents in patients 22 who have 23 multiclass 24 drug resistance 25 to gain 26 30 maximal 31 long-term 32 clinical 33 benefit. * Maraviroc (MC 251) is a CCR5 receptor antagonist (blocker) acts by blocking HIV-1 entry into host cells because it binds selectively and reversibly to the host chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a co-receptor for HIV-1. As a result, maraviroc prevents CCR5 tropic HIV-1 entry into the cell, but presumably 15 allows 16 the 17 immune system 18 to 19 function in 20 an 21 otherwise 22 intact 23 manner. * All currently approved PIs are active against HIV-1 1 and HIV-2 2. All of the PIs\n    Target answer: The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters.

She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed? \nA. Oxidative deamination\nB. Aldolase reaction \nC. Decarboxylation \nD. Hydroxylation \nE. Oxidation \n\nFor this question, we need to understand the effects of overheating on Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in formula. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin essential for healthy growth and immune function in infants. When formula is overheated, as in prolonged boiling beyond what's necessary for sterilization, it can lead to degradation of Vitamin C through oxidation reactions.\nHere, the correct answer is E. Oxidation. Overheating formula can accelerate the oxidation of Vitamin C, turning it into dehydroascorbic acid or, further, into 2,3-diketogulonate, which are inactive and cannot provide their essential nutritional benefits to the infant. Proper sterilization techniques (e.g., flash heating) that avoid excessive heat are recommended for formula preparation in order to preserve Vitamin C.\n\nAldolase reaction (B) is an enzymatic process involved in carbohydrate metabolism within cells. It's not related to Vitamin C degradation in heated formula.\nDecarboxylation (C) is a reaction that removes carbon dioxide from molecules, often in cellular respiration processes. It doesn't apply here.\nOxidative deamination (A) is a process in amino acid metabolism, whereby an amino group is removed, which isn't connected to Vitamin C degradation due to overheating.\nHydroxylation (D) is a reaction that adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) to molecules, common in various metabolic pathways. It's not related to Vitamin C inactivation in overheated formula.\n\nIn summary, overheating the formula leads to the oxidation of Vitamin C, impairing its nutritional value for the infant. This is why the physician recommends not overheating the formula during sterilization processes.\n    Target answer: If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired.\n    Background Question: A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago.

She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment? Which HIV medication likely contributed to the development of acute pancreatitis?\nThe answer to this question is: After she recovers from acute pancreatitis, didanosine should be discontinued or avoided due to its known association with pancreatitis. The other medications in her combination therapy (zidovudine and efavirenz) are not commonly linked to pancreatitis.\nAlthough all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have a slight risk of pancreatitis, didanosine (ddl) has the highest risk amongst all NRTIs, including zidovudine (ZDV). NRTIs work by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase, preventing the integration of the virus' genetic material into host cells. However, didanosine's increased propensity to crystallize in the pancreatic ducts, likely due to its structural properties and higher doses required, might contribute to its increased risk for pancreatitis.\n\nEfavirenz, being a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is not associated with pancreatitis. These agents directly bind the reverse transcriptase enzyme, preventing its function without undergoing intracellular conversion, unlike NRTIs.\n\nIn conclusion, didanosine (ddl) is the medication that likely contributed to the development of acute pancreatitis in this patient, given her recent HIV treatment initiation and known side effects of didanosine. Following recovery, replacing didanosine with other NRTI alternatives, such as lamivudine or abacavir, or even changing the treatment class to protease inhibitors or integrase inhibitors, will lower the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. However, it is crucial to consult treatment guidelines and a healthcare professional for individualized management to ensure best practices in HIV care with minimized toxicity.\n    Target answer: After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit.

Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease.

The humoral response to HIV involves the production of antibodies against the viral envelope proteins, which consist of gp120 (surface protein) and gp41 (transmembrane protein). Of the options listed, this leaves either gp120 (F) or gp41 (C) as the target of a new antibody. gp120 mediates viral entry and is exposed on the outside of the virus at various stages in its life cycle. gp41, which forms a complex with gp120 and mediates viral entry by fusion of the HIV and host cell membranes, is only exposed extracellularly briefly during HIV entry. An antibody against gp120 would likely be the best option to interfere with viral entry, as it could bind gp120 at various stages of the viral life cycle, including the initial binding of gp120 to CD4 and coreceptor. An antibody targeting gp41 may only be able to interfere with viral entry, and not other stages of the HIV life cycle. So, the correct answer is: F. gp120 \n    Target answer: The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120.\n    Background Question: A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV.

Aspergillus fumigatus\n\nExplanation: In the provided clinical scenario, the patient has a compromised immune system due to HIV, which makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The symptoms of fever and hemoptysis, combined with a fibrocavitary lesion on chest radiograph, are consistent with an invasive fungal infection. Aspergillus fumigatus, a common opportunistic fungus, causes invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. Histopathology revealing septate hyphae branching at acute angles confirms this diagnosis, as these features are characteristic of Aspergillus species.\n \nThe other options can be excluded:\n\na. Pneumocystis jirovecii: This organism classically causes diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph rather than cavitations. It would not exhibit septate hyphae on biopsy.\n\nc.

This is particularly concerning in our patient who has HIV, as immunosuppressed individuals are more susceptible to hematological complications.\n- Zidovudine, one of his antiretroviral drugs, also has the potential to cause bone marrow suppression leading to anemia and neutropenia. Thus, adding valganciclovir will further increase this patient's risk of these adverse effects due to potential synergy or additive toxicity.\n- There is no specific evidence linking valganciclovir (or this antiretroviral regimen) to hyperglycemia (B), hypercalcemia (C), rhabdomyolysis (D), or hemorrhage (E). None of these choices constitute the most common or significant risk arising from valganciclovir addition in this scenario.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient's complete blood count (CBC) closely post-initiation of valganciclovir to promptly address any hematological issues as they arise. Adjustments in dosing or switching to an alternative medication might be necessary if severe hematological adverse effects occur. Additionally, supportive care, such as blood component transfusion, might be required to manage severe anemia or neutropenia.\n    Target answer: Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia.\n    Background Question: A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?A. HIV antibody test immediately after delivery B. P24 antigen assay performed on cord blood immediately after deliveryC. PCR for HIV DNA performed on cord blood immediately after deliveryD. HIV ELISAE. Viral culture of breast milk\n\nA. Incorrect - This is not appropriate as the newborn would show a positive antibody test which may not necessarily reflect true infection but rather passive transfer of maternal antibody\nB. Incorrect - While P24 antigen assay can detect viral presence, it has low sensitivity in newborns.\nC. Correct - PCR for HIV DNA has a sensitivity approaching 100% within 1-2 days of life and allows for early testing and prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the neonate.\nD. Incorrect - HIV ELISA would again detect antibodies, not the virus itself.\nE. Incorrect - Viral culture of breast milk is not a diagnostic test for HIV infection in the newborn. \n\nThe WHO recommends early detection and treatment of infants born to HIV-positive women. The preferred method is nucleic acid amplification tests like PCR, carried out as soon as possible after birth and again at 4-6 weeks, with a final test at 12-18 months to confirm seroconversion. \n\nThe key takeaway here is that maternal antibodies would persist in the newborn's blood for several months, but a positive PCR test would confirm the presence of the HIV virus in the infant, rather than just the transferred antibodies. Therefore, PCR for HIV DNA performed on cord blood immediately after delivery is the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient's concern about her baby's infection status. \n    Target answer: The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA.\n    Background Question: A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care.

He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician? \nA) Maintain confidentiality\nB) Disclose his HIV status to his wife\nC) Contact local public health authorities\nD) Ask the patient's wife to obtain HIV testing\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. **The correct answer is C) Contact local public health authorities**\n\nIn this situation, the physician has a duty to balance patient confidentiality with the potential harm to the patient's wife. While maintaining confidentiality is essential, there are exceptions, such as when there's a significant risk of harm to others.\n\nThe patient's HIV status poses a significant risk to his wife, and disclosing his diagnosis to her would be ideal. However, the patient has explicitly requested confidentiality, making direct disclosure challenging.\n\nContacting local public health authorities (Option C) is the most appropriate next step. Public health officials can initiate partner notification and testing services while maintaining the patient's anonymity. This approach respects the patient's confidentiality while ensuring his wife's safety and promoting public health.\n\nIt's essential to note that directly disclosing the patient's HIV status to his wife (Option B) without his consent would violate confidentiality. Similarly, asking the patient's wife to obtain HIV testing (Option D) without providing context or explanation could lead to unnecessary anxiety and may not result in her getting tested promptly.\n\nMaintaining confidentiality (Option A) alone would not adequately address the risk to the patient's wife and would not fulfill the physician's duty to prevent harm.\n\nIn summary, contacting local public health authorities is the best course of action, as it balances confidentiality with the need to protect the patient's wife and the broader community.\n    Target answer: The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination.

Positive serum cryptococcal antigen with a titer >1:5\nB. Positive CSF stain for acid-fast bacilli\nC. Positive CSF bacterial culture for gram-positive diplococci\nD. Positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The above clinical presentation and light microscopy findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, which is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in HIV-positive individuals with severe immunosuppression. In cryptococcal meningitis, the CSF typically shows increased protein, decreased glucose, and pleocytosis (lymphocyte predominance). Staining with India ink reveals encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds characteristic of Cryptococcus species. Given this diagnosis:\n\n- A positive serum cryptococcal antigen test with a high titer (>1:5) would be expected, as it is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing cryptococcal infections, including meningitis.\n- Options B, C, and D are not relevant to this case:\n  - Acid-fast bacilli are seen in tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), not Cryptococcus.\n  - Gram-positive diplococci are characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, not Cryptococcus.\n  - Epstein-Barr virus serology is irrelevant for diagnosing cryptococcal meningitis, as it causes other diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis.\n    Target answer: A latex agglutination test specific for Cryptococcal meningitis would also be expected in this patient.\n    Background Question: A 41-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a 4-day history of headaches and nuchal rigidity.
