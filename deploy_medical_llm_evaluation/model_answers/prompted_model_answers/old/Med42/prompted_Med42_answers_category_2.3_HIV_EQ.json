I know this may be tough for you guys -- it's an old question -- but if anyone has the answer, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nTo provide context, the treatment of HIV was still in its infancy back in 1990, and only a handful or so of antiretroviral drugs were approved and available at the time. In fact, only two or three antiretroviral drugs had been approved for use by 1990, and monotherapy (using a single antiretroviral drug) was the norm.\n\nI did manage to dig up some information on antiretroviral drugs approved during that time period. Namely, zidovudine (AZT) was approved in 1987, didanosine (ddI) in 1991, and zalcitabine (ddC) in 1992. These were part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) family, which worked by mimicking nucleosides and interfering with viral reverse transcription. Stavudine (d4T), another NRTI, was also approved in 1994. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) began to emerge later, with nevirapine being approved in 1996 and efavirenz in 1998.\n\nAlthough it's clear that the options were quite limited in 1990, I did come across a few hints suggesting possible regimens during that time. One source mentioned the use of AZT monotherapy as a standard treatment practice in the early 1990s, referencing a major AIDS clinical trial (ACTG 002) that concluded in 1990. ACTG 002 compared 300 mg of AZT twice daily to 1500 mg once daily and demonstrated the efficacy and better tolerability of the lower dosage.\n\nHowever, my search could not confirm whether any combination therapies consisting of more than one antiretroviral drug were routinely administered in 1990 Switzerland. Although a landmark trial called ACTG 116A, initiated in late 1989, was investigating the potential benefits of combining AZT with ddI, the trial's results were not published until 1992. \n\nWith this background information in mind, it appears that zidovudine (AZT) as monotherapy would likely have been the predominant treatment choice in Switzerland in 1990, given its prior approval and established effectiveness. However, I'm still unsure whether other antiretroviral drugs\n    Target answer: The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

We hypothesized that HIV status, immigration background and other markers for social disadvantage (lower education, living in single person households) affect the birth rate among women in Switzerland.\nMethods: We used data of women aged 15-49 from the Swiss federal census 2010 and Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) database. We compared age-specific birth rates and total birth rates between HIV-positive women with a SHCS registration (N = 404) and a representative sample of non-HIV-affected Swiss women from the federal census (N = 2 000).\nResults: The total birth rate of HIV-positive women was 2.6, compared to 1.5 for non-HIV-affected women (p<0.001). Age-specific birth rates showed similar trends but were lower for non-HIV-affected women in all age groups. Within the HIV-positive group, women born in Switzerland, with higher education, and/or in couple households showed a significantly lower birth rate than their counterparts born in sub-Saharan Africa, with lower education, and/or living alone (p <0.001).\nConclusion: Swiss HIV-positive women had a higher birth rate than non-HIV-affected women in 2010, with marked social disparities and a substantial effect of immigration background.\nHIV, birth rate, social determinants, Swiss Census, Swiss HIV Cohort Study\nThe HIV epidemic among women is rising in Western countries, with women representing approximately 50% of new infections in Switzerland, mostly acquired through heterosexual contact [1]. Due to better availability and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its effect on viral load, the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child (MTCT) during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding has decreased dramatically [2, 3].\nDespite this, HIV-affected women still face considerable social stigmatization, especially regarding reproduction [4].

A comparison using surveillance data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office\n\nResearch output: Contribution to journalArticle (Academic Journal)\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: Mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Switzerland is effectively prevented. Consequently, HIV infection does not necessarily preclude women from having children, but might contribute to reduced fertility due to a range of health and socioeconomic factors associated with HIV. This study aimed to compare birth rates between women living with HIV and the general female population in Switzerland in 2020.\n\nDesign: Cross-sectional observational study using data from a large, prospective, multicentre, cohort study of people living with HIV in Switzerland (the Swiss HIV Cohort Study) and population data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.\n\nMethods: Births to women with HIV and their characteristics were extracted from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study database and compared with corresponding figures for the general Swiss female population.\n\nResults: In 2020, women with HIV (n=3,450) contributed 0.43% (90/20,787) of all births in Switzerland. A birth rate of 26.10 (95%CI 23.34\u201329.15) per 1,000 person-years was found among women with HIV compared with 63.8 per 1,000 person-years reported for the general female population (Relative Risk=0.40 (95%CI 0.35\u20130.46). Furthermore, women with HIV were more likely to be older (\u226535 years) and more likely to have a higher body mass index at childbirth. Similar proportions of HIV-affected women and the general female population delivered via caesarean section (23.3% vs 31.3%, p=0.08) and reported preterm births (10.0% vs 8.8%, p=0.65).\n\nConclusion: Births among women living with HIV in Switzerland in 2020 corresponded to only 1 in 230 births of the general female population, with an approximately 60% lower birth rate. This is likely due to a range of factors such as late presentation, delayed childbearing, a higher risk of infertility, and socioeconomic barriers associated with living with HIV. The similarity in rates of preterm birth and caesarean section delivery between infected and non-infected women was reassuring, despite the presence of advanced maternal age and obesity among HIV-infected women, highlighting the importance of access to antenatal care and the quality of obstetric care in Switzerland.\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

HIV Infections\nHIV Infection can occur in Switzerland via different routes, but the most common source is sexual contact. Here's a breakdown of the main transmission categories in Switzerland, based on data from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH):\n\n1. **Sexual contact**: This is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Switzerland, accounting for approximately 85-90% of new infections. Specifically, men having sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected, making up around 60-70% of all new HIV diagnoses. Heterosexual transmission also occurs, although at a lower frequency.\n2. **Injection drug use**: Sharing contaminated needles or syringes among people who inject drugs accounts for around 5-10% of new HIV infections in Switzerland.\n3. **Mother-to-child transmission**: Although rare in Switzerland due to effective prevention measures, mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding still occurs in some cases, constituting about 1-2% of new infections.\n4. **Other transmission routes**: Blood transfusions, organ transplants, and occupational exposure are extremely rare sources of HIV transmission in Switzerland, as rigorous safety protocols and screening measures are in place to minimize these risks.\n\nTo summarize, the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland is through **sexual contact**, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Safe sex practices, regular testing, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are crucial for preventing HIV transmission in this population.\n    Target answer: The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use.\n    Background Question: What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Guilt and shame are common psychosocial experiences for PLWH across regions and societies, and often result from prevalent, deep-rooted negative social norms or beliefs about HIV infection\nTo find this, I looked for a cross-sectional study that recruited participants at least in one continent to measure the proportion of PLWH experiencing guilt because of their infection. Unfortunately, I am only able to find studies from Africa (2020) and UK (2017), none of which report \"guilt\" as a dependent variable.\nI found a systematic review titled The impact of shame and guilt on the well-being of people living with HIV (January 2020), which identified 12 articles for inclusion. However, upon reading through the 12 studies, I again could not find the prevalence of guilt in PLWH.\n\nIs there any other way to determine the proportion of PLWH experiencing guilt in 2020?\n\n\u2022\nCross references:\n\nLemly, D., Tompkins, T.

They will select a response from the following options, for example, using a Likert scale:\n1 - Strongly disagree\n2 - Somewhat disagree\n3 - Neither agree nor disagree\n4 - Somewhat agree\n5 - Strongly agree\nThe proportion of PWH who consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts' will be calculated by summing up the responses of option 4 (Somewhat agree) and option 5 (Strongly agree) and dividing that by the total number of responses, then multiplying by 100.\nThis proportion would ideally be zero or close to zero, indicating that there is minimal stigma and discrimination experienced by People living with HIV in the society.\n\nExample: \nIn 2020, a monitoring survey was conducted among 500 People living with HIV in country X.\nOut of the 500 respondents, 85 chose option 4 (Somewhat agree) and 50 chose option 5 (Strongly agree).\nProportion = (85 + 50) / 500 * 100 \u2248 27%\nSo, in country X in 2020, approximately 27% of People living with HIV considered that they are treated like outcasts.\n\nThis indicator reflects one aspect of social barriers that People living with HIV might encounter in accessing and adhering to HIV care and treatment. High proportions might indicate a need to address and combat stigma and discrimination in the country or region. However, it is essential to remember that multiple indicators and data sources should be considered and triangulated to capture the full picture of the challenges faced by PWH. \n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200? \n\nA few reasons I'm asking this:\n\n1. Research Focus: This question delves into the potential differences in HIV disease progression based on age at the time of initial diagnosis. Understanding these differences can provide valuable insights for clinicians and researchers working in HIV management, particularly in contexts where early diagnosis and treatment initiation might be most critical, such as in pediatric and young adult populations.\n2. Immune System Maturation: The human immune system undergoes significant changes between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Variations in immune maturation could theoretically influence how rapidly HIV compromises CD4 counts. Comparing CD4 decline rates between those diagnosed before versus after age 20 might reveal age-specific patterns, which could have implications for the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation.\n3. Adherence and Treatment Outcomes: Younger individuals diagnosed with HIV may have different adherence profiles or social contexts affecting their health care engagement compared to older individuals. Delays or difficulties in adhering to treatment regimens could result in slower time to ART initiation or suboptimal viral suppression, which could impact CD4 count trajectories. This query aims to determine whether these differences are reflected in the speed of CD4 decline.\n4. Historical Context: The period between 1990 and 2010 witnessed significant advancements in HIV treatment and care, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and changes in treatment guidelines. By restricting the analysis to this historical context, we can better understand the possible age-specific variation in CD4 cell decline prior to the widespread adoption of today's more aggressive \"test-and-treat\" and \"treat-all\" strategies.\n\nTo address this question, a retrospective cohort study could be conducted using existing HIV databases or clinical records from clinics known for managing pediatric and young adult HIV patients, as well as from adult clinics providing care to this population diagnosed during the specified period. Inclusion criteria would be an initial positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010, age documented at testing (either <20 or \u226520 years), and an initial CD4 count above 300 cells/\u03bcL. The primary outcome would be time from HIV diagnosis to the first recorded CD4 count below 200 cells/\u03bcL, censoring for death or loss to follow-up. Potential covariates, such as sex, baseline viral load, and time to ART initiation, should be accounted for using appropriate statistical methods.\n\nKeep in mind that my analysis would only apply to untreated individuals (i.e., those who did not start ART\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
