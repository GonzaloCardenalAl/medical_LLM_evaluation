If the HIV antibody test is positive, the test is usually repeated to confirm the diagnosis. If ELISA and western blot tests are indeterminate, the results are considered to be inconclusive, rather than negative.\nHow do you know if you have HIV? The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. Knowing your HIV status gives you powerful information so you can take steps to keep yourself and your partner(s) healthy: If you test positive, you can take medicine to treat HIV. If you test negative, you have more prevention tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV? People with HIV may experience different symptoms at the various stages of the disease. Early signs of HIV infection may be mild and easily dismissed. But even without noticeable symptoms, an HIV-infected person can still pass the virus on to others. That\u2019s because they can still have high levels of HIV circulating in their system.\nWhat are the signs of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later. Next, the HIV virus weakens your body\u2019s immune system. As the immune system weakens, you are at risk of serious illnesses. See your doctor if you have these signs of HIV infection:\nWhat is the treatment for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but HIV medicines (called antiretrovirals or ARVs) can prevent or reverse damage to the immune system. They also reduce the risk of developing AIDS related cancers and can prevent onward transmission of HIV. HIV treatment involves taking highly effective medication to reduce the amount of virus in the body to undetectable levels. This is called viral suppression. If you have HIV, taking HIV medication (known as antiretroviral therapy or ART) can help you live a longer, healthier life and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. Before you start HIV treatment you\u2019ll need to see a HIV specialist to talk about your treatment options.\nHow is HIV treated? HIV treatment involves taking medicines that slow the progression of the virus in your body. HIV is a type of virus called a retrovirus, and the combination of drugs used to treat it is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is recommended for all people living with HIV, regardless of how long they\u2019ve had the virus or how healthy they are. ART can\u2019t cure HIV, but it can help you stay healthy for many years, and it greatly reduces your chance of giving HIV to anyone else.\nHow is HIV transmitted? HIV is spread through contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV. These fluids include:\nHow can you prevent HIV? You can take steps to protect yourself from HIV infection, including:\nHow can you protect yourself from HIV? You can reduce the risk of spreading HIV by:\nWhat are the stages of HIV? The three stages of HIV infection are (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Acute HIV infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph glands, inflammation of the throat, rash, muscle pain, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The chronic HIV stage typically has no symptoms and can last for years if not treated with HIV medication. AIDS, the severe phase of HIV infection, occurs when the immune system is severely damaged and a person becomes vulnerable to opportunistic infections.\nWhat are the stages of HIV infection?

AIDS, the severe phase of HIV infection, occurs when the immune system is severely damaged and a person becomes vulnerable to opportunistic infections.\nWhat is HIV? HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment. If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\nWhat is HIV and how is it transmitted?

It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Babies born to HIV-infected women may become infected before or during birth or through breast-feeding after birth.\nHow is HIV not transmitted? HIV is not spread by:\nCasual contact\nDonating blood\nMosquitoes or other insects\nSaliva, tears, or sweat\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS? Some people who contract HIV experience flu-like symptoms within a month or two after infection, but possible symptoms include:\nFever (raised body temperature)\nSwollen glands (lymph nodes)\nAchy muscles and joints\nSore throat, headache, and/or rash\nThese symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. During this period of infection, HIV is present in large quantities in genital fluids and blood and the virus can easily be passed to others. However, some people may be infected and have no symptoms. In either case, without proper treatment, the infection will progress and, on average, will cause the onset of AIDS in about 10 years.\nHow can you tell if you are infected with HIV? The only way to determine for sure whether you are infected is to be tested for HIV infection. You cannot rely on symptoms to know whether or not you are infected. Many people who are infected with HIV do not have any symptoms at all for 10 years or more.\nWhat is the \u201cwindow period\u201d for HIV infection? After you get infected, it can take some time for your body to make enough antibodies to be detected by an HIV test. This is called the \u201cwindow period\u201d between the time of the infection and the point when the test will show that you are infected. The window period can vary from person to person. Most people will develop detectable antibodies within 2 to 8 weeks (the average is 25 days). Even so, there is a chance that some individuals will take longer to develop detectable antibodies. Therefore, if the initial negative HIV test was conducted within the first 3 months after possible exposure, repeat testing should be considered >3 months after the exposure occurred to account for the possibility of a false-negative result. Ninety-seven percent of persons will develop antibodies in the first 3 months following the time of their infection. In very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months to develop antibodies to HIV.\nHow can I tell if I\u2019m infected with HIV? The only way to know if you are infected is to be tested for HIV infection. You cannot rely on symptoms to know whether or not you are infected. Many people who are infected with HIV do not have any symptoms at all for 10 years or more. Some people who are infected will have some \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms soon after infection\u2014like fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes (mild symptoms and those of other diseases). Other people have no symptoms at all. The symptoms of HIV infection go away within a few weeks. Just because symptoms go away doesn\u2019t mean the infection is gone. The only way to know whether you are infected is to be tested for HIV.\nWhat are the treatments for HIV? There are medical treatments that can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, but currently there is no cure for HIV. However, there are other treatments that can prevent or cure the conditions associated with HIV infection.\nWhat can you do to prevent HIV infection? The only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to be tested. CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 years get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. Knowing your HIV status gives you powerful information to help you take steps to keep you and your partner healthy.\nFor people who are HIV-negative and vulnerable to getting HIV, there is a daily medicine called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that can be taken to prevent HIV. PrEP is for people without HIV who are at very high risk for getting it from sex or injection drug use. PrEP is safe but some people experience side effects like diarrhea, nausea, headache, fatigue, and stomach pain. These side effects usually go away over time.\nIf you are HIV-negative but have an HIV-positive partner, talk to your doctor about PrEP. If you don\u2019t know your partner\u2019s HIV status, talk to your partner and ask them to get tested.\nPrEP is a powerful HIV prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. But people who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug every day and seeing their health care provider for follow-up every 3 months.\nFor people living with HIV, there is a daily pill called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that can make the level of virus very low (called viral suppression or\n    Target answer: HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids.

It is important to use condoms correctly and consistently to ensure maximum protection.\nGetting tested: It is important to get tested for HIV regularly, especially if you are sexually active or have had unprotected sex. Knowing your HIV status can help you take steps to protect yourself and others.\nPracticing safe sex: In addition to using condoms, practicing safe sex can help to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. This includes avoiding high-risk behaviors, such as having multiple sexual partners or sharing needles.\nAvoiding sharing needles: Sharing needles or other injection equipment can increase the risk of HIV transmission. It is important to avoid sharing needles or other injection equipment to prevent the spread of HIV and other blood-borne infections.\nTaking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): PrEP is a medication that can be taken by people who are at high risk of HIV infection to help prevent the virus from taking hold in the body. PrEP is highly effective when taken as directed and can help to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.\nGetting vaccinated: While there is no vaccine for HIV, there are vaccines available for other STIs that can help to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about getting vaccinated for STIs.\nBy taking these steps, you can help to prevent the spread of HIV and protect yourself and others from this serious virus.\nHow can HIV be prevented? \u2013 HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens the body\u2019s ability to fight infections and diseases. It is spread through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. While there is no cure for HIV, it can be managed with antiretroviral therapy (ART), which helps to prevent the virus from replicating and causing damage to the immune system.\nThere are several ways to prevent the spread of HIV, including:\nUsing condoms: Condoms are a highly effective way to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

This includes avoiding high-risk behaviors, such as having multiple sexual partners or sharing needles.\nAvoiding sharing needles: Sharing needles or other injection equipment can increase the risk of HIV\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

HIV is transmitted through body fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. It can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. AIDS is the disease that develops after HIV has severely weakened a person\u2019s immune system. It is the most advanced stage of HIV infection.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV and AIDS? HIV can be present for years without causing any symptoms. However, as the virus weakens the immune system, people may experience symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. AIDS is diagnosed when a person\u2019s immune system is severely weakened and they develop opportunistic infections or cancers.\nWhat is the treatment for HIV and AIDS? There is no cure for HIV, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the virus and prevent it from progressing to AIDS. ART involves taking a combination of medications that suppress the virus and allow the immune system to recover. People with AIDS may also need treatment for opportunistic infections and cancers.\nHow can I prevent HIV and AIDS? The most effective way to prevent HIV is to avoid behaviors that can transmit the virus, such as unprotected sex and sharing needles. Using condoms and practicing safer sex can reduce the risk of transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are also available to prevent HIV transmission.\nCan I get HIV from kissing or hugging someone who has HIV? No, HIV is not transmitted through casual contact such as kissing or hugging. It is only transmitted through body fluids, as mentioned earlier.\nCan I get HIV from donating blood? No, donating blood is safe and does not transmit HIV. All donated blood is tested for HIV and other infectious diseases before it is used for transfusions.\nCan I get HIV from a mosquito bite? No, HIV is not transmitted through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes do not carry the virus and cannot transmit it from person to person.\nCan I get HIV from sharing a drinking glass or utensils with someone who has HIV? No, HIV is not transmitted through sharing drinking glasses or utensils. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact or by sharing food or drinks.\nCan I get HIV from a toilet seat? No, HIV is not transmitted through contact with toilet seats or other surfaces. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact or by touching surfaces that may have been used by someone with HIV.\nCan I get HIV from a tattoo or piercing? There is a small risk of getting HIV from a tattoo or piercing if the equipment is not properly sterilized or if the person performing the procedure has HIV. However, the risk is low if proper safety precautions are taken, such as using sterile equipment and following safe injection practices.\nCan I get HIV from a blood transfusion? The risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low in developed countries where blood is screened for infectious diseases. However, in some developing countries where blood screening is not available, there is a higher risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion.\nCan I get HIV from a needle stick injury? Yes, there is a risk of getting HIV from a needle stick injury if the needle has been used by someone with HIV. Healthcare workers and others who may be exposed to blood or body fluids should take proper precautions to prevent needle stick injuries and other exposures to HIV.\nCan I get HIV from a sexual assault? Yes, there is a risk of getting HIV from a sexual assault if the perpetrator has HIV and the victim is exposed to their body fluids. Victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention immediately and may be offered post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent HIV transmission.\nCan I get HIV from a blood test? No, HIV is not transmitted through blood tests. The needles used for blood tests are sterile and are not reused.\nCan I get HIV from a blood donation? No, donating blood does not transmit HIV. All donated blood is tested for HIV and other infectious diseases before it is used for transfusions.\nCan I get HIV from a blood transfusion in a developing country? There is a higher risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion in developing countries where blood screening is not available. However, the risk is still low if proper safety precautions are taken, such as using sterile equipment and following safe injection practices.\nCan I get HIV from a blood transfusion in a developed country? The risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion in developed countries is extremely low. All donated blood is screened for infectious diseases, including HIV, before it is used for transfusions.\nCan I get HIV from a blood test in a developing country?
