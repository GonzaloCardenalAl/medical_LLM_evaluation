The survey was sent to all 1,006 women in the SHCS. In addition, data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office were used to calculate the birth rate in the general population.\nThe survey response rate was 74.5%. The survey showed that 43.2% of women with HIV had at least one child, and 28.1% had at least one child after HIV diagnosis. The birth rate among women with HIV was 6.8 per 1,000 women compared to 10.6 per 1,000 women in the general population. The birth rate among women with HIV was lower than that of the general population in all age groups, except for the youngest age group (15-19 years).\nThe birth rate in women with HIV in Switzerland is lower than that of the general population.\n    Target answer: Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Correspondence to Dr. Nadine Lachat; nadine.lachat{at}usb.ch\nObjectives To determine whether women with HIV in Switzerland have a lower overall birth rate than women without HIV and whether the rate has changed over time.\nMethods We included all women of reproductive age (16\u201345 years) with HIV and a control group of women without HIV who were treated at Swiss HIV Cohort Study centres between 2000 and 2020. We calculated the overall birth rate (OBR) as the number of births per 1000 women-years of follow-up. We calculated OBR ratios (ORR) with 95% CIs to compare the OBR of women with HIV with that of women without HIV. We used multivariable Poisson regression to identify factors associated with the OBR.\nResults We included 10 425 women (2214 with HIV and 8211 without HIV) with 30 466 and 99 615 person-years of follow-up, respectively. The OBR was 7.2 (95% CI 6.1 to 8.4) and 21.9 (95% CI 21.5 to 22.4) for women with and without HIV, respectively, yielding an ORR of 0.33 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.39). The ORR was stable over time. The OBR was highest for women with HIV between the ages of 25 and 34 years. Women with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa had a higher OBR than women from other regions. Women with HIV who were in a relationship and who had higher CD4 cell counts had higher OBRs. Women with HIV who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) had higher OBRs than those who were not.\nConclusions The OBR among women with HIV was approximately one-third of that of women without HIV and has not increased over time. Our results suggest that the OBR of women with HIV in Switzerland could be increased by providing access to ART and support for family planning.\nData are available on reasonable request. The data are available on reasonable request from the corresponding author.\nThis is the first study to investigate the overall birth rate (OBR) of women with HIV in Switzerland.\nThe study includes a large number of women with and without HIV and a long follow\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

Yet, a lot of men who have sex with men (MSM) are not aware of their HIV status. This is why the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has launched a new campaign aimed at MSM, to encourage them to take an HIV test. The campaign is being carried out in collaboration with the Swiss AIDS Federation and is based on a concept developed by the German Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA).\nThe campaign is aimed at men who have sex with men and who are not aware of their HIV status. It is designed to raise awareness of the importance of HIV testing and to encourage MSM to take an HIV test.\nThe campaign is based on the concept of \"undetectable = uninfectious\". This means that if you are HIV-positive and take your antiretroviral medication regularly, the amount of virus in your blood will drop to such a low level that you cannot infect others. This is the case for 93% of people living with HIV in Switzerland. The campaign aims to raise awareness of this fact and to encourage MSM to take an HIV test.\nThe campaign is being carried out in collaboration with the Swiss AIDS Federation and is based on a concept developed by the German Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA). The campaign is being carried out in the form of a poster campaign, which will be displayed in public places such as train stations, bus stops and shopping centres. The posters will feature images of men who have sex with men and will include the slogan \"undetectable = uninfectious\".\nThe campaign is part of the FOPH's efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections in Switzerland. The FOPH is committed to reducing the number of new HIV infections to zero by 2030. The campaign is an important step towards achieving this goal.\nThe campaign is also part of the FOPH's efforts to reduce the stigma associated with HIV. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the fact that HIV is no longer a death sentence and that people living with HIV can lead healthy and fulfilling lives.\nThe campaign is an important step towards reducing the number of new HIV infections in Switzerland. It is also an important step towards reducing the stigma associated with HIV. The FOPH is committed to reducing the number of new HIV infections to zero by 2030 and this campaign is an important part of that effort.\n    Target answer: The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use.\n    Background Question: What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

A questionnaire was sent to these patients in order to collect information on their demographic characteristics, diabetes-related data, treatment modalities, and self-reported adherence to treatment.\nA total of 1,078 patients responded to the questionnaire (54.0% response rate). The mean age of the respondents was 66.2 years, and 50.7% were women. Of the respondents, 51.9% were treated with oral antidiabetic agents, 22.4% with insulin, and 22.2% with both. In total, 44.9% of the patients reported missing taking their treatment at least once per month. Factors associated with nonadherence were younger age, longer duration of diabetes, treatment with insulin, and a higher number of daily injections of insulin. The level of adherence was not associated with sex, BMI, or the number of daily insulin injections.\nThe level of self-reported adherence to treatment in Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes is low. Younger age, longer duration of diabetes, treatment with insulin, and a higher number of daily injections of insulin were associated with a lower level of adherence.\n    Target answer: Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
