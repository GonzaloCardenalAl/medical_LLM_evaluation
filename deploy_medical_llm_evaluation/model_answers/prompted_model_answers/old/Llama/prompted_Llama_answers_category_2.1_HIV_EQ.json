Women with HIV were identified through the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). The number of births in the general population was obtained from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.\nWe identified 1258 women with HIV who were of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the SHCS in 2010. A total of 45 women with HIV gave birth in 2010. The birth rate in women with HIV was 3.6% (95% confidence interval 2.6-4.6%) compared to 1.6% (95% confidence interval 1.6-1.7%) in the general population of women of reproductive age. The birth rate was higher in women with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa (9.0%, 95% confidence interval 6.0-12.0%) compared to Swiss women with HIV (0.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.3%). The birth rate in women from sub-Saharan Africa without HIV was 3.3% (95% confidence interval 3.2-3.4%).\nThe birth rate in women with HIV in Switzerland was more than twice as high as that in the general population. The difference was mainly driven by the high birth rate in women from sub-Saharan Africa with HIV.\n    Target answer: Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

The study population consisted of all women with HIV in Switzerland in 2020 and a sample of women without HIV in Switzerland in 2020. The main outcome measure was the birth rate.\nThe birth rate of women with HIV was 5.3 per 1000 women. The birth rate of women without HIV was 10.2 per 1000 women. The birth rate of women with HIV was 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.36\u20130.74) times the birth rate of women without HIV.\nThe birth rate of women with HIV is significantly lower than the birth rate of women without HIV. The reasons for this lower birth rate are not clear. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for the lower birth rate.\nThe Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) is a nationwide, prospective, observational cohort study with continuous enrolment of HIV-infected adults (\u2265\u200916\u00a0years) living in Switzerland [ 1 ]. The SHCS is a foundation according to art. 80 et seq. of the Swiss Civil Code and is based in Lausanne. It is organized through a network of affiliated doctors working at outpatient clinics, hospitals, and private practices throughout Switzerland.

The questionnaires are filled out by the patients and the physicians. Data collected include socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, HIV transmission category, clinical data, and details on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

This study sought to determine the prevalence of self-reported treatment adherence and the effect of patient characteristics and treatment factors on the likelihood of poor treatment adherence.\nThis study was a cross-sectional analysis of data from a representative sample of 1,150 Swiss adults with chronic disease. Participants were asked whether they had missed taking their treatment at least once per month. The effect of patient characteristics and treatment factors on the likelihood of poor treatment adherence was determined by using logistic regression.\nThe prevalence of self-reported poor treatment adherence was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.5-13.5%). The likelihood of poor treatment adherence was significantly higher for participants who were younger (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), had a lower level of education (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.93), had a lower level of self-efficacy (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), had a lower level of social support (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), and had a lower level of treatment satisfaction (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Treatment factors did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of poor treatment adherence.\nThe prevalence of self-reported poor treatment adherence in Switzerland is high and is significantly associated with patient characteristics. Treatment factors do not have a significant effect on the likelihood of poor treatment adherence.\n    Target answer: Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: What are the implications for testing and treatment?\nThe average time to a CD4 count of 200 was 7.2 years for those who were tested after the age of 20 and 6.5 years for those tested before the age of 20. This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.6). The average time to a CD4 count of 200 was 5.5 years for those who were tested before the age of 20 and had an initial CD4 count of 300-350, and 6.5 years for those who were tested after the age of 20 and had an initial CD4 count of 300-350. This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.7).\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the time to a CD4 count of 200 between those who were tested before or after the age of 20. This suggests that the age at which a person is tested for HIV does not have a significant impact on the time it takes for their CD4 count to drop below 200. However, the average time to a CD4 count of 200 was shorter for those who were tested before the age of 20 and had an initial CD4 count of 300-350. This suggests that individuals who are tested for HIV at a younger age and have a lower initial CD4 count may be at a higher risk of developing AIDS.\nThe study included 1,000 individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300. The participants were divided into two groups based on the age at which they were tested: those who were tested before the age of 20 and those who were tested after the age of 20. The time to a CD4 count of 200 was calculated for each participant and compared between the two groups using a t-test.\nThe results of the study suggest that the age at which a person is tested for HIV does not have a significant impact on the time it takes for their CD4 count to drop below 200. However, individuals who are tested for HIV at a younger age and have a lower initial CD4 count may be at a higher risk of developing AIDS. This highlights the importance of early testing and treatment for HIV, as well as the need for ongoing monitoring of CD4 counts in individuals who are living with HIV.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
