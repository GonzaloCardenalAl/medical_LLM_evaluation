They can be done using blood or oral fluid.\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These look for both HIV antibodies and antigens (part of the virus itself). They can detect HIV earlier than antibody-only tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look for the virus's genetic material (RNA). They are the most expensive and usually reserved for specific situations, like confirming positive results or diagnosing acute infection.\n\nInitial screening often uses an antibody or antigen/antibody test. If positive, confirmatory tests (like a different type of antibody test or a NAT) are performed.\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

It's typically described in three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. The virus is multiplying rapidly, and the immune system is starting to respond. Many people experience flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers). Viral load is very high during this stage, making transmission risk high.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** This stage can last for many years (a decade or more without treatment). The virus is still active but reproduces at low levels. People may not have any symptoms, or only mild ones. However, the virus is still damaging the immune system. With treatment (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades and may never progress to AIDS.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when the immune system is badly damaged, usually indicated by a very low CD4 cell count (less than 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the development of certain opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\n\nIt's important to remember that with early diagnosis and consistent antiretroviral therapy (ART), most people with HIV can live long, healthy lives and never reach the AIDS stage.\n    Target answer: The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

People living with HIV are at increased risk for several comorbidities, both related to the virus itself and its effects on the immune system, as well as non-HIV related conditions often associated with aging and lifestyle factors.\n\nCommon comorbidities include:\n\n*   **Cardiovascular disease:** Heart attack, stroke, peripheral vascular disease.\n*   **Kidney disease:** HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), chronic kidney disease.\n*   **Liver disease:** Hepatitis B or C co-infection, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis.\n*   **Certain cancers:** Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, anal cancer.\n*   **Bone disease:** Osteoporosis, osteopenia.\n*   **Neurological conditions:** Neurocognitive disorders (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or HAND).\n*   **Mental health conditions:** Depression, anxiety, substance use disorders.\n*   **Infectious diseases:** Tuberculosis, pneumonia, opportunistic infections (especially if HIV is not well-controlled).\n\nIt's important to remember that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people with HIV can live long, healthy lives, and the risk of some of these comorbidities can be significantly reduced. Regular screening and management of these conditions are crucial.\n    Target answer: The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals.\n    Background Question: What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

HIV prevention involves several strategies:\n\n1.  **Condom Use:** Consistent and correct use of latex or polyurethane condoms significantly reduces the risk of transmission during sexual activity.\n2.  **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Taking a daily medication (like Truvada or Descovy) can prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at high risk.\n3.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Taking antiretroviral medications soon after a potential exposure (within 72 hours) can prevent HIV infection.\n4.  **Testing and Treatment:** Regular HIV testing allows for early diagnosis. Treating HIV effectively with antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the viral load, often to undetectable levels, making transmission extremely unlikely (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).\n5.  **Harm Reduction for Injection Drug Users:** Using sterile needles and syringes and not sharing injection equipment prevents HIV transmission. Needle exchange programs can help.\n6.  **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):** HIV-positive pregnant individuals taking ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their baby.\n\nThese are the main, evidence-based methods. Do you have any specific questions about one of these?\n    Target answer: HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

This significantly reduces the viral load, making transmission much less likely.\n2.  **Infant Prophylaxis:** The newborn receives antiretroviral medication for several weeks after birth.\n3.  **Delivery Method:** Cesarean section (C-section) may be recommended if the mother's viral load is high near delivery, though ART is the primary factor. Vaginal delivery is generally safe if the viral load is undetectable.\n4.  **Feeding:** Avoid breastfeeding in settings where safe alternatives are available. Formula feeding eliminates the risk of transmission through breast milk.\n\nThese interventions, when implemented together, reduce the risk of transmission to less than 1%.\n    Target answer: To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

It's not actively replicating.\n*   **Active Infection:** The virus is replicating, producing new virions, and causing damage to the immune system.\n\n**The \"Switch\" Process:**\n\n1.  **Activation Signal:** Something triggers the resting CD4+ T cell where latent HIV resides. This could be:\n    *   Immune activation (e.g., response to another infection, inflammation).\n    *   Cytokines (signaling molecules released by immune cells).\n    *   Certain drugs (though this is less common clinically, it's relevant in research).\n2.  **Viral Reactivation:** The activation signal tells the cell to \"wake up.\" This includes turning on the HIV genes that were previously silenced.\n3.  **Viral Replication:** The activated cell starts producing HIV RNA and proteins.\n4.  **Virion Production & Spread:** New virus particles (virions) are assembled and released from the cell, ready to infect other CD4+ T cells.\n5.  **Immune Response & Cell Death:** The newly active infection triggers an immune response. Often, the infected cell is eventually killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\n**In essence:** It's a process of cellular activation leading to viral gene expression, replication, and ultimately, the production of new infectious virus. This reactivation is a major barrier to curing HIV, as these latent reservoirs can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n    Target answer: The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
