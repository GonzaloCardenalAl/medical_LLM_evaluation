If the patients have a 5% CVD risk according to SCORE2, and they are not on statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, it is recommended to start statin therapy. This is because HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and statins have been shown to reduce this risk. However, the decision to start statin therapy should be individualized and discussed with each patient, taking into account their overall health status and potential side effects.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.

HIV can be transmitted through various routes, including heterosexual sex, sharing needles or other equipment for injecting drugs, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. It is essential to avoid making assumptions based on a patient's HIV status and provide appropriate care and support regardless of their sexual orientation.\n    Target answer: No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population.\n    Background Question: In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty.

The erythema migrans rash, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and fever are all common symptoms of Lyme disease. The patient's recent hiking trip in an endemic area and lack of tick bite prevention measures also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. However, given the patient's recent unprotected sexual activity, it is also important to consider the possibility of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV or syphilis, and to test for these infections as well.\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement.

She is HLA-B*57:01 positive, which means she can tolerate ABC without risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, her CVD risk is >10%, and DTG is a good option for patients with high CVD risk as it has a neutral effect on lipid profiles. This regimen is also well-tolerated and has a high efficacy rate.\n    Target answer: No, the ABC/3TC + DTG treatment regimen can not be used in people with high cardiovascular risk and HLA-B*57:01 positive.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy. She is HLA-B*57:01 positive and CVD risk >10%.

The current standard of care for HIV treatment is to use a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs from different classes to suppress the virus. Dual therapy is not recommended as it may lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure. The patient should continue with their current regimen and should be closely monitored to ensure viral suppression.\n    Target answer: XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy.\n    Background Question: A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation.

However, TAF/FTC/BIC is not metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes, so it is unlikely that phenytoin will cause any significant drug-drug interactions with this regimen. Nonetheless, it is always important to monitor the patient's viral load and adjust the ART regimen if necessary.\n    Target answer: Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up.
