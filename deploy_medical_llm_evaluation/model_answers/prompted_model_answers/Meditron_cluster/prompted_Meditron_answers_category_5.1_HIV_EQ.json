PML is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV disease and low CD4 counts. The patient's history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications likely contributed to her immunocompromised state and increased risk for PML.\n    Target answer: John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

Other potential side effects of this medication include nephrolithiasis, hyperbilirubinemia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. It is important to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and amylase levels, and to advise him to report any symptoms of pancreatitis such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain, spinal cord, or eyes, and is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The ring-enhancing lesion on MRI and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid are also consistent with this diagnosis. Glioblastoma is a type of brain tumor that is less common in HIV-positive individuals and is not typically associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma.

The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, along with the presence of crackles over the right lower lung base, suggest a bacterial pneumonia. The patient's HIV status and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 520/mm\u00b3 are not significantly low, making opportunistic infections less likely. The recent patient with similar symptoms caused by Staphylococcus aureus does not necessarily indicate that this patient has the same organism. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, especially in smokers.\n    Target answer: The most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

This condition is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV disease and low CD4 counts, and it typically presents with painless, friable skin lesions and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss. The skin biopsy showing vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils is also consistent with bacillary angiomatosis.

The patient's history of HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and homelessness are all risk factors for TB. The symptoms of fever, productive cough, chest pain, and pleural effusion, along with the x-ray findings of pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy, are also consistent with TB. The pleural fluid analysis showing lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, and high adenosine deaminase further supports the diagnosis of TB. While lung cancer is a possibility, the patient's presentation and pleural fluid analysis are more consistent with TB.\n    Target answer: Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest.

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

However, the patient's cachexia and acute distress suggest that he may be septic or have another systemic infection, and therefore, additional diagnostic testing such as blood cultures, chest x-ray, and urine analysis may also be necessary. The patient should be started on empiric antibiotics and antifungals, and any other necessary supportive care should be provided.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate next step in management is a neurological exam with fundoscopy.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion. He is a cachectic man in acute distress, unable to respond to questions or follow commands. His friend confides that the patient has been sexually active with multiple male partners and was diagnosed with HIV several months ago, but was lost to follow up. Based on prior records, his most recent CD4 count was 65 cells/uL. Most frequently, doctors do a lumbar puncture as the next step in the management plan.

MPGN is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by the proliferation of mesangial cells and the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The patient's HIV infection, nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia are consistent with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), which can cause MPGN. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of edema, weight gain, and decreased sensation around the mouth and fingers suggest that he may also have a peripheral neuropathy, which is a common complication of HIVAN.\n    Target answer: Segmental sclerosis is the most likely finding.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally.

The presence of fever, cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and crackles on physical examination are consistent with pneumonia. The chest x-ray showing a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use, as well as his homeless status and lack of medication adherence, increase his risk for developing pneumonia. The CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 280/mm3 indicates that he has moderate immunosuppression, which also increases his risk for opportunistic infections. Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is a condition in which a pouch forms in the esophagus, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or the findings on his chest x-ray.\n    Target answer: Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500).

The next best step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, including culture and PCR for common pathogens. Additionally, the patient should be started on empiric treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, which typically includes amphotericin B and flucytosine, rather than itraconazole.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72.

The symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a paradoxical worsening of the tuberculosis infection due to an immune response. The patient should be continued on the current antitubercular regimen and antiretroviral therapy. The addition of corticosteroids may be considered to control the inflammation.\n    Target answer: Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

HIVAN is a common cause of kidney disease in patients with HIV, especially in African-Americans. It is characterized by proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency, and is often associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a different type of kidney disease that can also cause proteinuria, but it is not as strongly associated with HIV infection.\n    Target answer: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction.

The Antistreptolysin O titer is not a reliable test for syphilis as it is used to diagnose rheumatic fever. The most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis is a specific treponemal test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test or the treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA). These tests detect antibodies against the bacterium that causes syphilis and are highly specific and sensitive. A positive result on one of these tests would confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.\n    Target answer: A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

The high levels of uric acid and potassium, along with the elevated creatinine and BUN, are indicative of TLS. \n\nThe most appropriate therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities would be hydration with intravenous fluids, along with the administration of Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that rapidly breaks down uric acid into allantoin, which is more soluble and easily excreted by the kidneys. Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase and reduces uric acid production, is not as effective in the acute setting of TLS and may even worsen the condition by causing xanthine nephropathy. Therefore, Rasburicase is the preferred treatment for TLS in this patient.\n    Target answer: Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities.\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia.
