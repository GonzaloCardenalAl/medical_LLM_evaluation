The SCORE2 risk estimate is based on traditional risk factors and does not take into account the increased risk of CVD associated with HIV infection. Studies have shown that HIV-positive individuals have a higher risk of CVD compared to HIV-negative individuals, and statin therapy has been shown to reduce this risk. Therefore, it is recommended to initiate statin therapy in both patients, regardless of their SCORE2 risk estimate.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive.

The erythema migrans rash, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, and palpitations and dizziness are all common symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome, which can occur within 2-4 weeks after HIV exposure. The patient should be tested for HIV and started on antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible if the test is positive.\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

The patient's viral load is high, indicating that the current regimen is not effective in suppressing the virus. Dual therapy with XTC and TDF may not be sufficient to achieve viral suppression and may lead to drug resistance. A more potent regimen with at least three drugs should be considered, and the patient should be monitored closely for viral load and CD4 count.\n    Target answer: XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy.\n    Background Question: A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation.

This could potentially lead to lower levels of BIC in the blood, reducing its effectiveness against HIV. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the patient's viral load closely and consider adjusting the ART regimen if necessary.\n    Target answer: Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug.
