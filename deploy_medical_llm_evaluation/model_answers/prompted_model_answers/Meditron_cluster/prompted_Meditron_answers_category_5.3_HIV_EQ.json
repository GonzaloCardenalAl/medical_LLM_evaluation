The patient's low CD4 count and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Unlike HAND, PML is a more severe and rapidly progressive condition that requires prompt treatment, usually with antiretroviral therapy and supportive care.\n    Target answer: John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV infection. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid is highly suggestive of PCNSL. Glioblastoma is a type of brain tumor, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history and laboratory findings.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

The patient's history of HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and homelessness puts him at increased risk for TB. The presence of a left-sided pleural effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, high LDH, and high adenosine deaminase in the pleural fluid is consistent with TB pleuritis. The hilar lymphadenopathy on the chest x-ray also supports the diagnosis of TB. Lung cancer is less likely in this patient given his age and the findings on the pleural fluid analysis.\n    Target answer: Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. Analysis of the pleural fluid shows an effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, an LDH of 500 U/L, and high adenosine deaminase.

However, given the patient's altered mental status and potential for increased intracranial pressure, a lumbar puncture should not be performed without first ruling out any contraindications with a head CT scan. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a head CT scan to rule out any contraindications to lumbar puncture.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate next step in management is a neurological exam with fundoscopy.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion. He is a cachectic man in acute distress, unable to respond to questions or follow commands. His friend confides that the patient has been sexually active with multiple male partners and was diagnosed with HIV several months ago, but was lost to follow up.

The patient's cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base are all consistent with pneumonia. The hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field on chest x-ray also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use further increases his risk for pneumonia. The diagnosis of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is unlikely as it would not explain the patient's fever, night sweats, and infiltrate on chest x-ray.\n    Target answer: Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500).

Given the patient's history of inconsistent adherence to his HIV medications, he may be at increased risk for opportunistic infections. The next best step in management would be to obtain a CT scan of the head to evaluate for any lesions or mass effect that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, a lumbar puncture should be performed to evaluate for signs of meningitis, such as elevated white blood cells and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Empiric treatment with itraconazole may not be appropriate at this time, as it is typically used for the treatment of fungal infections such as histoplasmosis or blastomycosis, and may not be effective for the suspected CNS infections in this patient.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

The skin biopsy showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain confirms this diagnosis. The appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is doxycycline, which is effective against both B. henselae and B. quintana. The patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count indicates advanced HIV disease, and she should also be started on antiretroviral therapy.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

The patient should also be started on corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation associated with IRIS.\n    Target answer: Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

The most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma is a biopsy of the affected tissue, which in this case would be a mediastinal lymph node biopsy. A biopsy would provide histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis and allow for further subtyping of the lymphoma. Antistreptolysin O titer is not a relevant test for diagnosing lymphoma.\n    Target answer: A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.
