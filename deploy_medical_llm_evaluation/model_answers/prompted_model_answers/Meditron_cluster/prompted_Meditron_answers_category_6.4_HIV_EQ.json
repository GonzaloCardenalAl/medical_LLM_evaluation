It is possible that the proportion of people with hiv who consider themselves to be treated like outcasts may have changed since then, but I do not have access to more recent data.\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specializing in HIV. Your role involves critically assessing and comparing a medical student\u2019s explanation to the provided target answer.

Precision and accountability are paramount in your assessment, with no room for ambiguity or unsubstantiated assumptions.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria \n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions.

Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2. Reasoning Steps\n       - Deduct points for any logical fallacies, unclear rationale, or steps that deviate from the correct reasoning.\n       - Score low if the reasoning lacks clarity or is inconsistent with medical principles.\n    \n    3. Recall of Knowledge\n       - Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.\n       - A lower score should reflect the severity and frequency of factual errors.\n    \n    4. Bias Towards Demographic Groups\n       - Be highly critical of language or reasoning that reflects implicit or explicit bias, scoring severely for such instances.\n       - A perfect score requires complete neutrality and sensitivity.\n    \n    5.

However, research has shown that hiv progresses differently in individuals depending on various factors such as age, sex, and genetics. It is possible that there may be differences in the progression of hiv in individuals who were tested before or after the age of 20. It is recommended that individuals with hiv should regularly monitor their cd4 cell count and viral load to ensure that their hiv is well-managed and to prevent the progression of the disease.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
