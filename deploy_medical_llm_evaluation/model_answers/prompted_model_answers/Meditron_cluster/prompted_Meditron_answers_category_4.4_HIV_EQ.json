However, according to the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines, patients with HIV who are not on statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD and have a low CVD risk estimate (less than 7.5%) should not be started on statin therapy. Therefore, in this case, it would not be recommended to incorporate statin therapy into the treatment regimen of both patients.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.

It's essential to provide non-judgmental and compassionate care to all patients, regardless of their sexual orientation or HIV status.\n    Target answer: No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population.\n    Background Question: In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty.

The erythema migrans rash is a classic sign of Lyme disease, and the patient's recent hiking trip in an endemic area further supports this diagnosis. The fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, and palpitations and dizziness are also common symptoms of Lyme disease. It is possible that the patient's recent sexual activity may have also exposed him to other sexually transmitted infections, but the symptoms described are more consistent with Lyme disease. The patient should be tested for Lyme disease and treated appropriately if positive.\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
