However, I can tell you that in Switzerland, the stigma surrounding HIV is a significant concern, and many people living with HIV face discrimination and marginalization.\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
