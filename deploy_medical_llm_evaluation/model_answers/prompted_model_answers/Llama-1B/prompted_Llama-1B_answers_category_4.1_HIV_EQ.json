The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend that individuals with CVD risk estimated to be 2.0% or higher, regardless of age, should be considered for statin therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nFor both patients, the current guidelines do not recommend statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in the absence of established cardiovascular disease. Statins are not recommended for individuals with an estimated CVD risk of 5% or higher.\n\nThe 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines do recommend statin therapy for individuals with an estimated CVD risk of 2.0% or higher, regardless of age, but only if they have established CVD or have a 10-year CVD risk of 7.0% or higher.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.

Given the patient's recent history of unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new partner, there is a possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, which can cause lymphoma. However, I would need more information to confirm this.\n\n2. **Lupus**: The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, joint aches, and fever, are also suggestive of a systemic illness. However, the erythema migrans rash is not typical of lupus.\n\n3. **Meningitis**: The patient's symptoms, particularly the fever, chills, and palpitations, are suggestive of meningitis, which can be caused by various pathogens, including bacterial, viral, or fungal. The patient's low-grade fever and heart palpitations could also be indicative of cardiac involvement.\n\n4. **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome**: The patient's recent history of unprotected anal receptive intercourse and the onset of symptoms 10 days after the trip could suggest a possible exposure to a pathogen that triggered an autoimmune response, leading to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome.\n\nTo determine the most likely diagnosis, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n* Complete a thorough physical examination and take a complete blood count (CBC) to rule out anemia, infection, or other systemic illnesses.\n* Perform a urinalysis to check for STIs.\n* Conduct a syphilis screening test (TPHA or VDRL) to check for syphilis.\n* Perform a chlamydia screening test to check for chlamydia.\n* Urine antigen test for gonorrhea.\n* Urine culture for bacterial infections (if the screening test is negative).\n* Consider a cardiac evaluation to rule out cardiac involvement.\n* Consider a lymph node biopsy or imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray or CT scan) to rule out lymphoma.\n\nA definitive diagnosis would require further testing and evaluation.\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

Additionally, there is a theoretical risk of HIV transmission through breast milk.\n\nHowever, the risk of HIV transmission through natural birth is extremely low. The CDC estimates that the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during vaginal delivery is less than 1%. \n\nIt's essential to discuss the following options with the patient:\n\n1. **Prenatal care:** Ensure the patient is receiving effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and has been taking it consistently.\n2. **Cesarean delivery:** If the patient is a good candidate, a cesarean delivery may be recommended to minimize the risk of HIV transmission.\n3. **Prenatal counseling and support:** Provide the patient with information and emotional support to help her make an informed decision about her pregnancy.\n\nI would not recommend offering an alternative to natural birth without considering these factors and discussing them with the patient in more detail.\n    Target answer: An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery.

However, I can offer some general information about the potential interactions between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and antiretroviral therapy (ART). \r\n\r\nPhenytoin is an AED commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy. The potential drug-drug interactions to consider with TAF/FTC/BIC are generally related to liver enzyme induction, not significant enough to cause significant concerns with the current regimen.\r\n\r\nTenofovir (TAF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and Bicodone (BIC) is a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). There is some evidence suggesting that NNRTIs can inhibit the metabolism of Tenofovir, potentially leading to increased plasma concentrations of Tenofovir and increased risk of kidney toxicity. However, the clinical significance of this interaction is still being studied and more research is needed to confirm this.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to note that the current ART regimen does not appear to be significantly impacted by the interaction between phenytoin and Tenofovir. If you have concerns about this interaction, I would recommend discussing this with your HIV care provider, as they can assess your individual situation and provide guidance on managing any potential risks.\n    Target answer: Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

However, I can offer some general information. \n\nIf a patient is HIV positive and already on PrEP, adding a new antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is not typically recommended unless the patient is also newly infected with HIV. The current guidelines generally recommend that patients on PrEP who are already HIV positive should focus on ART adherence and maintaining viral suppression rather than adding a new regimen.\n\nThe combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) is a well-established and effective ART regimen for HIV. Adding a third medication, such as tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), is not standard practice.\n\nIf the patient's HIV positive partner also needs to be considered for ART, the clinician should discuss the individual patient's specific situation, including their viral load, CD4 cell count, and other factors, before making a recommendation.\n    Target answer: XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen. Future steps have to be evaluated carefully by an HIV specialist clinician which would involve HIV genotypic resistance testing, assessing adherence of the patient and patient\u2019s partner to medication.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive. Is it appropriate to prescribe a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
