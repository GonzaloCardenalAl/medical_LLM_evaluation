Understanding the prevalence of stigma can help inform strategies to address it.\n\n### Answer:\nUnfortunately, the provided data does not specify the proportion of PWH in Switzerland who consider themselves to be treated like outcasts.\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

However, it is generally known that cd4 cell count decline can vary depending on multiple factors such as viral load, adherence to treatment, co-infections, and genetic predisposition. Therefore, it is difficult to make a general statement about the difference between pwh tested before or after the age of 20 in terms of the time taken for the cd4 cell count to drop below 200. It would be best to consult with a healthcare professional or a research study for more specific and accurate information.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
