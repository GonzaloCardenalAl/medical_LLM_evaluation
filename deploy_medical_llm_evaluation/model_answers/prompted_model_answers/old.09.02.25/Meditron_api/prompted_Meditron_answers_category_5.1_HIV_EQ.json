Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Incorrect Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-20: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 21-40: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 41-60: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but with minor errors in interpretation.\n       - 61-80: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with minor lapses in comprehension.\n       - 81-100: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: As a general guideline, the decision to start statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD is based on the patient's CVD risk estimate. In this case, both patients have a 5% risk, which is considered low to moderate risk. It is recommended to consider statin therapy for patients with a 10-year CVD risk of \u226510%, so neither patient meets this criterion.\n\nHowever, HIV-infected patients are at higher risk of CVD compared to the general population, and HIV infection itself is considered a risk factor for CVD. Therefore, it is recommended to assess these patients' CVD risk more aggressively, and some guidelines suggest starting statin therapy in HIV-infected patients with a CVD risk \u22657.5%.\n\nGiven this information, it is recommended to assess the patients' CVD risk more closely, including their HIV-related factors, such as viral load, CD4 count, and ART regimen. If the patients have additional risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, or family history of CVD, starting statin therapy may be considered. It is recommended to consult with a cardiologist or an infectious disease specialist to determine the best course of action.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement.
