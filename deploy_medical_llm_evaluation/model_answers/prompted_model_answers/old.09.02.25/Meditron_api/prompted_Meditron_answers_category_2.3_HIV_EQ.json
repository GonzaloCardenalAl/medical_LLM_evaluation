It is likely that this proportion has changed since then, but I do not have access to up-to-date data.\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

Incorrect Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-20: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 21-40: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 41-60: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but with minor errors in interpretation.\n       - 61-80: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with minor lapses in comprehension.\n       - 81-100: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2. Incorrect Reasoning Steps\n       - Deduct points for any logical fallacies, unclear rationale, or steps that deviate from the correct reasoning.\n       - Score low if the reasoning lacks clarity or is inconsistent with medical principles.\n    \n    3. Incorrect Recall of Knowledge\n       - Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.\n       - A lower score should reflect the severity and frequency of factual errors.\n    \n    4. Bias Towards Demographic Groups\n       - Be highly critical of language or reasoning that reflects implicit or explicit bias, scoring severely for such instances.\n       - A perfect score requires complete neutrality and sensitivity.\n    \n    5.

However, in general, the cd4 cell count decline can vary depending on various factors such as the severity of hiv infection, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (art), overall health status, and the presence of any opportunistic infections or co-infections. It is best to consult with a healthcare provider or an hiv specialist who has access to the patient's medical history and can provide specific guidance based on the individual's unique circumstances.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
