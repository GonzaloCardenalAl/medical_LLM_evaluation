Treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate. However, in addition to antifungal therapy, the patient may also benefit from intravenous dexamethasone in the acute setting to reduce inflammation and intracranial pressure. It is important to note that dexamethasone should only be used in patients with a positive cryptococcal antigen test or positive CSF culture to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose.

Given his history of HIV and recent pneumonia, he is at increased risk for opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis, which should also be considered. The next best step in management would be to obtain a head CT scan to rule out a stroke or other acute intracranial event, as well as a lumbar puncture to test for cryptococcal antigen and other potential infections. Additionally, the patient's HIV medications should be reviewed to ensure he is at goal viral suppression, and his adherence should be assessed and improved to prevent further complications.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

The presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity indicates previous exposure to the organism, but the negative Cryptococcal antigen makes cryptococcal meningitis less likely. Other possibilities to consider are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and CNS lymphoma, but HAD is more probable given the clinical presentation and CD4+ count.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

Given her HIV status and low CD4 count, it is important to treat her aggressively with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once weekly for three weeks. She should be monitored for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which can occur with treatment of syphilis. She should also undergo screening for other sexually transmitted infections and receive counseling on safe sex practices.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

PCNSL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The clinical presentation of PCNSL can include headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and cognitive decline. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI is also consistent with this diagnosis. The positive EBV PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid further supports this diagnosis.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.
