A thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, laboratory values, and risk factors should be performed. The use of statins in HIV-positive patients also needs careful consideration due to potential drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy. A consultation with a cardiologist or an infectious disease specialist may be helpful in determining the best approach for these patients.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive.

HIV can be transmitted through various means, including heterosexual sex, injection drug use, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. It is not appropriate to assume a patient's sexual orientation based on their HIV status. It is important to provide all patients with comprehensive and inclusive HIV care, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n    Target answer: No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population.\n    Background Question: In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty.

The erythema migrans rash, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, and possible cardiac involvement are all consistent with this condition. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. It is common in endemic areas, particularly in areas with high grass and wooded areas where ticks are prevalent. The patient's recent hiking trip in an endemic area is a risk factor for Lyme disease. The patient's recent unprotected sexual activity may also suggest the possibility of an STI, such as HIV, but the symptoms presented are more consistent with Lyme disease. It is important to rule out other potential diagnoses, including STIs, through appropriate testing.\n    Target answer: These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

This regimen is also potent, well-tolerated, and has a low risk of resistance development.\n    Target answer: No, the ABC/3TC + DTG treatment regimen can not be used in people with high cardiovascular risk and HLA-B*57:01 positive.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy.

This is because the patient's viral load is high, and dual therapy may not be effective in suppressing the virus. The patient needs a more potent regimen with at least three drugs, including two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a third drug from a different class, such as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI). The patient's current regimen should be reviewed, and a new regimen should be chosen based on genotype resistance testing if resistance mutations are present.\n    Target answer: XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy.\n    Background Question: A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation.

However, the patient's increased viral load may be due to potential drug-drug interactions between phenytoin and the ART regimen. Phenytoin is a known inducer of CYP3A4, which can increase the metabolism of Bictegravir (BIC), potentially decreasing its effectiveness. A consultation with the patient's neurologist and a review of her antiepileptic drug regimen may be necessary to assess potential changes.\n    Target answer: Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up.
