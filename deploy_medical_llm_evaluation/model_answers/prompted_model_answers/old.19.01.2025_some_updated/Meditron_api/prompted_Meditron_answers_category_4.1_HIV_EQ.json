This means that a negative test result has a 96% probability of correctly ruling out AIDS in the study population.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination.

The symptoms of progressive cognitive dysfunction, motor disorders, and behavioral changes in a patient with advanced HIV disease are characteristic of this condition. The history of noncompliance with HIV medications and a very low CD4+ count (< 200/\u03bcL) further support this diagnosis. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are also consistent with HIV-associated dementia.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

The use of these medications, particularly indinavir, poses a risk for several adverse effects.\n\n#### Adverse Effects of Indinavir\n\nIndinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It works by inhibiting the protease enzyme, which is essential for the replication of the virus. However, indinavir is also associated with several adverse effects.\n\n### Adverse Effect: Nephrolithiasis\n\n1. **Mechanism of Action:**\n - Indinavir is excreted in the urine and can crystallize in the kidneys, leading to the formation of stones.\n2. **Risk Factors:**\n - Dehydration and low urine output increase the risk of nephrolithiasis.\n - Patients with a history of kidney stones or those who are not adequately hydrated are at a higher risk.\n3. **Symptoms:**\n - Symptoms of nephrolithiasis include severe flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria (blood in the urine).\n4. **Prevention:**\n - Adequate hydration is essential to prevent nephrolithiasis in patients taking indinavir.\n - Patients should drink plenty of water to help flush out the kidneys and reduce the risk of stone formation.\n\n### Adverse Effect: Hyperglycemia\n\n1. **Mechanism of Action:**\n - Protease inhibitors, including indinavir, can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.\n - This can lead to the development of diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders.\n2. **Risk Factors:**\n - Patients with a family history of diabetes or those who are overweight or obese are at a higher risk.\n3. **Symptoms:**\n - Symptoms of hyperglycemia include increased thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss.\n4. **Prevention:**\n - Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hyperglycemia in patients taking indinavir.\n - Patients should be advised to maintain a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity to reduce the risk of developing diabetes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe patient in this scenario is at greatest risk for nephrolithiasis and hyperglycemia due to the use of indinavir. It is essential to monitor the patient's kidney function and blood glucose levels regularly to prevent these adverse effects. Adequate hydration and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels can help prevent these complications.\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

This increases the risk of transmission to the newborn.\n*   **Labor and Delivery:** Labor was uncomplicated, and the baby's Apgar scores are normal, indicating no immediate complications.\n*   **Physical Examination:** The newborn shows no abnormalities, which is a positive sign.\n\n#### Next Steps in Management:\n\n*   **Providing Antiretroviral Therapy:** The newborn should be started on antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n*   **Recommended Medications:**\n    *   **Zidovudine:** This is the first-line medication for newborns born to HIV-positive mothers. It has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n    *   **Nevirapine:** This medication is also effective in reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, it is typically used in combination with zidovudine.\n\n#### Recommended Approach:\nThe recommended approach for this newborn is to start zidovudine immediately and continue it for 6 weeks. This will help reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to start zidovudine immediately and continue it for 6 weeks.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your evaluation should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n    \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n    \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score\"\n    }\n    "
