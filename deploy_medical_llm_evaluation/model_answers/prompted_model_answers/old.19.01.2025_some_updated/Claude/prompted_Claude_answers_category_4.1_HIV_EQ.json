Opening pressure >250 mm H2O indicates elevated ICP\n2. High ICP in cryptococcal meningitis is associated with increased mortality and poor neurologic outcomes\n3. Guidelines recommend:\n   - If opening pressure \u2265250 mm H2O, remove CSF to reduce pressure by 50% or to normal pressure (\u2264200 mm H2O)\n   - Daily lumbar punctures may be needed until pressure normalizes\n   - Some patients may require temporary lumbar drains or VP shunts if pressures remain elevated\n\nThe goal is to reduce ICP to improve symptoms and prevent complications like vision loss or death. Therapeutic lumbar punctures should continue until the opening pressure has been normal for several days and symptoms have improved.\n    Target answer: In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure.\n    Background Question: A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine.

The patient presents with acute onset of focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness), which could represent a stroke. Given his multiple risk factors (HIV, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history), this needs to be evaluated immediately.\n\n2. The presence of fever and his immunocompromised status (CD4 count <200) also raises concern for CNS infection or abscess, which can present with focal neurological symptoms.\n\n3. A non-contrast head CT is the initial imaging study of choice because:\n   - It can quickly rule out hemorrhagic stroke\n   - It can identify large ischemic strokes\n   - It can show mass lesions or abscesses that might be present in an immunocompromised patient\n   - It's faster and more readily available than MRI\n   - It needs to be done before any consideration of thrombolytic therapy\n\nAfter the CT:\n- If negative for hemorrhage and showing signs of ischemic stroke within the appropriate time window, consider thrombolysis\n- If showing mass lesions or signs of infection, further workup may include:\n  - MRI with contrast\n  - Lumbar puncture (if no contraindications)\n  - Blood cultures\n  - Additional testing for opportunistic infections\n\nThe patient will also need optimization of his HIV treatment given his poor adherence and low CD4 count.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

(potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: The most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n\n1. Patient Profile:\n- HIV-positive with poor compliance\n- Very low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) indicating severe immunosuppression\n- High viral load (>100,000 copies/mL)\n\n2. Clinical Presentation:\n- Progressive neurological symptoms (weakness, unsteady gait)\n- Cognitive decline (forgetfulness, difficulty with familiar tasks)\n- Behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation)\n- Right leg weakness\n- Confusion and disorientation\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- MRI showing disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions\n- No mass effect (typical for PML)\n\n4. Time Course:\n- Symptoms developing over weeks to months, which is consistent with PML\n\nPML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS and CD4+ counts below 200/\u03bcL. The absence of enhancement on MRI and lack of mass effect helps distinguish it from other HIV-associated conditions like toxoplasmosis (which typically shows ring-enhancing lesions with mass effect) or primary CNS lymphoma.\n\nWhile the patient is Toxoplasma IgG positive, the MRI findings are not consistent with toxoplasmosis. The negative cryptococcal antigen also helps rule out cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Initiating antiretroviral therapy\n2. Supportive care\n3. Managing other comorbidities\n\nThe prognosis is generally poor, but survival may improve with effective antiretroviral therapy.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

(incorrect rationale for answering the question)\n    Question 3\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of incorrect recall of knowledge? (mention of an irrelevant and/or incorrect fact for answering the question)\n    Question 4\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any evidence of bias towards any demographic groups? (potential medical or healthcare bias towards different social groups)\n    Question 5\n    Does the medical student\u2019s answer contain any greater severity/extent of possible harm? (potential harm towards the patient\u2019s safety)\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: For this patient who is starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the most significant adverse effects to monitor for are:\n\nFor Zidovudine (AZT):\n1. Bone marrow suppression leading to:\n- Anemia\n- Neutropenia\n2. Myopathy\n3. Lactic acidosis\n\nFor Indinavir:\n1. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)\n2. Hyperbilirubinemia\n3. Hyperglycemia\n4. Lipodystrophy\n\nFor Lamivudine (3TC):\nGenerally well-tolerated with fewer side effects, but can cause:\n1. Headache\n2. Fatigue\n3. Nausea\n\nAmong these, the most concerning and significant adverse effects to monitor would be:\n1. Zidovudine-induced bone marrow suppression\n2. Indinavir-associated kidney stones\n\nKey preventive measures:\n- Regular monitoring of blood counts\n- Ensuring adequate hydration (especially with indinavir)\n- Monitoring for signs of anemia or neutropenia\n- Regular blood sugar monitoring\n- Monitoring liver function\n    Target answer: The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

Patient Profile:\n- HIV-positive patient\n- Low CD4+ count (90/\u03bcL), indicating severe immunosuppression\n- History of poor medication compliance\n\n2. Clinical Presentation:\n- Neurological symptoms: headaches, vertigo\n- Personality changes\n- Ataxia\n- Cognitive impairment (low MMSE score)\n\n3. Imaging Findings:\n- Solitary ring-enhancing lesion\n- Large size (4.5 cm)\n- Location in corpus callosum\n\n4. CSF Analysis:\n- Positive EBV DNA PCR\n- Slight pleocytosis\n\nPrimary CNS lymphoma in HIV patients is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The presence of EBV DNA in the CSF is highly sensitive and specific for PCNSL in this setting. The typical radiographic appearance includes a large solitary enhancing lesion, often crossing the corpus callosum.\n\nThe differential diagnosis might include:\n- Toxoplasmosis (typically multiple lesions)\n- Brain abscess\n- Glioma\n- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (typically non-enhancing)\n\nTreatment typically involves:\n- Antiretroviral therapy\n- High-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy\n- Radiation therapy in some cases\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.

Specifically:\n\nKey points:\n1. The infant should receive zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks\n2. The mother's viral load >50 copies/mL indicates higher transmission risk, so additional antiretroviral medication (nevirapine) is also recommended\n\nRationale:\n- Even with maternal antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, there remains a risk of HIV transmission to the infant\n- Early initiation of prophylaxis is crucial for preventing HIV infection in exposed newborns\n- The mother's viral load >50 copies/mL near delivery indicates incomplete viral suppression\n- The timing of prophylaxis initiation is critical; it should begin as soon as possible after birth\n\nAdditional management should include:\n- Avoiding breastfeeding\n- HIV testing of infant at birth, 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4-6 months\n- Regular monitoring for medication side effects\n- Close follow-up with pediatric HIV specialist\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated.
