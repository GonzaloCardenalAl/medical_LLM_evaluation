It is calculated as the number of true negative results divided by the total number of negative results.\n\n### Study Overview:\n- The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS and 250 patients without AIDS.\n- The novel screening examination was performed on all patients.\n\n### Key Findings:\n- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):** 240 / (240 + 250) = 240 / 490 \u2248 0.49 (or 49%)\n- **Specificity (True Negative Rate):** 245 / (245 + 5) = 245 / 250 \u2248 0.98 (or 98%)\n\n### Calculating NPV:\n- **True Negative Results:** 245\n- **Total Negative Results:** 245 + 5 = 250\n\n### NPV Formula:\nNPV = (True Negative Results) / (Total Negative Results)\nNPV = 245 / 250 \u2248 0.98 (or 98%)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 98%.\n    Target answer: The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination.

The patient's HIV status, history of pneumonia, and geographical location (the Southwest United States) are risk factors for this infection. The next best step in management is to obtain a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for Coccidioidal meningitis. If the LP reveals elevated protein and low glucose, the diagnosis can be confirmed with an antibody test. The patient should be started on empiric treatment with fluconazole, which is the first-line treatment for Coccidioidal meningitis. Itraconazole is not the first-line treatment for Coccidioidal meningitis.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Additionally, he has been experiencing cognitive decline over the past 6 months, including forgetfulness, difficulty with spatial navigation, and trouble operating simple appliances. He has also developed paranoid, agitated, and restless behavior.\n\n### Medical History\n\nThe patient has a history of HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, he has been noncompliant with his medications and has not visited a physician in over 2 years.\n\n### Physical Examination\n\n*   **Vital Signs:** Temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 152/68 mmHg, pulse 98/min, respirations 14/min\n*   **Neurological Examination:**\n    *   Right lower extremity weakness with normal tone\n    *   No other focal deficits\n\n### Laboratory Studies\n\n*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**\n    *   Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL (indicative of anemia)\n    *   Leukocyte count 3600/mm3 (mild leukopenia)\n    *   Platelet count 140,000/mm3 (mild thrombocytopenia)\n*   **CD4+ Count:** 56/\u03bcL (indicative of advanced immunosuppression)\n*   **HIV Viral Load:** > 100,000 copies/mL (indicative of uncontrolled HIV infection)\n*   **Serum Studies:**\n    *   Cryptococcal antigen negative (ruling out cryptococcal meningitis)\n    *   Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive (indicative of past exposure to Toxoplasma gondii)\n*   **MRI of the Brain:**\n    *   Disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions\n    *   No mass effect\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory studies, the differential diagnosis includes:\n\n*   **HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD):** Also known as AIDS dementia complex, this condition is a direct result of HIV infection and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and behavioral changes.\n*   **Cerebral Toxoplasmosis:** A common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV infection, characterized by ring-enhancing lesions on MRI.\n*   **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** A rare and often fatal demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, characterized by nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI.\n*   **Cryptococcal Meningitis:** A fungal infection that can cause meningitis and encephalitis in immunocompromised patients, characterized by elevated intracranial pressure and ring-enhancing lesions on MRI.\n\n### Most Likely Diagnosis\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, laboratory studies, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).**\n\n### Explanation\n\nPML is a rare and often fatal demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which is usually latent in the brain but can reactivate in immunocompromised patients. The patient's advanced immunosuppression (CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL), uncontrolled HIV infection, and disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI are all consistent with PML.\n\n### Key Features\n\n*   **Nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI:** This is a hallmark feature of PML, which distinguishes it from other conditions such as cerebral toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal meningitis.\n*   **Advanced immunosuppression:** Patients with PML typically have a CD4+ count below 200/\u03bcL, which is consistent with the patient's CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL.\n*   **Uncontrolled HIV infection:** The patient's high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) suggests uncontrolled HIV infection, which is a risk factor for PML.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, laboratory studies, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases.

The biopsy shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which are characteristic findings in Bacillary Angiomatosis.\n\n### Pharmacotherapy\n\nFor the treatment of Bacillary Angiomatosis, **Doxycycline** is the recommended initial pharmacotherapy. Doxycycline is effective against *Bartonella henselae* and has a good safety profile. \n\n### Alternative Treatment Options\n\n- **Azithromycin** is another suitable alternative for patients who are unable to take doxycycline.\n- **Erythromycin** can be used as an alternative, but it has less favorable pharmacokinetics compared to azithromycin and doxycycline.\n\n### Hospital's Standard Treatment\n\nThe hospital's standard treatment using **Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine** is not suitable for this patient. These medications are typically used to treat Toxoplasmosis, a different opportunistic infection.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient with Bacillary Angiomatosis is **Doxycycline**, with azithromycin and erythromycin as alternative options.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin.\n    Background Question: A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain.

His medical records indicate inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) until one month ago, when he started taking his medications regularly, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\n### Clinical Findings\n\n- **Vital Signs**: Within normal limits\n- **Neurological Examination**: Ataxia and apathy\n- **Mini-Mental State Examination**: 15/30 (indicative of cognitive impairment)\n- **Laboratory Studies**:\n  - Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL\n  - Leukocyte count: 8400/mm\u00b3\n  - Segmented neutrophils: 80%\n  - Eosinophils: 1%\n  - Lymphocytes: 17%\n  - Monocytes: 2%\n  - CD4+ T-lymphocytes: 90/\u03bcL\n  - Platelet count: 328,000/mm\u00b3\n- **MRI Brain with Contrast**: A solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, measuring 4.5 cm in diameter\n- **Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis**: Slight pleocytosis, PCR positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe patient's presentation is similar to a recent case of Glioblastoma, but the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggest a different diagnosis.\n\n### Most Likely Diagnosis\n\n**Primary CNS Lymphoma**\n\nPrimary CNS lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the brain and/or eyes. It is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Ring-enhancing lesions**: Typically seen on MRI of the brain with contrast\n- **Low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count**: Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which are crucial for immune surveillance and killing of virus-infected cells, are depleted in HIV/AIDS patients, increasing the risk of primary CNS lymphoma\n- **Epstein-Barr virus infection**: A common cause of primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompromised patients\n- **Ocular involvement**: Not mentioned in this case, but can occur in primary CNS lymphoma\n\n### Treatment\n\n- **High-dose glucocorticoids**: To reduce intracranial pressure and edema\n- **Chemotherapy**: Methotrexate and cytarabine are often used to treat primary CNS lymphoma\n- **Targeted radiation therapy**: May be used in combination with chemotherapy\n\n### Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for primary CNS lymphoma is generally poor, with a median survival of about 2 months without treatment.\n    Target answer: The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.

The newborn is now exposed to HIV.\n\n#### Initial Management:\nThe initial management of the newborn involves administering antiretroviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n#### Recommended Regimen:\nThe recommended regimen for the newborn is zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. However, the most critical step is to administer zidovudine to the newborn.\n\n#### Importance of Zidovudine:\nZidovudine is administered to the newborn as soon as possible after delivery, ideally within 6-12 hours. This is because zidovudine has been shown to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 50-60%.\n\n#### Other Antiretrovirals:\nLamivudine and nevirapine are also administered as part of the regimen, but zidovudine is the most critical component.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer zidovudine as soon as possible after delivery.\n\n### Answer:\nAdminister zidovudine as soon as possible after delivery.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities.
