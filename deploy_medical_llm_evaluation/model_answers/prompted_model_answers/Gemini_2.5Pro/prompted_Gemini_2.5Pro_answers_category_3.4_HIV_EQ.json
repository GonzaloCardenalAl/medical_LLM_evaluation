Given his very low CD4 count (65 cells/uL), opportunistic infections, especially those affecting the central nervous system (CNS), are highly likely.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management, after initial stabilization and basic laboratory workup (including blood cultures), is to **urgently evaluate the cause of the fever and confusion, particularly focusing on CNS pathology**.\n\nThis evaluation should include **imaging of the brain (CT head)** to rule out mass lesions or hydrocephalus before performing a lumbar puncture, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions like cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or other CNS infections common in this setting. Lumbar puncture with appropriate CSF analysis (cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, culture, India ink, cryptococcal antigen, PCR for common pathogens like CMV, EBV, JC virus) would follow if the CT is unremarkable or does not contraindicate it.\n\nTherefore, the most direct answer to \"What is the most appropriate next step in management?\" after initial stabilization and basic labs are underway is to **order a CT scan of the head followed by a lumbar puncture**.\n    Target answer: The most appropriate next step in management is a neurological exam with fundoscopy.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion.

The differential diagnoses include stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), opportunistic CNS infections (such as Toxoplasmosis, PCNSL, Cryptococcoma, CNS TB), and other structural lesions.\n\nThe immediate next step in the emergency department for a patient with acute neurological symptoms is brain imaging to differentiate between these possibilities, particularly to rule out hemorrhage and identify any mass lesions.\n\nThe most appropriate initial imaging study in this setting is a non-contrast CT scan of the head. This can rapidly identify intracranial hemorrhage, large ischemic infarcts, and some mass lesions. This information is crucial for guiding subsequent management, including determining if further imaging (like MRI with contrast) or procedures (like lumbar puncture, which may be contraindicated with mass effect) are needed.\n\nTherefore, the next best step in management is **obtain a non-contrast CT head**.\n    Target answer: The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72.

This occurs when the recovering immune system, stimulated by antiretroviral therapy (ART), mounts an exaggerated inflammatory response to existing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* antigens.\n\nThe key features supporting this diagnosis are:\n1.  Patient with advanced HIV and active TB started ATT and ART.\n2.  Clinical worsening (fever, increased cough, lymphadenopathy) occurring after ART initiation, despite initial improvement on ATT and apparent microbiological control (negative sputum smear).\n3.  Evidence of immune recovery (significant increase in CD4 count and decrease in viral load).\n4.  New or worsening radiographic findings (pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy).\n5.  Conversion of Mantoux test (reflecting restored immune response to tuberculin).\n\nThe most appropriate initial step in managing symptomatic, non-life-threatening paradoxical TB-IRIS is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy, and to add a course of corticosteroids to reduce the excessive inflammation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to **administer corticosteroids**.\n    Target answer: Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

The symptoms of fatigue and nausea can be consistent with uremia or volume overload related to kidney disease. While morbid obesity and remote heroin use are risk factors for other forms of FSGS, HIVAN is the classic and most likely diagnosis in this specific context.\n    Target answer: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago.

This treatment is aimed at eradicating the *Treponema pallidum* infection and preventing further damage. It **does not reverse** the structural damage that has already occurred to the aortic valve or nervous system. Managing the consequences of the damage (like heart failure symptoms from severe aortic regurgitation) requires separate interventions, potentially including surgery.\n    Target answer: A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact.
