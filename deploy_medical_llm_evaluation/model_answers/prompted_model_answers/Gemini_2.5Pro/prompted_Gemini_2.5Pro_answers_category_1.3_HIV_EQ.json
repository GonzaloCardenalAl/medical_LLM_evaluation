They are highly accurate and can detect infection relatively early.\n2.  **Antibody Tests:** These older tests look only for HIV antibodies. They are also accurate but may take longer after exposure to become positive. Rapid tests often fall into this category.\n3.  **RNA Tests:** These tests look for the virus's genetic material. They are used to diagnose very early infection or to confirm other test results.\n\nA positive initial test always requires a confirmatory test to ensure an accurate diagnosis.\n    Target answer: HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

There are generally considered to be three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, within 2-4 weeks after infection. Some people experience flu-like symptoms, while others have none. The virus is multiplying rapidly.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** In this stage, the virus is still active but reproduces at a much slower rate. People may not have symptoms for many years. With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades and may never progress to Stage 3.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when HIV has severely damaged the immune system. It is defined by a very low CD4 count (below 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, survival is typically about three years at this stage.\n\nIt's important to remember that with proper medical care and ART, people living with HIV can often prevent progression to Stage 3 and live long, healthy lives.\n    Target answer: The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\n    Background Question: How can HIV be prevented?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

Starting and maintaining effective ART during pregnancy, labor, and delivery significantly reduces the mother's viral load, making transmission much less likely.\n2.  **Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for the Infant:** Giving ART to the newborn baby for a period after birth further reduces the risk, even if the mother was on ART.\n3.  **Optimizing Delivery Method:** While vaginal delivery is often safe when the mother's viral load is suppressed, a planned cesarean section may be recommended if the mother's viral load is high near delivery.\n4.  **Infant Feeding Choices:** Avoiding breastfeeding is recommended in settings where safe, affordable formula feeding is available, as breastfeeding can transmit HIV.\n\nUsing these strategies, perinatal transmission rates can be reduced to less than 1%.\n    Target answer: To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

This state is maintained primarily because the host cell is in a resting or quiescent state.\n\nThe \"switch\" to active infection, leading to viral replication, is primarily triggered by **cellular activation**. When a latently infected cell becomes activated (e.g., by encountering an antigen, cytokines, or other stimuli), intracellular signaling pathways are initiated.\n\nThese signaling pathways, particularly those involving transcription factors like NF-kB, can bind to the HIV promoter region (the LTR - Long Terminal Repeat) integrated in the host cell's DNA. This binding turns on the transcription of viral genes, leading to the production of viral RNA and proteins, assembly of new virions, and ultimately, active viral replication.\n\nSo, the transition from latency to active infection is largely driven by the activation state of the infected cell, which provides the necessary cellular environment and transcription factors to initiate viral gene expression. These latent reservoirs are a major challenge for achieving an HIV cure.\n    Target answer: The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
