Only a limited number of antiretroviral drugs were available, and standard treatment typically involved monotherapy (using a single drug), not combinations of multiple drugs, let alone five.\n\nThe most frequently administered and widely available antiretroviral drug in 1990, both in Switzerland and globally, was **Zidovudine (AZT)**.\n\nOther drugs were either not yet approved, only available in clinical trials, or not yet standard practice for combination therapy, which became common much later in the 1990s. Therefore, it's not possible to list five \"most frequently administered\" drugs as only one (AZT) fits that description for that year.\n    Target answer: The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

While overall birth rates for countries like Switzerland are standard demographic data, statistics bodies typically report the birth rate for the *entire* population or by broader demographics, not specifically broken down and compared between women *with* HIV and women *without* HIV.\n\nPublic health data in Switzerland would track the number of people living with HIV, and data related to births to women with HIV (like mother-to-child transmission rates), but it doesn't usually calculate and publish a specific \"birth rate\" (live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age) *solely for the group of women with HIV* compared directly to that *solely for the group of women without HIV*.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide you with a figure showing the difference in *overall birth rate* specifically between these two distinct groups for 2020, as this specific statistic is not routinely compiled or publicly available in that format.\n    Target answer:  Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
