Antiretroviral therapy was in its very early stages.\n\nAt that time, **zidovudine (AZT)** was essentially the *only* widely available and frequently administered antiretroviral drug.\n\nOther drugs like didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC) were still in clinical trials or had not yet received regulatory approval.\n\nTherefore, the concept of listing the \"five most frequently administered\" antiretroviral drugs in 1990 is not applicable. There were nowhere near five distinct antiretroviral drugs in common use at that time. Treatment primarily involved monotherapy with AZT.\n    Target answer: The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

While data exists on the general birth rate in Switzerland for 2010, and data is collected on pregnancies and births among women with HIV for clinical and public health monitoring (like preventing mother-to-child transmission), a direct comparison of the *overall population birth rate* specifically calculated for the entire female population split precisely by HIV status (women with HIV vs. women without HIV) for a single year like 2010 is not a standard public health statistic that is commonly compiled or readily available.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a specific number comparing the overall birth rates for these two distinct populations in that year. Data on pregnancies and births in women with HIV usually focuses on outcomes within that group, rather than calculating a comparative population-level birth rate.\n    Target answer: Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV.\n    Background Question: Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

While a very high proportion report >95% adherence, some patients still report missing doses. The exact proportion of *visits* where a patient reports missing *at least one dose per month* is not a standard metric often published, as adherence is usually reported per patient over a period.\n\nHowever, we know that 100% self-reported adherence is not universal. A significant majority report excellent adherence (>95%), meaning the proportion reporting *less than 100%* adherence (which includes missing just one dose per month) is larger than the proportion reporting less than 95% adherence, but still likely represents a minority of patients at any given time. Precise, universally applicable figures for \"proportion of visits\" are not readily available in published literature in this specific format.\n    Target answer: Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

Data linking the age at first positive HIV test (<20 years) *specifically* to those who *died from HIV-related causes* in Switzerland is not a standard statistic that is regularly published or easily accessible in general reports.\n\nWhile Swiss public health bodies and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study collect detailed data on HIV diagnoses, mortality, and causes of death, calculating this precise proportion requires specific analysis of those datasets. It is not a figure I can provide based on readily available information.\n    Target answer: Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

It would depend on the specific findings from analyses of that particular dataset.\n    Target answer: Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
