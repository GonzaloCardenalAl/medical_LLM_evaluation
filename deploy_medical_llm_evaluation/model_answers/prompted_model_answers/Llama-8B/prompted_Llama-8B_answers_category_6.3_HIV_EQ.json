However, I can provide some context and information from related studies.\n\nA 2019 Swiss HIV Cohort Study found that among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland, about 15% reported experiencing stigma or discrimination. However, this study didn't specifically ask about feeling like outcasts.\n\nA 2020 survey conducted by the Swiss HIV Association (SHIA) found that 21% of PLWH reported experiencing stigma or discrimination in their daily lives. However, it's essential to note that this survey didn't specifically ask about feeling like outcasts.\n\nWhile these studies don't provide a direct answer to your question, they suggest that a significant proportion of PLWH in Switzerland may experience some level of stigma or discrimination. However, I couldn't find a specific figure for feeling like outcasts.\n    Target answer: As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "

For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s and target answers.\"\n    }\n    "
