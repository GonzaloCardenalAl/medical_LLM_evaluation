This omission results in a score of 3. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly clear, but the student does not explain the rationale behind the sequence of tests or the importance of the window period, leading to a score of 3. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the types of tests and their functions, earning a score of 4, but misses the specific details about the window periods. For question 4, the student uses neutral and unbiased language, scoring a 5.

Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning is clear and follows a logical progression, but the omission of the symptomatic stage slightly affects the completeness, warranting a score of 4. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the stages and the impact of ART, but the omission of the symptomatic stage is a minor factual gap, leading to a score of 4. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity throughout the explanation, earning a perfect score of 5. In question 5, the student emphasizes the importance of ART in delaying or preventing progression to AIDS, demonstrating safety-oriented thinking, which justifies a score of 5.
