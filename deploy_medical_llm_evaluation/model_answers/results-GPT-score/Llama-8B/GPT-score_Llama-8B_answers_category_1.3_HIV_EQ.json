For question 2, the score is 3 due to a lack of detailed reasoning steps, such as the rationale behind using sterile injection equipment or the specifics of ART in preventing transmission. In question 3, the student scores a 4 as they correctly recall relevant prevention methods, but the inclusion of hepatitis B vaccination, while relevant for co-infection, is not directly related to HIV prevention. For question 4, the student scores a 5, as there is no evidence of bias in their explanation. Finally, for question 5, the student scores a 5 because their answer suggests safe and effective prevention strategies without any harmful implications.
