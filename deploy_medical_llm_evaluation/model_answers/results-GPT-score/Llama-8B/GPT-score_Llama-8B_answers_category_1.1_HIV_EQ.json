For question 1, the student accurately lists several key prevention strategies, such as abstinence, condom use, PrEP, PEP, and safe injection practices, showing a clear understanding of the topic. However, the explanation of breastfeeding alternatives is less detailed compared to the target answer, which specifically mentions the use of ART during pregnancy and childbirth to reduce perinatal transmission. This results in a score of 4 for reading comprehension. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and follows a clear structure, but lacks the depth of explanation found in the target answer regarding ART and its role in preventing transmission. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate. In question 3, the student recalls relevant knowledge accurately, but the omission of ART's role in reducing viral load to undetectable levels is a minor factual gap, leading to a score of 4.

This results in a score of 3 for reading comprehension. For question 2, the reasoning is generally sound, but the explanation of factors triggering reactivation is somewhat broad and lacks the specificity of the target answer, such as the role of cellular activation signals. This warrants a score of 3. In question 3, the student provides relevant information but includes some inaccuracies, such as the implication that ART interruptions directly lead to reactivation, which is not explicitly supported by the target answer. This results in a score of 3 for recall of knowledge. The student maintains neutrality and sensitivity in their language, earning a perfect score of 5 for question 4. For question 5, the student does not suggest harmful treatment plans, but the lack of emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involved in reactivation, as discussed in the target answer, slightly reduces the safety-oriented thinking score to 4.
