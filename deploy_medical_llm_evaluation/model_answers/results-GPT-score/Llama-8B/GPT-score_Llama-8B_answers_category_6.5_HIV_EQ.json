This results in a score of 2 for reading comprehension. The reasoning steps are somewhat logical but lack clarity and direct relevance to the question, leading to a score of 2.

In question 3, the student demonstrates knowledge of HIV transmission but introduces irrelevant details about specific populations, earning a score of 3.
