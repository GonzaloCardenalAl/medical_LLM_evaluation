For question 2, the reasoning is unclear and lacks specificity, as the student does not provide a clear rationale for the drugs mentioned and incorrectly states the availability of saquinavir. For question 3, the student recalls some correct drugs but also includes incorrect information about saquinavir and omits key drugs from the target answer.
