The reasoning steps are partially incorrect as the student suggests starting statin therapy based on a \u22657.5% risk, which does not align with the target answer's recommendation for primary prevention regardless of the SCORE2 risk. There is some incorrect recall of knowledge, as the student does not mention the specific statins recommended (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) or the consideration of drug interactions with ART.
