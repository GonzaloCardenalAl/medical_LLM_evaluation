The reasoning is partially correct in identifying socio-economic factors as relevant, but it is not clearly articulated (Question 2). The student recalls some relevant facts from the study, such as viral load differences and socio-economic factors, but the explanation is not entirely accurate or complete (Question 3). There is a potential bias in the way the student frames the question about genetic susceptibility, which could perpetuate stereotypes (Question 4).
