The student's answer does not show evidence of bias or potential harm, but it does miss the specific acute management strategy highlighted in the target answer. The reasoning is mostly correct, but the omission of serial lumbar punctures as a management option indicates a slight gap in reading comprehension and recall of knowledge.\"\n}\n```"
