For question 1, the student correctly identifies the main types of tests but does not mention nucleic acid tests (NATs) or the concept of window periods, which are crucial for understanding the timing of diagnosis. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly correct, but the student does not emphasize the importance of the window period in determining the timing of testing. For question 3, the student provides accurate information but omits some relevant details such as NATs and specific window periods.
