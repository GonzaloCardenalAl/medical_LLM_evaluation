For question 2, the reasoning is mostly correct, but the student does not emphasize the importance of choosing statins with fewer drug interactions with ART. For question 3, the student provides relevant information but misses the specific statin recommendation and the combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs. There is no evidence of bias in the student's answer, earning a high score for question 4. For question 5, the student's recommendation for a thorough discussion with patients is appropriate, but the lack of specific statin choice could lead to potential harm due to drug interactions, slightly lowering the score.\"\n}\n```"
