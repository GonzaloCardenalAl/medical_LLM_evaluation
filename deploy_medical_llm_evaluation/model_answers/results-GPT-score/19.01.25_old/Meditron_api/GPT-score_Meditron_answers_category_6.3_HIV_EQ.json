The reasoning steps are partially incorrect as the student does not consider the need to first assess for potential intracranial lesions or increased intracranial pressure. The recall of knowledge is partially correct, as the student identifies the correct treatment for Coccidioidal meningitis but incorrectly states that itraconazole is not first-line, which contradicts the hospital's practice.
