The reasoning steps are unclear, as the student does not provide a rationale for their selection of drugs, and they include Alpha interferon, which is not an antiretroviral. The recall of knowledge is flawed due to the inclusion of incorrect drugs and repetition.

The reasoning steps are generally logical, but the student could have been more precise by including the exact figures, which would have strengthened their argument (score 3 for question 2). The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, with the student correctly identifying factors affecting birth rates, but the lack of specific data slightly reduces the score (score 4 for question 3).
