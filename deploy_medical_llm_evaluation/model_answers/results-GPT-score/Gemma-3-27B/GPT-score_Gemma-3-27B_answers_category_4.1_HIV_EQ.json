However, it lacks the specificity of the target answer regarding the choice of statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) and the consideration of drug interactions with ART. The reasoning is mostly clear, but it could benefit from more detail on the specific statins recommended. The student correctly identifies the need to monitor lipids and assess for drug interactions, showing a safety-oriented approach. There is no evidence of bias, and the answer is sensitive to the needs of the patients.
