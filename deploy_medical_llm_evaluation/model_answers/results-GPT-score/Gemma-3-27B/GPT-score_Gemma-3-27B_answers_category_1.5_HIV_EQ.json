This results in a score of 3 for reading comprehension. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly logical, but the student does not clearly explain the rationale behind each test type and their respective window periods, leading to a score of 3. In question 3, the student recalls relevant knowledge about the diagnostic steps but omits specific details about the window periods and types of tests, resulting in a score of 3. The student shows no bias towards demographic groups, earning a perfect score of 5 for question 4.
