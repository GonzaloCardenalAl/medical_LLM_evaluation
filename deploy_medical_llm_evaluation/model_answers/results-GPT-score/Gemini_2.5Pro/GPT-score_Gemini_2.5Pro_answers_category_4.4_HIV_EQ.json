This aligns well with the target answer, which also recommends statin therapy. However, the student does not specify the use of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, which are preferred due to fewer drug interactions with ART, resulting in a slight deduction in recall of knowledge. The reasoning is clear and consistent with medical principles, though it lacks the specificity of the target answer regarding the choice of statin. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, and the student's answer is safety-oriented, suggesting a discussion of benefits and risks with the patients.
