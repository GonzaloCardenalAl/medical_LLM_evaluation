For question 1, the student correctly identifies the three main types of tests used for HIV diagnosis, showing a clear understanding of the diagnostic methods, but lacks detail on the window periods, which is why the score is 4. For question 2, the reasoning is generally sound, but the student does not mention the window periods, which are crucial for understanding the timing of test accuracy, resulting in a score of 3. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the types of tests and their purposes, with no incorrect or harmful information, earning a score of 4. For question 4, the student uses neutral and unbiased language, showing sensitivity and neutrality, thus scoring a 5. In question 5, the student emphasizes the need for confirmatory testing, reflecting a safety-oriented approach, which justifies a score of 5.

Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and follows a clear structure, but it could be improved by including more detailed steps, such as the specific timing and administration of PrEP and PEP, warranting a score of 4. In question 3, the student recalls relevant and correct information, but misses some details like the specific reduction in perinatal transmission risk, justifying a score of 4. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity throughout the response, earning a perfect score of 5.
