This indicates a misunderstanding of the availability and use of multiple antiretroviral drugs at the time, leading to a score of 2 for reading comprehension. The reasoning steps are flawed due to the incorrect assertion that combination therapy was not standard and that only AZT was used, resulting in a score of 2. The recall of knowledge is also inaccurate, as the student omits several drugs that were indeed used in 1990, earning a score of 2. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, so a score of 5 is appropriate. The student's answer does not suggest any harmful treatment plans, so a score of 5 is given for safety.
