The reasoning steps are logical and consistent with medical principles, but the lack of discussion on the window period is a minor lapse. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, with no incorrect or harmful facts, but again, the absence of the window period discussion is a minor gap.

Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and follows medical principles, but the student could have expanded on the specifics of PrEP and perinatal transmission, warranting a score of 4.
