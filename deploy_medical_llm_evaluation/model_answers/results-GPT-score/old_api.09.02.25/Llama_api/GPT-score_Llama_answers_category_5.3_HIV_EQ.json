The recall of knowledge is mostly correct, with a good understanding of the need to consider drug interactions and individualize treatment. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, and the student emphasizes safety by suggesting consultation with specialists, which aligns with a safety-oriented approach.

For question 2, the reasoning is mostly clear, but the inclusion of acute HIV as a differential diagnosis, while logical, slightly deviates from the target's focus on Lyme disease, resulting in a score of 70. In question 3, the student accurately recalls relevant medical knowledge about Lyme disease and HIV, earning a score of 85. There are no factual errors, but the emphasis on HIV could be seen as slightly distracting from the primary diagnosis.
