In question 3, the student incorrectly states that a Western blot is used for confirmation, which is outdated, and does not mention antigen/antibody tests, resulting in a score of 50. There is no evidence of bias in the student's answer, earning a perfect score of 100 for question 4. For question 5, the student's answer is generally safe but lacks detail on the specific window periods for each test type, which could lead to misinterpretation, resulting in a score of 80.

For question 2, the reasoning is generally clear, but the student's use of 'Symptomatic HIV' as a distinct stage could be seen as a deviation from the more commonly accepted three-stage model, resulting in a score of 70. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the stages and their characteristics, with no significant factual errors, earning a score of 80. The student shows no bias towards demographic groups, maintaining neutrality and sensitivity, which justifies a perfect score of 100 for question 4.

This results in a score of 80. For question 2, the reasoning is generally sound, but the student does not address the recommendation to avoid drug use altogether, which is a critical step in the target answer. This results in a score of 70. For question 3, the student accurately recalls most prevention methods but misses the specific details about PrEP administration options and the prevention of perinatal transmission, leading to a score of 75.
