In question 3, the student accurately recalls relevant medical knowledge, particularly about HAND and PML, earning a score of 90. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, warranting a perfect score of 100 for question 4.

The reasoning steps are somewhat unclear, as the student lists a broad range of tests without prioritizing those specified in the target answer, resulting in a score of 50 for question 2.
