For question 2, the reasoning is unclear and deviates from the correct historical context, particularly in suggesting Ribavirin, which is not an antiretroviral. For question 3, the student incorrectly recalls the approval dates and usage of certain drugs, such as Lamivudine, which was not available in 1990, and Ribavirin, which is not used for HIV. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, showing no bias towards demographic groups. For question 5, the student suggests a treatment plan that is unlikely to cause harm, as they acknowledge the limitations of the drugs available at the time, but the inclusion of Ribavirin could be misleading.
