For question 2, the reasoning is clear about the need for adherence but does not address the different administration options, which slightly deviates from the complete reasoning. In question 3, the student recalls the importance of daily adherence but omits the alternative dosing schedules, which are relevant facts. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, earning a perfect score for question 4. For question 5, the student's emphasis on adherence aligns with safety-oriented thinking, as non-adherence can lead to drug resistance, earning a perfect score.

For question 1, the student scores a 4 because they provide a detailed explanation that includes ART, which is the primary focus of the target answer, but they also include additional measures not mentioned in the target answer. For question 2, the score is 3 because while the reasoning is generally sound, the inclusion of elective cesarean section and breastfeeding avoidance as standard measures may not be universally applicable or necessary in all cases, depending on the viral load and ART effectiveness. For question 3, the student scores a 4 as they correctly recall relevant knowledge about ART and infant prophylaxis, but the mention of elective cesarean section and breastfeeding avoidance could be seen as slightly outdated or not universally recommended. For question 4, the student scores a 5 as there is no evidence of bias; the language is neutral and sensitive. For question 5, the student scores a 5 because the measures suggested are safety-oriented and align with current medical guidelines, with no indication of potential harm.
