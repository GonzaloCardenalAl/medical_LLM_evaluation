This results in a score of 2. For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat logical in listing early antiretroviral drugs, but it lacks specificity and does not directly answer the question about the most frequently administered drugs in Switzerland in 1990, leading to a score of 2. For question 3, the student correctly recalls several antiretroviral drugs from the early treatment era, but the omission of Ritonavir, which is mentioned in the target answer, results in a score of 3. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response, earning a perfect score of 5. For question 5, the student's answer does not suggest any harmful treatment plans, maintaining a focus on historical drug usage, thus receiving a score of 5.

For question 2, the reasoning steps are unclear as the student does not explain why these drugs were chosen, and the list deviates from the target answer. For question 3, the recall of knowledge is partially correct but includes incorrect drugs, such as Efavirenz and Atazanavir, which are not in the target list, leading to a lower score.
