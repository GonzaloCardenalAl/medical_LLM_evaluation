For question 3, the student incorrectly recalls the testing methods, focusing on older tests and not mentioning the window periods or the newer tests like NATs, which are crucial for early detection. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's answer, hence a perfect score. For question 5, while the student suggests confirmatory testing, the outdated focus on Western blot could lead to less effective diagnosis, but the overall approach is safety-oriented, hence a high score.\"\n}\n```"
