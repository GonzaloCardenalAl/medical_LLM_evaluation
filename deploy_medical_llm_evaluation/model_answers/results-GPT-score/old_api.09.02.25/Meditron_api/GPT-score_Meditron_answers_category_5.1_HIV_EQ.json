Thus, a score of 60 is given. For question 2, the student's reasoning is partially correct in considering HIV as a risk factor but fails to align with the target answer's clear recommendation to start statin therapy, resulting in a score of 50. In question 3, the student correctly identifies the increased CVD risk in HIV patients and the need for aggressive assessment but does not mention the specific statins recommended (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) or the combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs, leading to a score of 70. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, earning a perfect score of 100. In question 5, the student suggests consulting specialists, which is safety-oriented, but does not directly recommend starting statin therapy as the target answer does, resulting in a score of 80.

The student's reasoning lacks clarity and deviates from the correct reasoning by not recognizing the potential interaction and the need for a regimen change.
