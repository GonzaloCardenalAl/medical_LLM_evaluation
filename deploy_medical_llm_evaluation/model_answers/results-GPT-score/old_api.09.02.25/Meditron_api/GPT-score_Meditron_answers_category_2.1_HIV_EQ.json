The reasoning is mostly clear, but the omission of drug use indicates a slight deviation from the complete reasoning expected, leading to a score of 70 for question 2. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, as sexual transmission is indeed a major source, but the exclusion of drug use results in a score of 80 for question 3.
