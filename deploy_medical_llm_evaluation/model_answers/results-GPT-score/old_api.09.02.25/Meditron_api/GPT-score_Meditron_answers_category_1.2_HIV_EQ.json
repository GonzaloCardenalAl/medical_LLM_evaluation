For question 1, the student correctly identifies the use of blood tests and the importance of confirmation but does not mention the different types of tests or the concept of the window period, which are crucial for a complete understanding. Thus, a score of 60 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat clear but lacks the detailed steps and differentiation between test types and their respective window periods, warranting a score of 50. In question 3, the student fails to mention the specific types of tests and their detection windows, which are key factual elements, resulting in a score of 40. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, earning a perfect score of 100 for question 4.
