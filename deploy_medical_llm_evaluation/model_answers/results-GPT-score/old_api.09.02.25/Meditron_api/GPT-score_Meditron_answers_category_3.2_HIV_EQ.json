However, the student misinterprets the specific molecular process affected, focusing on redox balance instead of collagen synthesis, which is the target answer. Thus, a score of 60 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning steps deviate from the target answer by focusing on oxidative stress rather than collagen synthesis, which is the direct consequence of Vitamin C inactivation. This results in a score of 40. In question 3, the student correctly identifies Vitamin C as an antioxidant but incorrectly associates its inactivation primarily with oxidative stress rather than impaired collagen synthesis, leading to a score of 60. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response, warranting a perfect score of 100. In question 5, the student's answer does not suggest any harmful treatment plans, but the focus on oxidative stress could mislead clinical priorities, resulting in a score of 80.
