For question 1, the student correctly identifies blood tests as the method for diagnosing HIV but does not mention the different types of tests (antibody, antigen/antibody, NATs) or the concept of the window period, which affects the accuracy of the diagnosis. This results in a score of 3 for reading comprehension. For question 2, the reasoning steps are incomplete as the student does not explain the rationale behind using different tests or the importance of follow-up testing, leading to a score of 2. In question 3, the student mentions ELISA and Western blot tests, which are outdated and not typically used in current practice, indicating a lack of up-to-date knowledge, resulting in a score of 2.
