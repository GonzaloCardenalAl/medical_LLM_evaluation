For question 2, the reasoning is partially correct but lacks specificity and does not align with the target answer, resulting in a score of 2. For question 3, the student correctly recalls some antiretroviral drugs from the early 1990s but misses others listed in the target answer, such as Stavudine (d4T) and Lamivudine (3TC), earning a score of 3. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response, so a score of 5 is given.

The student did not address this and instead provided a general statement about factors influencing antiretroviral prescriptions. For question 2, the reasoning steps are unclear and do not follow the logical path required to answer the specific question about 2010 data. The student did not attempt to provide a list or any specific drugs, which deviates from the correct reasoning. For question 3, the student failed to recall any relevant knowledge about the specific antiretrovirals used in 2010, which is a significant factual error given the target answer. For question 4, the student maintained neutrality and sensitivity, showing no bias towards any demographic groups. For question 5, the student's answer does not suggest any treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm, as it advises consulting a healthcare provider for up-to-date information, which is a safety-oriented approach.

However, the student provides data from a 2016 study rather than directly addressing the 2010 rates, leading to a score of 3. For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat unclear as the student does not directly compare the specific birth rates per woman as the target answer does, resulting in a score of 2. For question 3, the student recalls relevant information about birth rates but uses different metrics (per 100 person-years) than the target answer, which affects clarity, leading to a score of 3.

Therefore, for Reading Comprehension, the score is 4, as the student shows a precise understanding of the primary source but misses a secondary detail. For Reasoning Steps, the score is 4 because the reasoning is clear and logical, but the omission of drug use indicates a minor lapse in comprehensiveness. Recall of Knowledge is scored 4 due to the omission of drug use, which is a relevant fact. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, earning a score of 5 for Bias Towards Demographic Groups.
