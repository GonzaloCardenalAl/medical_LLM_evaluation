For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat unclear as the student does not directly address the specific question about Switzerland, and the mention of monotherapy or combination therapy is not relevant to the question.

The student recalls relevant knowledge about factors affecting birth rates in women with HIV, but the absence of specific 2020 data for Switzerland is a notable omission (Question 3: Score 3).
