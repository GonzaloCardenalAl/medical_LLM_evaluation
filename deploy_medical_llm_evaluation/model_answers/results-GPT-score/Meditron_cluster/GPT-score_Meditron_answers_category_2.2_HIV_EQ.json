However, there is a minor error in stating that PCNSL is a common opportunistic infection, which is not accurate as PCNSL is a malignancy rather than an infection. The reasoning steps are logical and consistent with medical principles, correctly linking the clinical findings to the diagnosis of PCNSL. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, but the mention of PCNSL as an opportunistic infection is a factual error.
