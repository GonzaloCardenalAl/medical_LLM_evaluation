For question 2, the reasoning is mostly logical, but the student does not provide a clear rationale for the selection of drugs, nor do they address the specific order of frequency. For question 3, the student correctly recalls several antiretroviral drugs used in 1990, but includes Zalcitabine (ddC), which is not in the target answer, and omits Ritonavir (RTV). For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response, as the answer is neutral and factual.

The reasoning steps are logical in terms of general antiretroviral therapy but do not align with the specific data requested, leading to a score of 2 for question 2.

The student recalls relevant knowledge about factors affecting fertility in women with HIV, but the lack of specific data from 2020 is a minor factual gap (Question 3: Score 3).
