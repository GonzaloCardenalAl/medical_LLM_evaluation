This indicates a partial understanding of the question (score 3 for question 1). The reasoning steps are mostly logical, but the student does not explicitly state that the combination of XTC (emtricitabine) and TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) is not a recommended strategy, which is a critical point (score 3 for question 2).
