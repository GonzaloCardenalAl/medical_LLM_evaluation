For question 1, the score is 2 because the student demonstrates a general understanding of antiretroviral drugs but misidentifies the specific ones most frequently used in 2010. For question 2, the score is 2 due to the lack of clear reasoning in selecting the drugs mentioned, as they do not align with the target answer. For question 3, the score is 2 because the student recalls some correct drugs (lamivudine and tenofovir) but includes incorrect ones (efavirenz, atazanavir, nevirapine) and misses others (Dolutegravir, Emtricitabine). There is no evidence of bias in the student's answer, so question 4 scores a 5. The student's answer does not suggest any harmful treatment plans, so question 5 also scores a 5.
