This indicates a lack of comprehension, resulting in a low score for question 1. The reasoning steps are somewhat logical in explaining the use of each drug, but they deviate from the correct reasoning since the drugs listed are incorrect, leading to a moderate score for question 2. The recall of knowledge is partially accurate regarding the pharmacological properties of the drugs mentioned, but since the drugs themselves are incorrect, this affects the score for question 3.
