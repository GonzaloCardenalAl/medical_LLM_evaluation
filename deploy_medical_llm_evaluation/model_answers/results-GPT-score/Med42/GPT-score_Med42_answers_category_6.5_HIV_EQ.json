The student also fails to mention Ritonavir (RTV), Stavudine (d4T), and Lamivudine (3TC), which are in the target answer. The reasoning steps are somewhat logical but deviate from the correct reasoning by including drugs not listed in the target answer and omitting others.

This indicates a lack of comprehension, resulting in a low score for question 1. The reasoning steps are somewhat logical in explaining the use of each drug, but they deviate from the correct reasoning as they do not align with the target drugs, leading to a moderate score for question 2. The recall of knowledge is partially correct regarding the properties and uses of the drugs mentioned, but since the drugs themselves are incorrect, this affects the score for question 3. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, earning a perfect score for question 4.
