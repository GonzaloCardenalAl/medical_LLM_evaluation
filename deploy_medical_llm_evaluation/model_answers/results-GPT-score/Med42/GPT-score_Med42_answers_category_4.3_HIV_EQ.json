However, the student mentions a meta-analysis that did not stratify by CVD risk levels, which slightly affects the precision of the answer compared to the target answer that directly recommends statin use for primary prevention. For question 2, the student accurately describes drug-drug interactions with ART, particularly with PIs and NNRTIs, and suggests appropriate statins with fewer interactions, aligning well with the target answer. The reasoning is clear and consistent with medical principles, earning a high score. In question 3, the student justifies statin therapy by considering HIV as an independent risk factor and suggests careful evaluation of drug interactions, which is comprehensive and aligns with the target answer's recommendation of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. There is no evidence of bias in the student's language or reasoning, and the answer reflects a safety-oriented approach, particularly in monitoring potential side effects and interactions.
