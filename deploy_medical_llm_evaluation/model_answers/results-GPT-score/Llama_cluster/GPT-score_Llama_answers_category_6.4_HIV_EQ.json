The reasoning is mostly clear, suggesting the use of antiretroviral therapy as a factor for healthy pregnancies, but it deviates slightly by focusing on future recommendations rather than directly addressing the 2010 data (score 3 for question 2).

The reasoning steps are unclear because the student does not address the specific statistical difference provided in the target answer, leading to a deduction in score. The recall of knowledge is generally accurate regarding the role of ART and comprehensive care but lacks specificity and contains a factual error about the birth rate comparison.

The reasoning steps are mostly logical, but the focus on MSM deviates slightly from the broader categories mentioned in the target answer. The recall of knowledge is accurate regarding the epidemiological data, but the specificity of MSM could be seen as slightly misaligned with the target's broader categories.
