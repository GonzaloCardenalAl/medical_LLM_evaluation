The reasoning steps are flawed due to the incorrect association of the MRI findings and EBV PCR with PML rather than primary cerebral lymphoma. The recall of knowledge is also incorrect, as the student misattributes the MRI and CSF findings to PML. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, and the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity.

The student's reasoning is flawed as it does not address the specific mechanism of action required by the question. The recall of knowledge is incorrect, as lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), not a protease inhibitor or NNRTI.

This indicates a misunderstanding of the specific context of early diagnosis in newborns, affecting the reading comprehension score. The reasoning steps are flawed as the student incorrectly identifies NAAT as the gold standard for diagnosing HIV in pregnant women, which deviates from the correct reasoning for newborn testing. The recall of knowledge is partially correct but includes a factual error regarding the application of NAAT in this specific context.
