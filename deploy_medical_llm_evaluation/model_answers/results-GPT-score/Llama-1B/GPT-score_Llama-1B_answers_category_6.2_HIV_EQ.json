For example, they incorrectly list AZT as Zalcitabine, which is a different drug, and mention Lopinavir/Ritonavir, which was not widely used in 1990. The reasoning steps are unclear, as the student does not provide a rationale for their choices, and there is a deviation from the correct reasoning by including drugs not relevant to the 1990 context. The recall of knowledge is flawed due to the incorrect identification of drugs and the inclusion of drugs not pertinent to the time period. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, and the language used is neutral and sensitive. The severity/extent of possible harm is low, as the student does not suggest harmful treatment plans, but the inaccuracies could lead to misinformation if not corrected.

For question 2, the reasoning steps are unclear and inconsistent with the target answer, as the student lists drugs not mentioned in the target answer and provides no rationale for their selection. For question 3, the recall of knowledge is poor, with several incorrect drugs listed, such as 'Raltegravir (also known as Evotec)' and 'Ritonavir/ritonavir', and a lack of alignment with the target answer.
