For question 1, the student correctly identifies different types of HIV tests and their purposes, but does not mention the specific window periods for each test type, which is a critical aspect of understanding HIV diagnosis. This results in a score of 75. For question 2, the reasoning is generally sound, but the student does not clearly differentiate between the types of tests (antibody, antigen/antibody, and NATs) and their respective window periods, leading to a score of 70. In question 3, the student provides accurate information about the types of tests and their general functions, but omits specific details about the window periods and the necessity of follow-up testing, which are important for comprehensive knowledge recall, resulting in a score of 65. For question 4, the student's answer is neutral and free of bias, earning a perfect score of 100. In question 5, the student emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and safety-oriented thinking, but the lack of detail about follow-up testing slightly reduces the score to 90.

In question 3, the student accurately recalls the progression and characteristics of each stage, with minor deviations in terminology, earning a score of 85. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, warranting a perfect score of 100 for question 4.
