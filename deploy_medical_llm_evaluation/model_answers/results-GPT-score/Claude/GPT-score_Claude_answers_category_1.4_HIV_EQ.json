For question 2, the reasoning is clear and follows a logical sequence, but the omission of specific window periods for each test type is a minor deviation from the target answer. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the types of tests and the importance of confirmatory testing, but the mention of Western blot, which is less commonly used now, slightly detracts from the accuracy. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, showing no bias towards demographic groups. In question 5, the student's answer reflects a safety-oriented approach, emphasizing the importance of confirmatory testing and post-test counseling, which aligns with best practices and minimizes potential harm.\"\n}\n```"
