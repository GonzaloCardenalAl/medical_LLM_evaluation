For question 2, the reasoning is generally sound, but the student does not clearly differentiate between the types of tests and their specific window periods, which is a key aspect of the target answer. For question 3, the student accurately recalls the types of tests and the importance of confirmatory testing, but misses some specifics about the window periods for each test type. There is no evidence of bias in the student's answer, earning a perfect score for question 4. For question 5, the student's emphasis on confirmatory testing and counseling reflects a safety-oriented approach, justifying a high score.
