The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate regarding the timeline of antiretroviral drug availability, but it does not address the specific drugs listed in the target answer, resulting in a score of 3. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, so the student receives a perfect score of 5 in this category.

This results in a minor error affecting the interpretation, leading to a score of 3 for reading comprehension. The reasoning steps are mostly logical, but the omission of drug use as a source of transmission indicates a slight deviation from the complete reasoning expected, resulting in a score of 3. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, with the student correctly identifying sexual contact as a primary mode of transmission, earning a score of 4.
