However, the student fails to directly address the specific question about the top five antiretroviral drugs used in Switzerland in 1990, which affects the reading comprehension score. The reasoning steps are logical in explaining the challenges of identifying the top five drugs, but the student does not attempt to list any drugs beyond AZT, which is a deviation from the target answer. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, mentioning relevant drugs like AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T, but it lacks the inclusion of Lamivudine (3TC) and Ritonavir (RTV), which are part of the target answer.

The student incorrectly includes Efavirenz and Abacavir, and omits TAF and DTG. The reasoning steps are unclear as the student does not explain the rationale behind their selection, leading to a score of 2.

However, the student did not provide the specific birth rate figures as mentioned in the target answer, which affects the precision of their response, leading to a score of 3 for reading comprehension. The reasoning steps are logical, explaining potential factors for the lower birth rate among women with HIV, but the student could have strengthened their answer by directly referencing the statistical data provided in the target answer, resulting in a score of 3 for reasoning steps.

The reasoning steps are unclear because the student focuses on a subgroup rather than the general sources, which deviates from the correct reasoning, resulting in a score of 2.
