The target answer lists Ritonavir and Lamivudine, which the student does not mention. The reasoning steps are unclear as the student does not provide a logical basis for the inclusion of certain drugs over others, and there is a factual error in the timeline of drug approvals.

The reasoning steps are somewhat logical but lack clarity and completeness, as the student focuses on a subgroup rather than the general sources, resulting in a score of 2. The recall of knowledge is partially correct but incomplete, as it does not encompass all relevant sources of HIV infection, leading to a score of 2.
