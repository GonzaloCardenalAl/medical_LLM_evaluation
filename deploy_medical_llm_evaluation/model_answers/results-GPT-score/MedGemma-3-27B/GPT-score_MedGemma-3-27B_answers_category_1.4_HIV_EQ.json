For question 1, the student correctly identifies the three main types of tests (antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and NATs) and their purposes, but does not mention the window periods, which is a minor lapse in depth. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate. For question 2, the reasoning is clear and follows a logical sequence, but lacks the detail about window periods, which slightly affects the depth of understanding, warranting a score of 4. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the types of tests and their general use, but omits specific details about the window periods, which are important for understanding the timing of diagnosis, resulting in a score of 4. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, with no bias towards any demographic groups, earning a perfect score of 5.
