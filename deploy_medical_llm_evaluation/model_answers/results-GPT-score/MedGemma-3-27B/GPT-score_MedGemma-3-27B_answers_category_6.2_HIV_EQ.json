For question 2, the reasoning steps are somewhat unclear, as the student does not directly address the ranking of the drugs as requested in the target answer. For question 3, the student correctly identifies several antiretroviral drugs used in 1990, but incorrectly includes Foscarnet, which is primarily used for CMV retinitis, not as a first-line HIV treatment. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response, demonstrating neutrality and sensitivity. For question 5, the student acknowledges the limitations and side effects of the drugs, showing an awareness of safety concerns, but the inclusion of Foscarnet could potentially mislead regarding its use in HIV treatment.
