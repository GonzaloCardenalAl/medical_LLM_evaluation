The reasoning steps are generally logical, but the student could have strengthened their argument by providing more specific data or studies to support their claims about factors influencing birth rates (score 3 for question 2). The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, with relevant factors mentioned, but the lack of specific data from the target answer slightly reduces the score (score 4 for question 3).
