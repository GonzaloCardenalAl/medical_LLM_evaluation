    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's current condition is most likely due to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which is a complication of HIV infection that can lead to cognitive impairment, motor abnormalities, and other neurological deficits. Given her history of HIV, the low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L), and the MRI findings of hyperintense lesions consistent with demyelination, it is plausible that her neurological symptoms, including confusion, disorientation, and motor weakness, are related to HAND. Additionally, her irregular medication adherence may have contributed to the progression of her HIV and the development of these neurological complications. The presence of atypical astrocytes in the brain biopsy further supports a pathological process related to HIV.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient you are describing has been diagnosed with HIV and is being treated with a combination of antiretroviral medications, specifically lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir. Among these medications, indinavir is known to have pancreatitis as a potential adverse effect. \n\nGiven the patient's history and current treatment regimen, he is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Pancreatitis**: As you mentioned, indinavir can cause pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. This can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n2. **Hepatotoxicity**: Some antiretroviral medications, including zidovudine, can cause liver damage. This can manifest as elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, or abdominal pain.\n\n3. **Lactic Acidosis**: Zidovudine is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, a serious metabolic complication characterized by an accumulation of lactic acid in the blood. Symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, and rapid breathing.\n\n4. **Bone Marrow Suppression**: Zidovudine can also lead to bone marrow suppression, resulting in anemia, neutropenia (low neutrophil counts), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), which can increase the risk of infections and bleeding.\n\n5. **Nausea and Gastrointestinal Upset**: Many antiretroviral medications can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n6. **Hyperlipidemia**: Some antiretroviral drugs can lead to elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n7. **Peripheral Neuropathy**: Lamivudine can cause peripheral neuropathy, which may manifest as numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.\n\nIt is important for the patient to be monitored closely for these potential adverse effects, and any new symptoms should be reported promptly to the healthcare provider. Regular blood tests to monitor liver function, blood counts, and lipid levels are also essential during treatment.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 52-year-old man with HIV, given his symptoms and findings, is ** Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**. \n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning behind this diagnosis:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy. These symptoms are consistent with central nervous system involvement, which is common in PML.\n\n2. **HIV Status and Immunosuppression**: The patient has a long history of HIV and has been on antiretroviral therapy. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low (90/\u03bcL), indicating significant immunosuppression. PML is primarily seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV.\n\n3. **MRI Findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, which is a characteristic finding in PML. While ring-enhancing lesions can also be seen in other conditions (like glioblastoma), the location and nature of the lesion in the context of his immunosuppression strongly suggest PML.\n\n4. **CSF Analysis**: The slight pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA do not directly indicate PML, but they do suggest an active infection. However, the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion and the patient's immunocompromised state are more indicative of PML than a primary brain tumor like glioblastoma.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: While glioblastoma can present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, it typically does not show the same ring-enhancing pattern as PML and is less likely in an immunocompromised patient with a low CD4 count.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the patient's clinical symptoms, immunosuppressed state, MRI findings, and laboratory results strongly support a diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).",

    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, which include fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough, along with the physical examination findings of crackles in the right lower lung base and a chest X-ray showing a right lower-lobe infiltrate, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial pneumonia. \n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV and his current CD4 count of 520/mm\u00b3, which is considered relatively normal, he is at a higher risk for opportunistic infections. However, the most common bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. \n\nSince there was a recent case of a patient with similar symptoms caused by Staphylococcus aureus, it is reasonable to consider this organism as a potential cause, especially in a patient with a compromised immune system. However, without specific cultures or additional diagnostic tests, it is not possible to definitively identify the causal organism at this stage. \n\nFurther diagnostic testing, such as sputum culture, blood cultures, and possibly a CT scan of the chest, would be necessary to confirm the specific pathogen responsible for the pneumonia.",

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500). Most frequently, doctors find hematuria as a sequela of this condition. What is the most likely diagnosis and sequela of the condition?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 43-year-old man with HIV presenting with fever, night sweats, headaches, generalized weakness, and a holosystolic murmur is infective endocarditis, particularly given his history of intravenous drug use. The presence of track marks on the forearms suggests recent drug use, which is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis.\n\nThe sequela of infective endocarditis that is most frequently found is hematuria, which can occur due to renal complications associated with the infection, such as glomerulonephritis or embolic phenomena affecting the kidneys.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient is at high risk of developing septic pulmonary embolism as a sequela."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a respiratory infection, specifically pneumonia. The patient's history of coughing up malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and the presence of crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base on physical examination are indicative of a lower respiratory tract infection. The chest X-ray showing a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field further supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV infection with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (280/mm3), he is immunocompromised, which increases his risk for opportunistic infections, including pneumonia. Additionally, his lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption can further compromise his respiratory health and immune function.\n\nWhile pharyngoesophageal diverticulum can present with symptoms like cough and difficulty swallowing, it is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's acute symptoms, especially in the context of his current clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Therefore, pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and HIV coinfection, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue the current antitubercular regimen while closely monitoring the patient's response to treatment and assessing for any potential drug interactions or adverse effects.\n\n1. **Continue Current Antitubercular Regimen**: The patient is currently on a 4-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) and has shown improvement, becoming sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks. This regimen should be continued, as it is effective against TB.\n\n2. **Monitor for Drug Interactions**: The addition of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine is appropriate given the patient's low CD4 count and high HIV viral load. However, it is essential to monitor for potential drug interactions between the antitubercular drugs and the ART. Rifampin is a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes and can reduce the effectiveness of some antiretrovirals. In this case, dolutegravir is generally considered safe with rifampin, but close monitoring of HIV viral load and CD4 counts is necessary.\n\n3. **Evaluate for Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)**: The patient's symptoms of fever and increased cough, along with the presence of pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, raise concern for IRIS. This condition can occur in HIV-positive patients starting ART, especially those with low CD4 counts. If IRIS is suspected, it may require supportive treatment and possibly a temporary reduction in ART.\n\n4. **Assess for Drug Resistance**: Given the patient's clinical deterioration, it is important to consider the possibility of drug-resistant TB. If the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is no improvement, further testing for drug resistance (e.g., drug susceptibility testing) should be considered.\n\n5. **Clinical Monitoring**: The patient should be closely monitored for clinical improvement or deterioration, and any adverse effects from the medications should be assessed. Regular follow-up with chest radiographs, sputum cultures, and HIV viral load testing is essential.\n\nIn summary, the initial step is to continue the current antitubercular regimen while closely monitoring the patient's response to treatment, evaluating for potential IRIS, and considering further testing for drug resistance if necessary.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "The most likely etiology of the patient's condition, given the history of poorly controlled HIV and the presence of proteinuria, is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a specific type of kidney disease that can occur in patients with HIV, particularly those with poorly controlled infection. It is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and can lead to progressive kidney damage. The presence of morbid obesity and pitting edema further supports the diagnosis of a nephrotic syndrome, which is commonly associated with HIVAN. While membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) can also cause proteinuria and edema, the strong association with HIV in this patient makes HIVAN the more likely diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's clinical presentation, including shortness of breath, a holodiastolic murmur, and the presence of a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray, the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis would be a blood culture. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible infection, and blood cultures are essential for identifying the specific pathogen causing the infection, which could be related to his HIV status and immunocompromised state. \n\nWhile the Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is used to detect Group A Streptococcus infections, it is not the most reliable test for confirming the diagnosis in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more indicative of a broader range of potential infections, including bacterial endocarditis or other opportunistic infections common in HIV patients. Therefore, blood cultures would be the most appropriate initial step in confirming the diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is **tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)**, which is a metabolic complication that can occur in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, especially those with bulky disease, after starting chemotherapy. TLS results from the rapid breakdown of tumor cells, leading to the release of large amounts of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. This can cause hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, along with renal impairment due to the accumulation of uric acid and potassium.\n\nTo reverse the metabolic abnormalities associated with TLS, the following therapeutic interventions are typically employed:\n\n1. **Allopurinol**: This medication is used to inhibit xanthine oxidase, which helps reduce the production of uric acid. The dosage can be adjusted based on the patient's renal function and the severity of hyperuricemia.\n\n2. **Hydration**: Aggressive hydration is crucial to maintain urine output and prevent the precipitation of uric acid in the kidneys. Intravenous fluids are often used to ensure adequate hydration.\n\n3. **Monitoring of electrolytes**: Close monitoring of potassium levels is essential, as hyperkalemia can be life-threatening. If potassium levels are significantly elevated, interventions such as insulin and glucose administration or the use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) may be necessary.\n\n4. **Dialysis**: In severe cases where renal function is compromised and metabolic abnormalities persist despite medical management, dialysis may be required to remove excess uric acid and potassium.\n\n5. **Supportive care**: This includes managing any concurrent infections, providing nutritional support, and addressing any other complications that may arise.\n\nIn summary, the patient's metabolic abnormalities are likely due to tumor lysis syndrome, and the therapy to reverse these abnormalities includes the use of allopurinol, hydration, electrolyte management, and possibly dialysis if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
