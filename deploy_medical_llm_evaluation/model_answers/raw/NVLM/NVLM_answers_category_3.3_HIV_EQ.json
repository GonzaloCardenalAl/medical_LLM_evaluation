    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's current condition is most likely due to a combination of factors related to her HIV infection and her non-adherence to her antiretroviral therapy (ART). Given her low CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L, she is at a high risk for opportunistic infections and complications associated with advanced HIV disease.\n\nThe MRI findings of numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect, along with the brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes, suggest a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare but serious complication of HIV that occurs when the JC virus, a common human polyomavirus, reactivates in individuals with severely compromised immune systems, leading to demyelination of brain tissue.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including disorientation, confusion, motor weakness, uncoordinated gait, and diplopia, are consistent with the neurological deficits seen in PML. Her decision to skip doses of her antiretroviral medications likely contributed to her declining immune function, making her more susceptible to this opportunistic infection.\n\nIn summary, the most likely cause of the patient's current condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) secondary to her advanced HIV disease and non-adherence to her antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient, a 35-year-old man with a positive HIV test, is being treated with a combination of antiretroviral medications: lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir. Each of these drugs has specific adverse effects that the patient may be at risk for:\n\n1. **Lamivudine**: Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and headache. Less commonly, it can lead to liver problems, especially in patients with pre-existing liver conditions.\n\n2. **Zidovudine**: This medication can cause a range of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. More serious side effects can include bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia), and lactic acidosis, which is a rare but serious metabolic complication.\n\n3. **Indinavir**: This protease inhibitor can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also lead to kidney stones and crystalluria (crystals in the urine), which can cause pain and urinary tract issues. Additionally, indinavir can interact with other medications and has been associated with lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution) and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol).\n\nGiven the combination of these medications, the patient is at greatest risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), bone marrow suppression (from zidovudine), and potential kidney-related issues (from indinavir). Close monitoring of his blood counts, liver function, and renal function will be important during the course of treatment.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 52-year-old man with HIV, given his symptoms and findings, is ** Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, which are common symptoms of PML. The neurological examination showing ataxia and apathy further supports this diagnosis.\n\n2. **HIV and Immunosuppression**: The patient has a long history of HIV and has been on antiretroviral therapy. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL, indicating significant immunosuppression, which is a risk factor for developing PML.\n\n3. **MRI Findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, which is characteristic of PML. The size and location of the lesion are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n4. **CSF Analysis**: The slight pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA suggest an active infection, which can be associated with PML, although the presence of EBV does not confirm PML.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**: While other conditions such as primary central nervous system lymphoma or toxoplasmosis could also present with similar findings, the combination of the patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, and the specific MRI findings strongly point towards PML.\n\nIn summary, the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings collectively support a diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy.",

He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500). What is the most likely diagnosis and sequela of the condition?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 43-year-old man with HIV presenting with fever, night sweats, headaches, and generalized weakness is disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, also known as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex. This condition is particularly concerning in patients with HIV, especially those with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count below 500/mm\u00b3, as it indicates a compromised immune system.\n\n### Rationale for Diagnosis:\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient's symptoms of fever, night sweats, and generalized weakness are classic signs of disseminated infection, which is common in immunocompromised individuals.\n2. **HIV Status**: The patient's HIV status and low CD4 count (450/mm\u00b3) suggest a higher risk for opportunistic infections, including MAC.\n3. **Risk Factors**: The patient's history of intravenous drug use further increases the risk of acquiring infections, including bacterial and fungal pathogens.\n4. **Physical Examination**: The presence of a holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration may indicate underlying cardiac involvement, which can be associated with disseminated infections.\n\n### Sequela of the Condition:\nIf left untreated, disseminated MAC can lead to severe complications, including:\n- **Progressive Weight Loss**: Patients may experience significant weight loss and wasting.\n- **Malabsorption and Nutritional Deficiencies**: The infection can affect gastrointestinal function, leading to malabsorption of nutrients.\n- **Systemic Illness**: The infection can spread to various organs, leading to a decline in overall health and increased susceptibility to other opportunistic infections.\n- **Cardiac Complications**: The murmur heard during the examination could indicate endocarditis or other cardiac involvement, which can lead to serious complications if not addressed promptly.\n- **Morbidity and Mortality**: Without appropriate treatment, disseminated MAC can lead to life-threatening complications and significantly increase the risk of mortality in HIV patients.\n\n### Management:\n- **Antimicrobial Therapy**: Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, azithromycin, and rifabutin, tailored to the specific isolate if available.\n- **Supportive Care**: Addressing nutritional needs, managing symptoms, and monitoring for complications are essential.\n- **HIV Management**: Ensuring that the patient's antiretroviral therapy is optimized to improve CD4 counts and overall immune function is crucial.\n\nIn summary, the patient's clinical presentation, risk factors, and laboratory findings strongly suggest disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection, which requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment to prevent serious complications.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient is at high risk of developing septic pulmonary embolism as a sequela."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased around the mouth and along the fingers. Laboratory studies show:\n\nSerum:\nAlbumin 2.5 g/dL\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nHIV antibody positive\n\nUrine:\nBlood negative\nProtein +4\nRBC 1-2/hpf\nRBC casts negative\n\n What are the most likely findings of a kidney biopsy under light microscopy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and history, the most likely findings of a kidney biopsy under light microscopy would be consistent with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is characterized by specific histopathological changes in the kidneys, which include:\n\n1. **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)**: This is a common finding in HIVAN, where there is scarring (sclerosis) of some parts of the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidneys).\n\n2. **Glomerular Enlargement**: The glomeruli may appear larger than normal due to the accumulation of extracellular matrix and protein.\n\n3. **Hyaline Droplets**: These are protein deposits that can be seen in the tubules, often associated with proteinuria.\n\n4. **Interstitial Fibrosis**: There may be evidence of fibrosis in the interstitial spaces of the kidney, indicating damage to the kidney tissue.\n\n5. **Tubular Atrophy**: Some areas of the kidney may show atrophy of the tubular cells, which can lead to impaired kidney function.\n\n6. **Vascular Changes**: There may be evidence of vascular changes, including hyaline arteriosclerosis or other signs of vascular damage.\n\nThese findings would support the diagnosis of HIVAN, which is a known complication of HIV infection, particularly in patients with advanced disease or those who have been on antiretroviral therapy for a significant period. The presence of proteinuria (as indicated by the +4 protein in the urine) and the patient's symptoms of edema and weight gain further support this diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "Segmental sclerosis is the most likely finding."

Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, including cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and the findings on physical examination and chest X-ray, is a bacterial lung infection, such as pneumonia. Given the patient's history of HIV infection with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (280/mm\u00b3), he is immunocompromised, which increases his risk for opportunistic infections. The presence of crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base, along with the hazy infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray, further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and alcohol use can contribute to respiratory issues and weaken his immune system, making him more susceptible to infections.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation, including her HIV status, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the characteristics of her skin lesions, strongly suggests a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The presence of vascular proliferation in the skin biopsy and the low CD4 count are indicative of KS, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals with advanced immunodeficiency.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in this context would be a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage her HIV and improve her immune function, along with specific treatment for KS. The first-line treatment for KS in HIV patients is often a combination of ART and a KS-specific therapy such as liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel.\n\n1. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Initiate or optimize ART to achieve viral suppression and improve CD4 counts. Common regimens include integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) like dolutegravir, combined with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like tenofovir and emtricitabine.\n\n2. **Treatment for Kaposi's Sarcoma**: \n   - **Liposomal Doxorubicin**: This is often used for KS in HIV patients due to its efficacy and manageable side effect profile.\n   - **Paclitaxel**: Another option for treating KS, particularly if the lesions are extensive or causing significant symptoms.\n\n3. **Supportive Care**: Address her nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain with appropriate supportive measures, including antiemetics and pain management.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of her CD4 count and viral load is essential to assess the effectiveness of the ART and to manage her overall health.\n\n5. **Referral to Specialty Care**: Given her complex medical history and current condition, referral to an infectious disease specialist or an oncologist with experience in treating HIV-related malignancies is advisable.\n\nIn summary, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient includes initiating or optimizing ART and starting treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma with agents like liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel, along with supportive care measures.",

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate initial step in treatment for this patient, who has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and is HIV positive, is to evaluate the possibility of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Given the recent initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the clinical deterioration with fever, increased cough, and new pulmonary findings, IRIS should be considered as a potential cause of the symptoms.\n\n1. **Assess for IRIS**: The patient's clinical worsening after starting ART, along with the increase in CD4+ T cell count and the presence of new pulmonary infiltrates, suggests a possible immune response against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IRIS can occur when the immune system begins to recover after the initiation of ART, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response against opportunistic infections.\n\n2. **Continue Antitubercular Treatment**: The patient should continue his antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol) as it is crucial for managing the TB. The removal of pyrazinamide was likely due to its potential hepatotoxicity, but the remaining drugs should be maintained.\n\n3. **Monitor Closely**: The patient should be monitored closely for any further changes in symptoms, and serial CD4+ T cell counts and HIV RNA levels should be obtained to assess the response to treatment.\n\n4. **Consider Steroids**: If IRIS is confirmed, corticosteroids may be considered to help manage the inflammatory response, but this should be done in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.\n\n5. **Evaluate for Other Causes**: While IRIS is a strong consideration, other causes of the symptoms, such as a new opportunistic infection or drug-related adverse effects, should also be evaluated.\n\nIn summary, the initial step should be to assess for IRIS and continue the antitubercular treatment while closely monitoring the patient's condition.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and difficulty climbing stairs, along with the physical findings of morbid obesity and pitting edema in the lower extremities, along with 2+ proteinuria on urinalysis, suggest a likely etiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). \n\nGiven the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, which can lead to HIV-associated nephropathy, and the presence of proteinuria, it is plausible that HIV is contributing to his renal impairment. Additionally, his obesity may further exacerbate the risk of developing CKD. \n\nOther potential contributing factors could include hypertension (though his blood pressure is currently within normal limits), diabetes (which is common in obese individuals), or other comorbidities related to his past substance use. \n\nFurther evaluation, including renal function tests (e.g., serum creatinine, eGFR), HIV viral load, and a comprehensive assessment of his overall health, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.",

There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is ** cryptococcal meningitis**. The combination of HIV infection, neurological symptoms (such as loss of balance and pupillary abnormalities), and the presence of a holodiastolic murmur suggests a serious underlying condition. The neurological findings, including the pupillary response and ataxia, are indicative of central nervous system involvement, which is common in cryptococcal meningitis, especially in immunocompromised patients like those with HIV.\n\nTo reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities and manage cryptococcal meningitis, the following therapeutic approaches should be considered:\n\n1. **Antifungal Therapy**: The primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is antifungal medication. The initial treatment typically includes:\n   - **Amphotericin B**: This is often used in combination with flucytosine for the first few weeks of therapy.\n   - **Flucytosine**: This can be used in conjunction with amphotericin B to enhance efficacy.\n\n2. **Corticosteroids**: In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation in the brain, especially if there is significant edema or increased intracranial pressure.\n\n3. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: It is crucial to optimize the patient's antiretroviral therapy to improve his immune status. Ensuring adherence to the prescribed regimen is vital.\n\n4. **Supportive Care**: This includes managing any metabolic abnormalities, such as electrolyte imbalances, and providing supportive care for neurological symptoms.\n\n5. **Monitoring**: Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, intracranial pressure, and response to treatment is essential.\n\n6. **Neurological Consultation**: Given the neurological findings, consultation with a neurologist may be beneficial for further evaluation and management.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, and the treatment should focus on antifungal therapy, optimizing antiretroviral therapy, and providing supportive care to address the metabolic abnormalities and neurological symptoms.",
