    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "I need to point out that this question cannot be answered accurately for 1990. In 1990, there were very limited antiretroviral treatment options available globally, including in Switzerland. At that time, AZT (zidovudine) was essentially the only approved antiretroviral drug, having been approved in 1987. Other antiretrovirals like ddI (didanosine) and ddC (zalcitabine) were just beginning clinical trials and weren't widely available until later. The era of combination antiretroviral therapy didn't begin until the mid-1990s, particularly after the introduction of protease inhibitors in 1995-1996.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot provide specific information about antiretroviral drug prescription frequencies in Switzerland for 2010, as I don't have access to reliable Swiss prescription data from that year. Making claims about such specific statistics without verified data would be inappropriate. You may want to consult Swiss HIV Cohort Study publications or contact the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health for accurate historical prescription data.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "I cannot make a specific claim about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for 2010, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific comparison and year. Making such a comparison would require detailed epidemiological studies from Swiss health registries, which I cannot confidently reference.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "I cannot make a definitive statement about the specific birth rate difference between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for 2020, as I don't have access to reliable statistics for this specific comparison and year. Making claims about such specific demographic data without verified sources would be inappropriate.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

  {
    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In Switzerland, the most common mode of HIV transmission is through sexual contact, with men who have sex with men (MSM) representing the largest group of new HIV infections, followed by heterosexual transmission. This pattern has been consistent in recent years according to Swiss Federal Office of Public Health surveillance data.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "Based on Swiss HIV Cohort Study data, approximately 20-30% of visits involve patients self-reporting at least one missed dose of antiretroviral therapy per month. However, I should note that self-reported adherence data tends to underestimate actual non-adherence, as patients often over-report their medication compliance.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "Based on the Swiss HIV Cohort Study data from 2020, approximately 20% of people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland reported feeling guilty about their HIV status. However, I recommend double-checking this specific figure as I am not entirely certain about the exact percentage from that particular year.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "I cannot provide a specific percentage for Switzerland in 2020 regarding PWH (People with HIV) who feel treated like outcasts, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific metric in Switzerland for that year. Making claims about such statistics without verified data would be inappropriate. If you need this information, I'd recommend consulting Swiss HIV Cohort Study reports or contacting Swiss HIV/AIDS organizations directly.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "I cannot provide the specific proportion of people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland who died from HIV-related causes and had their first positive HIV test before age 20, as I don't have access to this precise statistic. Making claims about such specific demographic data without a verified source would be inappropriate. If you need this information, I'd recommend consulting the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) or Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) for accurate statistics.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."
  },
  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "I cannot make a specific claim about this scenario in Switzerland during that exact time period and with those specific parameters, as I don't have access to or knowledge of a study that specifically examined this question. \n\nMaking statements about CD4 decline rates comparing these specific age groups in Switzerland with these exact criteria would require access to Swiss HIV cohort data from that period and a proper statistical analysis.\n\nIf you need this information, I'd recommend consulting Swiss HIV cohort studies or reaching out to Swiss HIV research centers directly.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
