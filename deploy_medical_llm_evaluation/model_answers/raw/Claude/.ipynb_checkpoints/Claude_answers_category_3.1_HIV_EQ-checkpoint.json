    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "This patient most likely has Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus reactivation.\n\nThe key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n1. Low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L) due to medication non-compliance\n2. Neurological symptoms (confusion, disorientation, motor weakness)\n3. MRI showing asymmetric, non-enhancing white matter lesions\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Progressive course\n\nPML is an opportunistic infection seen in severely immunocompromised HIV patients (typically CD4 <100). The patient's poor medication adherence led to immunosuppression, allowing JC virus reactivation. Without treatment, PML has a poor prognosis. The key intervention would be to restart and optimize antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP), likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or other common bacterial pathogens.\n\nKey supporting factors:\n1. Clinical presentation: fever, productive cough with malodorous sputum, night sweats\n2. Physical exam findings: crackles and dullness at right lung base\n3. Chest x-ray showing right lower lobe infiltrate\n4. Immunocompromised status (CD4 count 280/mm3)\n5. Multiple risk factors:\n   - Untreated HIV\n   - Smoking history\n   - Alcohol use\n   - Homelessness\n   - Untreated diabetes\n\nWhile opportunistic infections should be considered in HIV patients, this presentation is most consistent with bacterial pneumonia, which is actually more common in HIV patients than in the general population, especially when CD4 counts are >200/mm3.\n\nTreatment should include empiric antibiotics appropriate for CABP while also addressing the patient's underlying HIV infection and other medical conditions.",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given this presentation, the next best step would be to obtain an urgent brain MRI with and without contrast. Here's why:\n\n1. The patient presents with concerning symptoms:\n- Focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness)\n- Fever\n- Low CD4 count (<200) indicating severe immunosuppression\n- Poor medication adherence\n\n2. The differential diagnosis includes:\n- Toxoplasmosis (most common CNS opportunistic infection in AIDS)\n- Primary CNS lymphoma\n- HIV-associated stroke\n- Other space-occupying lesions\n\n3. MRI with contrast is the preferred imaging modality because:\n- It can differentiate between various CNS pathologies\n- It's more sensitive than CT for detecting early changes\n- The contrast can help identify characteristic ring-enhancing lesions of toxoplasmosis\n\nWhile obtaining imaging, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis should be strongly considered given the patient's low CD4 count and typical presentation. The patient will also need a full workup including blood cultures, CSF analysis if no contraindications on imaging, and reinitiation of appropriate antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of subjective fever, cough, and night sweats. He states that over the past 2 months he has \u201cnot felt like myself.\u201d He has lost 12 lbs over this time period. Two weeks ago, he started experiencing night sweats and cough. This morning he decided to take his temperature and reports it was \u201chigh.\u201d He has a history of HIV and admits to inconsistently taking his anti-retrovirals. A chest radiograph reveals a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe. An interferon-gamma release assay is positive, and the patient is started on appropriate antimicrobial therapy. A month later he is seen in clinic for follow-up. Lab work is obtained, as shown below:\n\nLeukocyte count: 11,000/mm\u00b3 with normal differential\nHemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL\nPlatelet count: 400,000/mm\u00b3\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV): 75 \u00b5m\u00b3\n\nBased on these results, a peripheral smear is sent and shows Pappenheimer bodies. \n\n What is the most accurate test for the patient\u2019s diagnosis?",

His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and patient history, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology. Here's why:\n\nKey supporting factors:\n1. African-American ethnicity (HIVAN is more common in this population)\n2. Poorly controlled HIV\n3. Proteinuria on dipstick\n4. Lower extremity edema\n5. Constitutional symptoms (fatigue)\n\nHIVAN is a form of kidney disease that primarily affects people with HIV, particularly those with poorly controlled disease. It's characterized by heavy proteinuria and can progress to end-stage renal disease if untreated. The condition is more prevalent in African-Americans due to genetic factors, specifically variants in the APOL1 gene.\n\nTreatment would involve:\n- Optimization of antiretroviral therapy\n- ACE inhibitors or ARBs\n- Management of complications\n- Regular monitoring of kidney function\n\nEarly recognition and treatment are essential to improve outcomes.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (holodiastolic murmur, unreactive pupils that respond to accommodation but not light (Argyll Robertson pupils), positive Romberg test, and mediastinal widening), this patient likely has tertiary/late syphilis with cardiovascular involvement (aortic insufficiency) and neurosyphilis.\n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis would be:\nCSF-VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test\n\nWhile serum RPR/VDRL tests are used for screening, CSF-VDRL is considered the gold standard for diagnosing neurosyphilis due to its high specificity (99.8%), though sensitivity is lower (30-70%). A positive CSF-VDRL result is diagnostic of neurosyphilis, while a negative result doesn't exclude it.\n\nThis patient's poor adherence to HIV treatment likely contributed to the progression of syphilis, as immunodeficiency can accelerate the course of the disease.",
