    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThe key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Positive EBV DNA in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n3. MRI showing solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion\n4. Location in corpus callosum\n5. Subacute neurological symptoms (headaches, confusion, ataxia)\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. Nearly all cases of AIDS-related PCNSL are associated with EBV infection. The MRI findings are characteristic, showing a solitary or few lesions with weak enhancement, unlike the strong ring enhancement seen in toxoplasmosis, which would be the main differential diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20, brand name Fuzeon) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit and blocking the conformational changes required for viral fusion with the cell membrane.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its need for twice-daily subcutaneous injections and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms (fever, malaise, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy, positive HIV test, and relatively high CD4 count (650/mm3), this patient is most likely in the Acute HIV Infection stage, also known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome or Primary HIV Infection.\n\nThis stage typically occurs 2-4 weeks after initial infection and presents with flu-like symptoms. The CD4 count is still relatively preserved at this stage, which is consistent with the value provided (650/mm3). This acute phase typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks, followed by clinical latency.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, night sweats, productive cough), low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the finding of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods, this patient likely has Nocardiosis.\n\nThe drug of choice for Nocardia infection is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Its mechanism of action involves:\n\n1. Trimethoprim: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\n2. Sulfamethoxazole: Competitively inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, preventing the formation of dihydrofolic acid\n\nTogether, these actions create a sequential blockade in the folate synthesis pathway, ultimately preventing bacterial DNA and RNA synthesis. This dual mechanism makes TMP-SMX particularly effective against Nocardia species.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The gp120 surface glycoprotein would be the most likely target for antibody development. Here's why:\n\n1. gp120 is part of the HIV envelope protein complex\n2. It's exposed on the viral surface, making it accessible to antibodies\n3. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors\n4. It's one of the main targets of neutralizing antibodies in natural infection\n\nThis makes gp120 a logical target for therapeutic antibody development, though HIV's high mutation rate and glycan shield pose significant challenges for this approach.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. The clinical presentation (fever, hemoptysis), radiographic finding (fibrocavitary lesion), and most importantly, the microscopic finding of septate hyphae branching at acute angles (45-degree angles) are classical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which is an important opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with advanced HIV disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The greatest risk when adding valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen is bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia and anemia). This risk is especially significant because the patient is already taking zidovudine (AZT), which is also known to cause bone marrow suppression as its main toxicity.\n\nThe combination of valganciclovir and zidovudine can have an additive myelosuppressive effect, potentially leading to:\n- Severe anemia\n- Neutropenia\n- Increased risk of infections\n- Potential need for blood transfusions or drug discontinuation\n\nClose monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) is essential when using this combination of medications.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For an infant born to an HIV-positive mother, the most appropriate diagnostic test would be HIV DNA PCR testing.\n\nThe reason for this is:\n1. Maternal HIV antibodies cross the placenta and persist in the infant for up to 18 months, making antibody tests unreliable\n2. HIV DNA PCR can directly detect the presence of viral genetic material\n3. The test should be performed at:\n   - 14-21 days of age\n   - 1-2 months of age\n   - 4-6 months of age\n\nTwo negative PCR tests (one after 1 month and another after 4 months) are typically required to confidently rule out HIV infection in an exposed infant.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step is to:\n1. Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife due to her risk of exposure\n2. Inform him that while patient confidentiality is important, state laws require reporting of HIV cases to public health authorities\n3. Explain that partner notification services through the health department can help notify the wife anonymously\n4. Cannot breach confidentiality and directly tell the wife without the patient's consent, as this would violate HIPAA\n\nThe physician should document all counseling efforts and referrals to partner notification services. If the patient continues to refuse disclosure, the physician can utilize public health authorities who have procedures in place for anonymous partner notification while maintaining the source patient's confidentiality.\n\nThe key is balancing the ethical duty to protect public health with legal requirements for patient confidentiality.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this patient has acute pancreatitis. The most likely etiology in this case is medication-induced pancreatitis, specifically from antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\nKey points supporting this conclusion:\n1. The patient is on HIV medications (though unable to recall names)\n2. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine, stavudine, and less commonly others, can cause pancreatitis\n3. The timing (6 months after HIV diagnosis and presumed ART initiation) is consistent\n4. CT shows no gallstones (ruling out gallstone pancreatitis)\n5. While the patient reports moderate alcohol use, there's no indication of heavy alcohol consumption that would typically cause alcoholic pancreatitis\n\nThe next steps would include:\n1. Reviewing her specific ART regimen\n2. Possibly modifying her HIV medication regimen\n3. Providing appropriate supportive care for acute pancreatitis\n\nThis case requires collaboration with her HIV specialist to optimize her ART regimen while managing the acute pancreatitis.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) works by inhibiting reverse transcription. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing HIV from converting its RNA into DNA. This interrupts viral replication at an early stage, reducing the maternal viral load and decreasing the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to the newborn.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

  {
    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation patterns differ between latent and active HIV-1 infection. In latent HIV infection, the viral promoter (5' LTR) tends to be hypermethylated, which contributes to viral silencing and maintenance of latency. During active infection, these regions are typically hypomethylated, allowing for viral gene expression and replication. However, the complete understanding of methylation dynamics during HIV infection is still an active area of research, and more studies are needed to fully characterize these patterns and their clinical significance.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
