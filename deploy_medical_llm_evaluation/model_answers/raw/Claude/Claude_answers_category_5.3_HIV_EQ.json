    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "This patient most likely has Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus, not HAND. Key findings supporting PML include:\n\n1. Severe immunosuppression (CD4 count 75 cells/\u00b5L) due to medication non-adherence\n2. Neurological symptoms (confusion, disorientation, motor weakness)\n3. Characteristic MRI findings (asymmetric, non-enhancing white matter lesions)\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Rapid progression of symptoms\n\nWhile HAND can present with cognitive symptoms, the MRI findings, brain biopsy results, and focal neurological deficits (diplopia, asymmetric weakness) are more consistent with PML. Resuming antiretroviral therapy is urgent to improve immune function and potentially slow disease progression.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Based on the medications mentioned (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), I should highlight the main relevant adverse effects:\n\nKey adverse effects to monitor:\n1. Zidovudine (AZT): Bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia), myopathy\n2. Indinavir: Kidney stones, hyperbilirubinemia\n3. Lamivudine (3TC): Generally well tolerated, but can cause pancreatitis\n\nGiven the question's specific mention of pancreatitis, lamivudine would be the medication of greatest concern for this particular adverse effect. Monitoring for signs of pancreatitis (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) would be important.\n\nNote: This medication regimen (AZT/3TC/indinavir) is quite dated and would not be recommended as first-line therapy today. Current guidelines recommend more modern antiretroviral combinations.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), not Glioblastoma. Here's why:\n\nKey supporting evidence:\n1. Severely immunocompromised patient (CD4 count 90/\u03bcL)\n2. EBV-positive CSF PCR\n3. Single ring-enhancing lesion on MRI\n4. History of medication non-compliance\n5. Neurological symptoms (headaches, personality changes, ataxia)\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients and is strongly associated with EBV infection. The ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum and positive EBV PCR are particularly characteristic of PCNSL, rather than glioblastoma.\n\nWhile glioblastoma can present similarly on imaging, the combination of severe immunosuppression and EBV-positive CSF makes PCNSL much more likely in this case.\n\nA brain biopsy would be needed for definitive diagnosis, but the clinical picture strongly suggests PCNSL.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter.

What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and the patient's context, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most likely causative organism, not Staphylococcus aureus. Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with typical symptoms (fever, productive cough, dyspnea) and signs (crackles, infiltrate)\n\n2. Despite having HIV, the patient:\n- Is on effective antiretroviral therapy\n- Has a good CD4 count (520/mm\u00b3)\n- Is therefore not severely immunocompromised\n\n3. In HIV patients with CD4 counts >200/mm\u00b3, the spectrum of pneumonia-causing organisms is similar to that of the general population, where S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of CAP\n\n4. While S. aureus can cause pneumonia, it's less common in community-acquired cases and is more typically associated with:\n- Post-viral infections (especially influenza)\n- Healthcare-associated pneumonia\n- IV drug use\n- More severe presentation\n\nThe fact that another patient had S. aureus pneumonia doesn't change the epidemiological likelihood that this particular case is caused by S. pneumoniae.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Mycobacterium avium. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and findings, this is most likely Bartonella henselae (or possibly B. quintana), not Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).\n\nKey points supporting Bartonella diagnosis:\n1. Characteristic bacillary angiomatosis lesions: bright red, friable nodules\n2. Biopsy showing vascular proliferation\n3. Low CD4 count (<200)\n4. Hepatic involvement (bacillary peliosis)\n5. Common in homeless populations\n\nWhile MAC can cause systemic symptoms in AIDS patients, it typically doesn't cause the characteristic skin lesions described here. MAC usually presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and disseminated infection primarily affecting the blood, bone marrow, liver, and lungs.\n\nThe skin lesions, biopsy findings, and hepatic involvement strongly point to bacillary angiomatosis caused by Bartonella species, which is a well-known opportunistic infection in advanced HIV disease.",

He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "There appears to be an error in your statement about pharyngoesophageal diverticulum being the most frequent diagnosis - this doesn't fit the clinical presentation at all.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). Here's why:\n\n1. Clinical presentation:\n- Productive cough with malodorous sputum\n- Fever and night sweats\n- Abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea)\n- Lung examination showing crackles and dullness\n- Chest x-ray showing infiltrate\n\n2. Risk factors:\n- HIV positive with CD4 count 280 (immunocompromised)\n- Smoking history\n- Alcohol use\n- Homelessness\n- Untreated medical conditions\n- Poor medication compliance\n\nThis patient needs prompt treatment for bacterial pneumonia, and his HIV status should be addressed with appropriate antiretroviral therapy. The suggestion of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is incorrect as it doesn't match the clinical presentation, examination findings, or imaging results.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation, this patient likely has toxoplasmosis encephalitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm\u00b3. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n- Low CD4 count (77 cells/mm\u00b3)\n- Focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness)\n- Fever\n- Poor medication adherence\n\nThe next best step in management would be:\n1. Urgent brain MRI with contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI is not immediately available)\n2. Start empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin\n\nNote: The mention of empiric itraconazole use at the hospital is not relevant here, as itraconazole is not the appropriate treatment for suspected CNS toxoplasmosis. Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for imaging results in this scenario.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's antiretroviral therapy adherence should be addressed, but this is a secondary concern after managing the acute condition.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For this first prenatal visit at 8 weeks gestation, the recommended tests include:\n\nEssential tests:\n1. Blood type and Rh factor\n2. Complete blood count (CBC)\n3. HIV testing\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen\n5. Syphilis screening (RPR or VDRL)\n6. Rubella immunity\n7. Urine culture and urinalysis\n8. Gonorrhea and Chlamydia screening\n\nOptional/Based on Risk Factors:\n- Hepatitis C screening\n- Tuberculosis screening\n- Genetic carrier screening based on ethnicity/family history\n\nNote: While your hospital has been testing TSH, CMV, and HSV-2, these are not universally recommended as routine first trimester screening tests. They should be ordered based on specific risk factors or symptoms. Previous negative STI results from 4 years ago do not eliminate the need for current testing, as new infections could have occurred since then.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, this patient has Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n- Low CD4 count (<100)\n- Red papules\n- Vascular proliferation and bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain\n- IV drug use (risk factor)\n\nThe most appropriate treatment is:\nErythromycin (500 mg PO QID) or Doxycycline (100 mg PO BID) for at least 3 months\n\nNote: The mention of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not relevant here as those medications are typically used for toxoplasmosis, not BA. The patient should also be started on antiretroviral therapy for their advanced HIV disease, and the oral thrush (white patches) should be treated with antifungal medication.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "These lesions are consistent with condylomata acuminata (genital warts), which are indeed caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). However, while HPV types 16 and 18 are high-risk types primarily associated with cervical, anal, and other cancers, genital warts are most commonly caused by HPV types 6 and 11 (low-risk types).\n\nThe key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n- Painless, skin-colored papilliform lesions\n- Location on penile shaft and perianal area\n- Acetowhite reaction with acetic acid application\n\nThe patient's HIV status is relevant as immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to HPV infection and may have more extensive or persistent lesions that are harder to treat.",

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient is experiencing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) associated with tuberculosis after starting antiretroviral therapy. This is evidenced by:\n1. Clinical worsening after ART initiation\n2. Increase in CD4 count and decrease in viral load\n3. New radiological findings\n4. Increased Mantoux reaction\n5. Negative sputum smear (ruling out TB treatment failure)\n\nThe most appropriate initial step is to:\n1. Continue both the current anti-TB medications and antiretroviral therapy\n2. Add corticosteroids (typically prednisone) to manage the inflammatory response\n\nChanging to a 5-drug TB regimen with streptomycin is not appropriate because:\n- This is not a case of TB treatment failure\n- The patient had initially responded well to the 4-drug regimen\n- Adding more TB drugs won't address the underlying cause (immune reconstitution)\n\nEven if this has been your hospital's practice, it would not be evidence-based management for TB-IRIS. The key is to control the inflammatory response while continuing both HIV and TB treatment.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and history, HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology, rather than Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n1. African-American patient\n2. Poorly controlled HIV\n3. History of heroin use\n4. Proteinuria\n5. Clinical symptoms of fatigue and edema suggesting kidney dysfunction\n\nHIVAN is the most common cause of kidney disease in HIV-infected patients, particularly affecting African Americans. The condition typically presents with significant proteinuria and progressive kidney dysfunction. The fact that your hospital has been attributing similar cases to MPGN for the past 10 years doesn't change the clinical presentation which is more consistent with HIVAN.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a kidney biopsy would be recommended, along with CD4 count and HIV viral load to assess HIV control.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, this patient likely has neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis (aortic insufficiency). The most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis would be:\n\n1. Serum RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) or VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) as initial screening\n2. Followed by confirmatory FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) or TP-PA (T. pallidum Particle Agglutination)\n3. If positive, CSF analysis with CSF-VDRL would be needed to confirm neurosyphilis\n\nNote: Antistreptolysin O titer (ASO) is not appropriate for diagnosing syphilis - it's used to detect recent streptococcal infections. The hospital's practice of using ASO for this clinical profile is incorrect and should be updated to current standard testing protocols for syphilis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggesting syphilis include:\n- Argyll Robertson pupils (react to accommodation but not light)\n- Positive Romberg sign\n- Aortic insufficiency with holodiastolic murmur\n- Mediastinal widening (suggesting aortic involvement)\n- History of HIV (increases risk of syphilis)",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "This patient is experiencing Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), a medical emergency that occurs when large numbers of cancer cells are killed rapidly (usually after initiating chemotherapy), releasing their cellular contents into the bloodstream. The presentation is classic with:\n- Acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine)\n- Hyperuricemia (high uric acid)\n- Hyperkalemia\n- Decreased urine output\n\nWhile Allopurinol is commonly used to prevent TLS, it only prevents new uric acid formation. For established TLS with severe metabolic derangements as in this case, Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) is the treatment of choice because it:\n- Rapidly breaks down existing uric acid\n- Works much faster than allopurinol\n- Is more effective in established cases\n\nAdditional management should include:\n- Aggressive IV hydration\n- Cardiac monitoring\n- Treatment of hyperkalemia\n- Consider hemodialysis if severe or refractory",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
