    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and brain biopsy results, this patient most likely has Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus reactivation, not HAND.\n\nKey points supporting PML:\n1. Severe immunosuppression (CD4 count 75 cells/\u00b5L) due to medication non-adherence\n2. Neurological symptoms: confusion, disorientation, motor weakness, diplopia\n3. Characteristic MRI findings: asymmetric, non-enhancing white matter lesions\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Subacute progression of symptoms\n\nWhile HAND can present with cognitive symptoms, the MRI findings, brain biopsy results, and focal neurological deficits are more consistent with PML. This condition requires urgent attention and reinstitution of effective antiretroviral therapy.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30.

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the presented information, the most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), not Glioblastoma. Here's why:\n\nKey findings supporting PCNSL:\n1. Severely immunocompromised patient (CD4 count 90/\u03bcL)\n2. Single ring-enhancing brain lesion\n3. EBV DNA positive in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n4. Neurological symptoms including personality changes, headaches, and ataxia\n5. History of poor medication adherence\n\nWhile Glioblastoma can present similarly on imaging, the combination of:\n- HIV-positive status\n- Very low CD4 count\n- EBV positive CSF\n- Ring-enhancing lesion\n\nMakes PCNSL much more likely in this case. The previous patient with similar symptoms but diagnosed with Glioblastoma likely had a different clinical context (HIV status, immune status, CSF findings).\n\nFurther diagnostic confirmation would typically involve brain biopsy, but the clinical and laboratory findings strongly support PCNSL as the diagnosis.",

He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "There appears to be an error in the diagnostic assumption. Based on the presented symptoms and findings, this patient most likely has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, not a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum.\n\nThe key findings supporting pneumonia include:\n1. Fever\n2. Productive cough with malodorous sputum\n3. Night sweats\n4. Right lower lung field infiltrate on chest x-ray\n5. Physical exam findings of crackles and dullness at right lung base\n6. Tachypnea and tachycardia\n\nContributing risk factors:\n- Untreated HIV with CD4 count of 280/mm\u00b3\n- Smoking history\n- Alcohol use\n- Homelessness\n- Untreated diabetes\n\nThe suggestion of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum does not fit the clinical presentation, as that condition typically presents with dysphagia, regurgitation, and neck mass, none of which are present here.\n\nThis patient needs prompt treatment for bacterial pneumonia, considering his immunocompromised state and multiple risk factors.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation, this patient likely has toxoplasmosis encephalitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm\u00b3. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n- Low CD4 count (77/mm\u00b3)\n- Focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness)\n- Fever\n- Poor medication adherence\n\nThe next best step in management would be:\n1. Urgent brain MRI with contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI is not immediately available)\n2. Start empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin\n\nNote: The mention of empiric itraconazole use at the hospital is not relevant here, as itraconazole is not the appropriate treatment for suspected toxoplasmosis encephalitis. Empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis should be initiated promptly in HIV patients with CD4 <100 and focal neurological findings, along with appropriate imaging studies.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For this first prenatal visit at 8 weeks, recommended tests include:\n\nEssential tests:\n1. Blood type and Rh factor\n2. Complete blood count (CBC)\n3. HIV testing\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen\n5. Syphilis screening\n6. Rubella immunity\n7. Urine culture\n8. Blood sugar\n9. Urinalysis\n\nOptional but commonly performed:\n1. Hepatitis C antibody\n2. Gonorrhea and Chlamydia testing\n3. Pap smear if due\n\nNote: While your hospital has been testing TSH, CMV, and HSV-2, these are not part of routine first trimester prenatal screening according to current guidelines. TSH screening may be considered but isn't universally recommended for all pregnant women. CMV and HSV-2 testing are not routinely recommended unless there are specific risk factors or symptoms.\n\nAdditional testing should be offered based on ethnicity, family history, or specific risk factors (such as genetic carrier screening).",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, skin lesions), risk factors (IV drug use), very low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the biopsy showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, this patient likely has Bacillary Angiomatosis caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana.\n\nThe most appropriate treatment is:\n- Erythromycin 500 mg PO four times daily\nOR\n- Doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily\n\nTreatment should be continued for at least 3 months to prevent relapse.\n\nNote: The mention of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not relevant here as those medications are typically used for toxoplasmosis, not bacillary angiomatosis.\n\nThe patient also appears to have oral candidiasis (white patches that can be scraped off) which should be treated separately with antifungal therapy.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation strongly suggests condyloma acuminata (genital warts) caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n1. Multiple painless skin-colored papilliform lesions in the anogenital region\n2. Positive acetowhite test (turning white with acetic acid application)\n3. Patient's HIV status (immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible)\n\nWhile HPV types 16 and 18 are indeed oncogenic types associated with cervical, anal, and penile cancers, genital warts are most commonly caused by HPV types 6 and 11 (approximately 90% of cases). These are considered low-risk HPV types.\n\nTherefore, while your hospital has been attributing these lesions to types 16 and 18, this is not entirely accurate. The most likely etiology in this case would be HPV types 6 and/or 11.\n\nIt's important to note that HIV-positive patients may be infected with multiple HPV types simultaneously and should be monitored closely due to increased risk of progression to dysplasia or cancer.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This patient is experiencing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) associated with tuberculosis after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is evidenced by:\n- Improvement in immune status (CD4 count increase from 90 to 370)\n- Decrease in viral load\n- New clinical symptoms (fever, cough)\n- New radiographic findings\n- Increased Mantoux reaction\n- Timeline (3 weeks after ART initiation)\n\nThe most appropriate initial step would be to:\n1. Continue both current ART and TB treatment\n2. Add corticosteroids (typically prednisone)\n\nIt would be incorrect to change to a 5-drug TB regimen despite your hospital's protocol, as this is not a TB treatment failure but rather an immune reconstitution phenomenon. Adding more TB drugs would not address the underlying mechanism of IRIS.\n\nThe patient should be monitored closely, but IRIS typically resolves with supportive care and continuation of both TB treatment and ART.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and patient history, HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology, not Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n1. African-American patient\n2. Poorly controlled HIV\n3. Proteinuria\n4. History of IV drug use\n5. Symptoms suggesting renal dysfunction (fatigue, edema)\n\nHIVAN is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients, particularly affecting African Americans. The condition typically presents with proteinuria and progressive renal failure. The reference to MPGN being attributed for 10 years appears incorrect in this context, as HIVAN would be the more typical diagnosis given this patient's risk factors and presentation.\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Optimizing HIV control with antiretroviral therapy\n2. Managing symptoms\n3. Preventing further kidney damage\n4. Consider ACE inhibitor or ARB for proteinuria",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, this patient likely has neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis (as evidenced by the Argyll Robertson pupils, positive Romberg test, aortic insufficiency murmur, and mediastinal widening suggesting aortic involvement).\n\nThe most reliable test to confirm syphilis in this case would be:\n1. Serologic testing with both:\n- Treponemal test (such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA)\n- Non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL)\n\n2. CSF analysis including:\n- CSF-VDRL\n- Cell count\n- Protein\n\nNote: Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is not appropriate for diagnosing syphilis - it's used to detect prior streptococcal infections. If your hospital has been using ASO for this purpose, this practice should be reviewed as it is not the standard of care for diagnosing syphilis.\n\nThe combination of HIV and poor medication adherence puts this patient at higher risk for neurosyphilis and more severe manifestations of syphilis.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "This patient is experiencing Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), a serious oncologic emergency that occurs when large numbers of cancer cells are killed rapidly (usually following chemotherapy), releasing their intracellular contents into the bloodstream.\n\nThe diagnosis is supported by:\n- Timing: 8 days after starting chemotherapy for bulky Burkitt's lymphoma\n- High uric acid\n- Hyperkalemia\n- Acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine)\n\nWhile Allopurinol is commonly used for TLS prophylaxis, in this acute setting with established TLS, Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) is the preferred treatment because:\n1. It rapidly converts uric acid to allantoin (more soluble)\n2. It's more effective than allopurinol for established TLS\n3. Allopurinol only prevents new uric acid formation but doesn't reduce existing levels\n\nAdditional management should include:\n- Aggressive IV hydration\n- Cardiac monitoring\n- Treatment of hyperkalemia\n- Possible dialysis if severe renal failure persists",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
