    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "I need to be honest - I cannot make specific claims about antiretroviral drug use in Switzerland in 1990 with confidence. In 1990, there were very limited options available globally, with zidovudine (AZT) being the main antiretroviral drug in use since its approval in 1987. Other drugs like didanosine (ddI) were just beginning to emerge. Without access to specific Swiss historical prescription data from that time, I cannot definitively list the five most frequently used drugs in Switzerland for that specific year.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I don't have access to specific Swiss prescription data from 2010. Making claims about the exact ranking of most frequently prescribed antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland for that specific year without verified data would be inappropriate. This kind of information would typically be available through Swiss health authorities or HIV cohort studies, but I don't want to make assumptions about the rankings without accurate historical data.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "I cannot make a specific claim about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland in 2010, as I don't have access to reliable data for that specific year and comparison. Making such a comparison would require carefully controlled epidemiological studies from that time period, which I am not confident citing without verification.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "I cannot make any specific claims about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for 2020, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific comparison and year. Making such a comparison would require official public health statistics that I'm not certain exist or have been published. It would be best to consult Swiss public health databases or contact Swiss HIV cohort researchers directly for accurate information on this topic.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In Switzerland, sexual transmission is the most common source of HIV infection, with unprotected sexual contact between men (MSM - men who have sex with men) representing the largest transmission group. This is followed by heterosexual transmission. This pattern has been consistent in recent years according to Swiss public health data.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "Based on Swiss cohort data, approximately 20-30% of patients self-report missing at least one dose of their HIV medication per month during clinical visits. However, I recommend verifying this specific number in current Swiss HIV Cohort Study publications, as adherence rates can vary over time and I want to be completely certain about the exact figure.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

  {
    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study quality of life assessment data from 2020, about one-third (33%) of people living with HIV in Switzerland reported feeling guilty about having HIV. However, I recommend double-checking this specific statistic, as I am not entirely certain about the exact figure from that particular year.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "I don't have access to specific data from Switzerland from 2020 regarding people with HIV's perceptions of being treated like outcasts. Without being able to verify this specific statistic, I cannot provide an accurate percentage. Making claims about such specific data without proper verification would be inappropriate.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."
  },
  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "I cannot provide an accurate figure for Switzerland specifically regarding what proportion of people with HIV (PWH) who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before age 20. This would require access to detailed Swiss HIV surveillance data with age-specific testing and mortality information, which I don't have. Making claims about such specific statistics without proper data would be inappropriate.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."
  },
  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "I cannot make specific claims about this very detailed scenario in Switzerland as I would need access to this specific epidemiological data to answer accurately. Without a direct reference to a study that specifically analyzed this population with these exact parameters (Switzerland, 1990-2010, initial CD4>300, age comparison above/below 20), I cannot make statements about CD4 decline patterns between these age groups. This would require analysis of Swiss HIV Cohort Study data or similar national databases with these specific variables.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
