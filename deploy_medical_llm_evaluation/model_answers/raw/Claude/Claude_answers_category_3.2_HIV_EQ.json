    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "This patient most likely has Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus infection.\n\nKey supporting findings:\n1. Low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L) due to medication non-compliance\n2. Neurological symptoms (confusion, disorientation, motor weakness)\n3. MRI showing asymmetric, non-enhancing white matter lesions\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Immunocompromised state due to HIV and poor medication adherence\n\nPML is an opportunistic infection that typically occurs in HIV patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/\u00b5L. The infection causes demyelination of white matter, leading to progressive neurological deficits. Treatment involves optimizing antiretroviral therapy to improve immune function.",

He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given this patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain an urgent brain MRI with and without contrast.\n\nKey factors supporting this decision:\n1. Focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness)\n2. Immunocompromised status (CD4 < 200)\n3. Fever\n4. Poor medication adherence\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes:\n- Toxoplasmosis (most common CNS opportunistic infection in AIDS)\n- Primary CNS lymphoma\n- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n- HIV-associated stroke\n\nAn MRI would help differentiate between these conditions and guide appropriate treatment. Given his low CD4 count and fever, an opportunistic infection (particularly toxoplasmosis) needs to be ruled out before considering other diagnoses.\n\nWhile stroke is possible given his risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia), his immunocompromised status and fever make an infectious/opportunistic process more likely.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At this first prenatal visit (8 weeks' gestation), the following essential tests should be ordered:\n\n1. Blood tests:\n- Complete blood count (CBC)\n- Blood type and Rh factor\n- HIV screening\n- Hepatitis B surface antigen\n- Syphilis screening (RPR)\n- Rubella immunity status\n- TSH level\n\n2. Urine tests:\n- Urinalysis\n- Urine culture\n- Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening\n\n3. Optional/Risk-based testing:\n- Hepatitis C screening if risk factors present\n- Early diabetes screening if risk factors present\n- Genetic carrier screening based on ethnicity/family history\n\nPrevious negative STI testing from 4 years ago does not eliminate the need for current screening, as new infections could have occurred in the intervening period.\n\nThe goal is to identify any conditions that could affect maternal or fetal health and require management during pregnancy.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, skin lesions), risk factors (IV drug use), low CD4 count (<100), and biopsy findings (vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain), this patient most likely has Bacillary Angiomatosis caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy is:\n- Erythromycin 500 mg orally 4 times daily for at least 3 months\n\nAlternative treatment options include:\n- Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily\n- Azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily\n\nTreatment should be continued for at least 3 months due to the immunocompromised state of the patient. The patient also has oral candidiasis (white patches) which should be treated, and she should be started on antiretroviral therapy after stabilization.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "These lesions are most likely caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), specifically presenting as condyloma acuminata (genital warts). The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n1. Painless, skin-colored papilliform lesions in the anogenital region\n2. Positive acetowhite test (turning white with acetic acid application)\n3. Patient risk factors: HIV-positive status and multiple sexual partners\n\nHIV-positive individuals are at higher risk for HPV infection and tend to have more persistent and extensive lesions due to their compromised immune system. They also have a higher risk of progression to dysplasia and cancer, particularly for high-risk HPV types.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient is likely experiencing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) associated with tuberculosis after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is suggested by:\n\n1. Worsening symptoms after ART initiation\n2. Improved CD4 count (90 to 370/\u03bcL)\n3. Decreased viral load\n4. New lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates\n5. Increased Mantoux test response\n6. Negative sputum smear (ruling out TB treatment failure)\n\nThe most appropriate initial step is to:\nContinue both antitubercular therapy and ART while adding corticosteroids (typically prednisone) to manage the inflammatory response.\n\nIRIS is a paradoxical worsening of symptoms due to improved immune function rather than worsening infection. Discontinuing either TB treatment or ART would be inappropriate as both are essential for the patient's recovery.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and patient history, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology. Here's why:\n\nKey supporting factors:\n1. African-American ethnicity (HIVAN is more common in this population)\n2. Poorly controlled HIV\n3. Proteinuria\n4. Lower extremity edema\n5. Constitutional symptoms (fatigue)\n\nHIVAN is a form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that occurs in HIV patients, particularly those with poor viral control. It's more prevalent in African-Americans and can present with nephrotic syndrome features like proteinuria and edema. Early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy is crucial to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease.\n\nWhile other conditions like diabetic nephropathy or heroin-associated nephropathy could be considered, HIVAN is most likely given the clinical context.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation, this patient likely has neurosyphilis with cardiovascular involvement (aortic insufficiency), which is more common in HIV-positive patients, especially those with poor medication adherence.\n\nKey findings supporting this diagnosis:\n- Argyll Robertson pupils (don't react to light but constrict with accommodation)\n- Positive Romberg sign (balance loss with eyes closed)\n- Holodiastolic murmur (suggesting aortic insufficiency)\n- Mediastinal widening on chest x-ray (suggesting aortic involvement)\n- HIV positive with poor medication compliance\n- Fever\n\nTreatment:\nThe recommended therapy is:\n- IV Penicillin G 18-24 million units per day (given as 3-4 million units IV every 4 hours) for 10-14 days\n\nThis is not primarily a metabolic condition, but rather an infectious disease requiring antimicrobial therapy. The patient will also need optimization of his HIV therapy and improved medication adherence.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "This patient is experiencing Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), a potentially life-threatening complication of cancer treatment. The diagnosis is supported by:\n\n1. Timing: Occurs within days of starting chemotherapy for a highly proliferative malignancy (Burkitt's lymphoma)\n2. Laboratory findings showing:\n- Hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid)\n- Hyperkalemia (high potassium)\n- Acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine and BUN)\n\nTLS occurs when rapid destruction of cancer cells releases their intracellular contents into the bloodstream, overwhelming the body's excretory mechanisms. Burkitt's lymphoma is particularly high-risk for TLS due to its rapid growth rate and sensitivity to chemotherapy.\n\nThis is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment with:\n- IV fluids\n- Allopurinol or rasburicase\n- Management of electrolyte abnormalities\n- Possible dialysis given the severe renal dysfunction",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
