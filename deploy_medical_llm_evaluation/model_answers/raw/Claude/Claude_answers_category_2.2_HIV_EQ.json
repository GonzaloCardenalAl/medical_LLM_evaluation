    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL). This diagnosis is supported by:\n\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Positive EBV DNA in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n3. MRI findings showing a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum\n4. Clinical symptoms (headaches, confusion, neurological deficits)\n\nPCNSL in HIV patients is strongly associated with EBV infection and typically occurs in severely immunocompromised individuals with CD4 counts below 100 cells/\u03bcL.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20, brand name Fuzeon) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thereby blocking the conformational changes required for viral fusion with the cell membrane. However, it's important to note that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its requirement for twice-daily subcutaneous injection and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with limited options.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Given the symptoms (fever, malaise, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy, positive HIV test, and relatively high CD4 count (650/mm3), this patient is most likely in the Acute HIV Infection stage, also known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome or Primary HIV Infection.\n\nThis stage typically occurs 2-4 weeks after initial infection and presents with flu-like symptoms. The CD4 count is usually still relatively preserved at this stage, as seen in this patient, before the dramatic decline that occurs in later stages.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, night sweats, productive cough), low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the finding of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods in BAL, this patient likely has Nocardiosis.\n\nThe first-line treatment for Nocardia infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\nMechanism of action of TMP-SMX:\n- Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\n- Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase\n- Together, they create a sequential blockade of the bacterial folate synthesis pathway\n- This ultimately prevents bacterial production of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is essential for DNA/RNA synthesis\n- The dual blockade creates a synergistic antibacterial effect\n\nThis medication is particularly effective against Nocardia and is considered first-line therapy, especially in immunocompromised patients like the one presented in this case.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The gp120 surface glycoprotein would be the most likely target for antibody development. Here's why:\n\n1. gp120 is part of the HIV envelope protein complex\n2. It's exposed on the virus surface, making it accessible to antibodies\n3. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors\n4. It's one of the main targets of neutralizing antibodies in natural infection\n\nWhile gp41 is also an important envelope protein, gp120 is generally considered a better target for neutralizing antibody development due to its accessibility and critical role in viral entry.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. The description of septate hyphae branching at acute angles (45-degree angles) on microscopy is classic for Aspergillus species. In HIV-positive patients, especially those with low CD4 counts, invasive aspergillosis can occur and commonly presents with pulmonary involvement, including cavitary lesions, along with symptoms like fever and hemoptysis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The greatest risk when adding valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen is bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia and anemia), because both valganciclovir and zidovudine (AZT) can cause bone marrow suppression. This is a significant drug-drug interaction that requires close monitoring.\n\nZidovudine is known to cause bone marrow suppression as one of its main side effects, and when combined with valganciclovir, which also has myelosuppressive properties, there is an additive risk for:\n- Anemia\n- Neutropenia\n- Thrombocytopenia\n\nRegular monitoring of complete blood counts would be necessary, and dose adjustments might be required if significant cytopenias develop.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn born to an HIV-positive mother, the most appropriate initial diagnostic test would be an HIV DNA PCR test, which should be performed at 14-21 days of life, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age.\n\nThe reason we use HIV DNA PCR rather than HIV antibody testing is because maternal HIV antibodies cross the placenta and can persist in the infant for up to 18 months. This makes antibody testing unreliable for diagnosing HIV infection in infants born to HIV-positive mothers.\n\nPCR testing directly detects the presence of viral genetic material, making it the gold standard for early infant diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step is to:\n\n1. Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife due to her risk of exposure\n\n2. Inform him that while patient confidentiality is important, many states have partner notification laws requiring that individuals who may have been exposed to HIV be informed\n\n3. Refer him to the local health department for partner notification services, which can notify the wife anonymously without revealing the source of exposure\n\nThe physician cannot directly disclose the HIV status to the wife without the patient's permission, as this would violate HIPAA and patient confidentiality laws. However, the physician should make it clear that the wife needs to be informed through appropriate channels and tested, given her potential exposure risk. The health department can assist with anonymous partner notification while maintaining the patient's confidentiality.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and history, the most likely etiology of this patient's acute pancreatitis is medication-related, specifically due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here's why:\n\n1. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and less commonly lamivudine (3TC), have been associated with pancreatitis.\n\n2. The patient has relatively recent HIV diagnosis (6 months) and is on ART (though unable to recall specific medications).\n\n3. Other common causes seem less likely:\n- No gallstones visible on CT\n- BMI is normal (21 kg/m2), making metabolic causes less likely\n- Only moderate alcohol use reported, making alcoholic pancreatitis less likely\n- No history of prior episodes or trauma\n\nThe diagnosis should be confirmed by:\n1. Reviewing the specific ART regimen\n2. Excluding other causes (triglycerides, calcium levels)\n3. Considering temporary discontinuation of suspected medications in consultation with HIV specialist\n\nA consultation with her HIV specialist would be appropriate to possibly modify her ART regimen if medication-induced pancreatitis is confirmed.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) primarily works by inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase. Specifically, it is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing the conversion of viral RNA to DNA during HIV replication. By blocking this crucial step in viral replication, it reduces viral load and decreases the risk of mother-to-child transmission during labor and delivery.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation patterns differ between latent and active HIV-1 infection. In latent infection, the HIV-1 promoter region typically shows increased methylation, which contributes to viral silencing and maintenance of latency. During active infection, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, allowing for viral gene expression and replication.\n\nHowever, I should note that many details about genome-wide methylation changes during different stages of HIV infection are still being researched, and our understanding continues to evolve. The complete picture of how methylation patterns influence HIV latency and reactivation is not fully understood.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
