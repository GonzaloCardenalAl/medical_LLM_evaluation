    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThe key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Positive EBV PCR in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n3. MRI showing solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion in corpus callosum\n4. Constitutional symptoms like headache and confusion\n5. The corpus callosum is a characteristic location for PCNSL\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. It is strongly associated with EBV infection, and brain biopsy (if needed) would typically show diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20, brand name Fuzeon) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thereby blocking the conformational change required for viral fusion with the cell membrane. However, it's important to note that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its need for twice-daily subcutaneous injection and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms (fever, malaise, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy, positive HIV test, and relatively high CD4 count (650/mm3), this patient is most likely in the Acute HIV Infection stage, also known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome or Primary HIV Infection.\n\nThis stage typically occurs 2-4 weeks after initial infection and presents with flu-like symptoms. The CD4 count is still relatively preserved at this stage, which fits with the value of 650/mm3 in this case. The symptoms typically resolve spontaneously within a few weeks, even without treatment.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, night sweats, productive cough), low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the finding of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods in BAL, this patient likely has Nocardiosis.\n\nThe first-line treatment for Nocardia infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\nMechanism of action of TMP-SMX:\n- Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\n- Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase\n- Together, they create a sequential blockade of the folate synthesis pathway\n- This blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is essential for bacterial DNA and protein synthesis\n- This creates a bactericidal effect against Nocardia species\n\nIt's worth noting that this patient also needs to restart and adhere to HAART to improve their immune function and prevent future opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target would be gp120, which is a glycoprotein on the surface of the HIV envelope. Here's why:\n\n1. gp120 is the main surface protein that mediates viral entry into CD4+ T cells\n2. It's highly exposed on the viral surface, making it accessible to antibodies\n3. It's a key target for neutralizing antibodies produced during natural infection\n4. Many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) being developed target gp120\n\nThis makes gp120 an ideal target for therapeutic antibody development compared to other viral proteins that might be less accessible or less critical for viral function.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. The clinical presentation (fever, hemoptysis), radiographic finding (fibrocavitary lesion), and especially the histopathology showing septate hyphae with acute-angle branching are classic features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which is a significant opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with advanced HIV disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The greatest risk when adding valganciclovir to this patient's regimen is severe hematologic toxicity, particularly neutropenia and anemia. This risk is especially significant because the patient is already taking zidovudine (AZT), which is also known to cause bone marrow suppression.\n\nThe key concern here is:\n- Zidovudine (AZT) commonly causes bone marrow suppression\n- Valganciclovir also has significant hematologic toxicity\n- The combination can lead to additive or synergistic bone marrow suppression\n\nThis patient will need close monitoring of their complete blood count (CBC), particularly their neutrophil and hemoglobin levels, during treatment with this combination of medications.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For an infant born to an HIV-positive mother, the most appropriate diagnostic test would be HIV DNA PCR testing. This test should be performed at:\n- 14-21 days of life\n- 1-2 months of age\n- 4-6 months of age\n\nHIV antibody testing is not appropriate for newborns because maternal antibodies cross the placenta and can persist in the infant for up to 18 months, potentially giving false-positive results. HIV DNA PCR testing directly detects the presence of viral genetic material, making it the preferred test for early infant diagnosis.\n\nIf HIV DNA PCR testing is negative at all time points and the infant has no clinical evidence of HIV disease, HIV infection can be reasonably excluded.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step is to:\n\n1. Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosure to his wife, as she needs to be tested and may require treatment.\n\n2. Explain that while patient confidentiality is important, state laws often require reporting of HIV cases to public health authorities who can assist with partner notification.\n\n3. Inform the patient that if he refuses to disclose his status to his wife, public health authorities can notify her anonymously without revealing his identity.\n\nThe physician cannot directly tell the wife due to HIPAA regulations and patient confidentiality, even though she is also a patient. However, working with public health officials provides a legal and ethical way to ensure the wife is notified and can seek testing and care while maintaining the patient's confidentiality.\n\nThe focus should be on encouraging voluntary disclosure by the patient himself, with support and counseling from healthcare providers.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "In this case, the most likely etiology is drug-induced pancreatitis, specifically related to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has recently diagnosed HIV and is on ART (though unable to recall the specific medications)\n2. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine, stavudine, and less commonly lamivudine, are known to cause pancreatitis\n3. The clinical presentation (severe epigastric pain radiating to back, nausea, vomiting) and laboratory findings (elevated amylase and lipase) are consistent with acute pancreatitis\n4. CT findings confirm pancreatitis\n5. Other common causes seem less likely:\n   - Normal gallbladder on CT (rules out gallstone pancreatitis)\n   - BMI is normal (less likely metabolic)\n   - Only moderate alcohol use reported (less likely alcoholic pancreatitis)\n\nThe next steps would include:\n- Reviewing the specific ART regimen\n- Considering modification of the regimen if necessary\n- Supportive care for acute pancreatitis",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) primarily works by inhibiting reverse transcription. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing HIV from converting its RNA genome into DNA. This disrupts viral replication early in the HIV life cycle.\n\nIn this acute situation, intravenous AZT during labor and delivery has been shown to help reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, even when the mother has not received prior antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation patterns differ between latent and active HIV-1 infection:\n\nIn latent HIV-1:\n- The HIV-1 promoter region tends to be hypermethylated\n- This methylation contributes to viral latency by suppressing viral gene expression\n- CpG islands in the 5' LTR region are typically heavily methylated\n\nIn active HIV-1:\n- The viral promoter region shows reduced methylation\n- This hypomethylation allows for active viral transcription\n- Overall decreased methylation correlates with increased viral replication\n\nHowever, it's important to note that DNA methylation is just one of several epigenetic mechanisms involved in HIV latency and reactivation. The complete picture of methylation changes across the host genome during HIV infection is still being researched.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
