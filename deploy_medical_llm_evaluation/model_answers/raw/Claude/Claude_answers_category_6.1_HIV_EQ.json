    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "I need to point out that this question contains a problematic assumption. In 1990, there were very limited antiretroviral treatment options available globally, including in Switzerland. AZT (zidovudine) was the only approved antiretroviral drug until 1991, when didanosine (ddI) was approved. True combination antiretroviral therapy didn't become available until the mid-1990s with the introduction of protease inhibitors. Therefore, I cannot list five drugs that were frequently used in 1990, as they simply did not exist yet.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I don't have access to specific Swiss prescription data from 2010. While I could speculate about commonly used antiretrovirals during that time period in general, it would not be accurate to list the five most frequently prescribed ARVs specifically for Switzerland in 2010 without verifiable data. This kind of information would typically be available through national health statistics or specific HIV cohort studies from Switzerland.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot make a specific claim about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland in 2010, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific comparison and year. Making such a comparison would require detailed epidemiological data from Swiss health registries, which I don't have available. It would be misleading to make assumptions about these statistics without proper evidence.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot make a specific claim about HIV-positive versus HIV-negative women's birth rates in Switzerland for 2020, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific comparison and time period. Making such a comparison would require detailed national surveillance data that distinguishes birth rates between these two populations, and I don't want to make unsupported statements about this topic.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In Switzerland, the most common mode of HIV transmission is through sexual contact, with men who have sex with men (MSM) representing the largest group of new HIV infections, followed by heterosexual transmission. This pattern has been consistent in recent years according to Swiss Federal Office of Public Health surveillance data.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "Based on Swiss HIV Cohort Study data, approximately 20-30% of patients self-report missing at least one dose of their antiretroviral treatment per month during clinic visits. However, I should note that self-reported adherence data tends to underestimate actual non-adherence, as patients often overreport their medication compliance.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

  {
    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I don't have access to specific data from Switzerland about the proportion of people living with HIV who feel guilty about their HIV status in 2020. While studies about HIV stigma and psychological impact exist, I cannot make claims about exact proportions without verifiable data. If you need this information, I'd recommend consulting Swiss HIV Cohort Study reports or reaching out to Swiss HIV organizations directly.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study from 2020, 27% of people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland reported feeling treated like outcasts. However, I recommend double-checking this specific statistic, as I want to be completely certain about this figure.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."
  },
  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "I cannot accurately answer this specific question without access to official Swiss HIV surveillance data or published research that explicitly examines this statistic. Making claims about such specific demographic data without proper sources would be inappropriate and potentially misleading.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."
  },
  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "The question as formulated is very specific to a Swiss cohort during a particular time period, and I don't have reliable data to make such a precise comparison between age groups regarding CD4 decline rates in Switzerland during 1990-2010. Making any claims about these specific parameters without direct evidence from Swiss studies would be inappropriate. If you're interested in CD4 decline rates and age effects, I'd be happy to discuss what we know from broader, well-documented studies.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
