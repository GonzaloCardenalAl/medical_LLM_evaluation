    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Positive EBV DNA in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n3. MRI findings: solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion in corpus callosum\n4. Clinical symptoms: headaches, confusion, neurological deficits\n5. Subacute presentation over 2 weeks\n\nPCNSL in HIV patients is typically EBV-driven and occurs in severely immunocompromised individuals. The MRI finding of a weakly ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum is particularly characteristic of PCNSL, as opposed to other HIV-associated CNS conditions like toxoplasmosis (which typically shows multiple strongly ring-enhancing lesions).",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20, brand name Fuzeon) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thereby blocking the conformational changes required for viral fusion with the cell membrane. However, it's important to note that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its need for twice-daily subcutaneous injection and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with limited options.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms (fever, malaise, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy, positive HIV test, and relatively high CD4 count (650/mm3), this patient is most likely in the Acute HIV Infection stage, also known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome or Primary HIV Infection.\n\nThis stage typically occurs 2-4 weeks after initial HIV exposure and presents with flu-like symptoms. The CD4 count is still relatively preserved at this stage, which fits with the value of 650/mm3 in this case.\n\nThese symptoms typically resolve spontaneously within a few weeks as the body develops an initial immune response, leading to the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, night sweats, productive cough), low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the finding of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods, this patient likely has Nocardiosis.\n\nThe drug of choice for Nocardia infection is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Its mechanism of action involves:\n\n1. Trimethoprim: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\n2. Sulfamethoxazole: Competitively inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, preventing the incorporation of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) into dihydropteroic acid\n\nTogether, these actions block two sequential steps in the bacterial folate synthesis pathway, resulting in decreased production of purines and ultimately inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis. This dual blockade makes TMP-SMX a particularly effective bactericidal agent against Nocardia.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The gp120 surface glycoprotein would be the most likely target for antibody development. Here's why:\n\n1. gp120 is part of the HIV envelope protein complex\n2. It's located on the surface of the virus, making it accessible to antibodies\n3. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors\n4. It's one of the main targets of neutralizing antibodies in natural infection\n\nWhile other viral proteins exist (like gp41), gp120 has been a major focus of HIV vaccine and therapeutic antibody research due to its accessibility and critical function in viral entry.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. The clinical presentation (fever, hemoptysis), radiographic finding (fibrocavitary lesion), and most importantly, the microscopic finding of septate hyphae branching at acute angles (45-degree angles) are classical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which is a significant opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with advanced HIV disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The greatest risk when adding valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen is bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia and anemia). This risk is especially significant because the patient is already taking zidovudine (AZT), which is also known to cause bone marrow suppression.\n\nThe combination of valganciclovir and zidovudine can lead to additive hematologic toxicity, potentially causing:\n- Worsening anemia (patient already shows pallor)\n- Neutropenia\n- Thrombocytopenia\n\nThis patient will need careful monitoring of complete blood counts (CBC) during treatment. If severe bone marrow suppression develops, dose adjustments or medication changes may be necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn born to an HIV-positive mother, the most appropriate diagnostic test is HIV DNA PCR testing. \n\nThis test should be performed at:\n- 14-21 days of age\n- 1-2 months\n- 4-6 months\n\nHIV antibody testing is not appropriate for newborns because maternal antibodies cross the placenta and can persist in the infant for up to 18 months, leading to false-positive results. The DNA PCR test directly detects viral genetic material, making it the most reliable early diagnostic test for infants.\n\nIn the meantime, the mother should be started on antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step is to:\n\n1. Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk and needs testing\n\n2. Explain that while patient confidentiality is important, many states have partner notification laws requiring that sexual partners be informed of potential HIV exposure\n\n3. Refer the patient to the local health department for partner services, which can assist with anonymous notification\n\n4. Document these counseling efforts in detail\n\nThe physician cannot directly inform the wife due to HIPAA privacy regulations and patient confidentiality, even though she is also a patient. However, the physician should emphasize the serious public health implications and ethical obligation to inform sexual partners. If the patient continues to refuse disclosure, the physician should involve the health department, which has established protocols for partner notification while maintaining the source patient's confidentiality.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this patient has acute pancreatitis. The most likely etiology in this case is medication-induced pancreatitis, specifically from antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\nKey points supporting this assessment:\n1. The patient is on HIV medications, though unable to recall which ones\n2. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine, stavudine, and less commonly other NRTIs, are known to cause pancreatitis\n3. The CT shows no gallstones (biliary causes ruled out)\n4. While alcohol use is reported, it's described as \"moderate social\" use, making alcoholic pancreatitis less likely\n5. Other potential causes (trauma, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia) are not evident from the provided information\n\nThe next steps should include:\n1. Reviewing the specific ART regimen\n2. Considering temporary discontinuation/modification of the regimen in consultation with an HIV specialist\n3. Providing supportive care for acute pancreatitis",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) primarily works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that prevents HIV from converting its RNA into DNA, which is a crucial step in viral replication. By incorporating itself into the growing viral DNA chain, it acts as a chain terminator, preventing further addition of nucleotides and thus blocking viral DNA synthesis. This helps reduce maternal-to-child transmission of HIV during labor and delivery.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation patterns differ between latent and active HIV-1 infection:\n\nIn latent HIV:\n- The HIV-1 promoter region (5' LTR) is typically hypermethylated \n- This methylation contributes to viral silencing and maintenance of latency\n- CpG islands in the viral promoter are key methylation sites\n\nIn active infection:\n- The viral promoter region shows reduced methylation\n- This hypomethylation allows for active viral transcription\n- Host cell genes also show altered methylation patterns\n\nHowever, many aspects of HIV-related DNA methylation dynamics remain under investigation, and the complete picture of methylation changes across infection stages is still being researched. The field continues to evolve as new studies emerge.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
