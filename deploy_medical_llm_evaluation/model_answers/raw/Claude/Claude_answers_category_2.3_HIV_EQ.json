    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nKey supporting findings:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. EBV-positive CSF PCR\n3. Characteristic MRI findings (solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion in corpus callosum)\n4. Progressive neurological symptoms\n5. PCNSL is strongly associated with EBV infection in HIV patients\n\nThis AIDS-defining malignancy typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients (CD4 <100) and requires brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis, though the combination of EBV-positive CSF and characteristic imaging is highly suggestive.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20, brand name Fuzeon) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thus blocking the conformational changes required for viral fusion with the cell membrane. However, it's important to note that enfuvirtide is not typically used as first-line therapy due to its need for twice-daily subcutaneous injections and is usually reserved for salvage therapy in treatment-experienced patients with multidrug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms (fever, malaise, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy, positive HIV test, and relatively high CD4 count (650/mm3), this patient is most likely in the Acute HIV Infection stage, also known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome or Primary HIV Infection.\n\nThis stage typically occurs 2-4 weeks after initial infection and presents with flu-like symptoms. The CD4 count is usually still preserved at this stage, which matches the presented value of 650/mm3.\n\nThe symptoms described are classic for acute HIV infection, and this phase typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks as the patient enters the clinical latency period.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, night sweats, productive cough), low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the finding of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods in BAL, this patient likely has Nocardia infection.\n\nThe drug of choice for Nocardia infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Its mechanism of action involves:\n\n1. Trimethoprim: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\n2. Sulfamethoxazole: Competes with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase\n\nTogether, these agents provide a sequential blockade of folate metabolism, which is essential for bacterial DNA synthesis. This dual mechanism makes TMP-SMX particularly effective against Nocardia and other susceptible organisms.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target would be gp120, which is a glycoprotein on the HIV envelope surface.\n\nThis is because:\n1. gp120 is exposed on the virus surface\n2. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors\n3. It's one of the main targets for neutralizing antibodies\n4. It's highly immunogenic and commonly targeted by natural antibodies\n\nThis makes gp120 an ideal target for therapeutic antibody development, though its high mutation rate does present challenges for broad neutralization.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. The clinical presentation (fever, hemoptysis), radiographic finding (fibrocavitary lesion), and most importantly, the microscopic finding of septate hyphae branching at acute angles (approximately 45 degrees) are classical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This opportunistic infection is more common in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, particularly when CD4 counts are very low.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The greatest risk when adding valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen is bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia and anemia), as both valganciclovir and zidovudine (AZT) can cause bone marrow suppression. This overlapping toxicity can be especially concerning because:\n\n1. Zidovudine is known to cause bone marrow suppression as one of its main side effects\n2. Valganciclovir commonly causes neutropenia and anemia\n3. The combination can lead to additive or synergistic myelotoxicity\n\nClose monitoring of complete blood counts would be necessary, and dose adjustments might be required if significant cytopenias develop.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For testing HIV in infants born to HIV-positive mothers, HIV DNA PCR testing is the most appropriate diagnostic test. This test should be performed at:\n- 14-21 days of life\n- 1-2 months\n- 4-6 months\n\nHIV antibody testing is not recommended for infants under 18 months because maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and persist in the infant, leading to false-positive results. The DNA PCR test directly detects the presence of viral genetic material, making it the most reliable early diagnostic test for HIV infection in infants.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step would be to:\n\n1. Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk and needs testing\n2. Inform him that while patient confidentiality is important, many states have laws requiring partners to be notified of potential HIV exposure\n3. Offer to assist with disclosure in a supported environment (such as having the discussion in the medical office)\n4. If he still refuses, inform him that public health authorities can assist with anonymous partner notification\n\nThe physician cannot directly tell the wife due to HIPAA regulations and patient confidentiality, even though she is also a patient. However, the case should be reported to public health authorities who can then implement partner notification programs while maintaining the source patient's confidentiality.\n\nThe primary goal is to protect the wife's health while respecting legal and ethical obligations regarding patient confidentiality.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and patient history, the most likely etiology of acute pancreatitis in this case is medication-induced, specifically due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here's why:\n\n1. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and less commonly other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), can cause pancreatitis as a side effect.\n\n2. The patient has a relatively recent HIV diagnosis (6 months) and is on ART, though she can't recall the specific medications.\n\n3. Other common causes seem less likely:\n- No gallstones visible on CT\n- BMI is normal (21 kg/m2), making metabolic causes less likely\n- Only moderate alcohol use reported (not heavy drinking)\n- Triglycerides weren't mentioned as being elevated\n\nThe next steps would be to:\n1. Review her current ART regimen\n2. Consider temporarily holding suspected causative medications\n3. Consider alternative ART regimens if medication-induced pancreatitis is confirmed\n\nWould recommend checking triglycerides and other metabolic parameters to rule out other potential causes as well.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) primarily works by inhibiting reverse transcription. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing HIV from converting its RNA genome into DNA. This disrupts HIV's ability to integrate into the host cell's genome and replicate.\n\nIn this urgent intrapartum scenario, IV zidovudine is used as prophylaxis to reduce mother-to-child transmission, even though it's not as effective as full combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy would have been.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation profiles differ between latent and active HIV-1 infection:\n\nIn latent HIV infection:\n- The HIV promoter region tends to be hypermethylated\n- This methylation contributes to viral latency by suppressing viral gene expression\n- CpG islands in the 5' LTR are typically methylated\n\nIn active HIV infection:\n- The viral promoter region shows reduced methylation\n- This hypomethylation allows for active viral transcription\n- The 5' LTR tends to be unmethylated\n\nHowever, it's important to note that our understanding of methylation patterns in HIV infection is still evolving, and more research is needed to fully characterize the epigenetic landscape in different stages of infection.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
