    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum, lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, in the context of a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, are all consistent with this diagnosis. PCNSL is a common opportunistic malignancy in individuals with advanced HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, it's worth noting that Enfuvirtide is not typically a first-line treatment for HIV and is usually reserved for salvage therapy or in cases of resistance to other medications.\n\nA more commonly used class of medications that target the HIV envelope glycoprotein is the fusion inhibitors' related class, but specifically, the gp41 subunit is targeted by Enfuvirtide.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and lab results, this patient is most likely in the acute or primary stage of HIV infection, also known as acute retroviral syndrome. The symptoms of fever, malaise, and diarrhea, along with the enlarged lymph nodes, are consistent with this stage. The high CD4+ count of 650/mm3 also suggests that the patient is in the early stages of infection, as CD4+ counts typically decline over time in untreated HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection, likely Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The most appropriate drug for managing this condition is azithromycin. \n\nThe mechanism of action of azithromycin is the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial cell, which prevents the translocation of peptides and ultimately leads to the inhibition of bacterial growth.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody is the gp120 or gp41 protein, which are components of the HIV envelope. These proteins are the primary targets of the natural humoral immune response and are also the proteins detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn, the most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection would be the HIV DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or HIV RNA PCR (also known as viral load test). \n\nThis test can detect the genetic material of the virus and can be used as early as a few days after birth. It's recommended to perform the test at 14-21 days of life, and then again at 1-2 months and 4-6 months to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nNote: Antibody tests are not used for diagnosing HIV in newborns because they can detect maternal antibodies, which can be present in the baby's blood for up to 18 months, even if the baby is not infected.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "This is a complex situation involving patient confidentiality and public health concerns. The most appropriate next step would be to counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk of infection. However, the physician cannot disclose the patient's diagnosis to his wife without his consent, due to confidentiality laws.\n\nThe physician should explain the risks of HIV transmission to the patient and encourage him to disclose his status to his wife. The physician can also offer to facilitate a joint counseling session with the patient and his wife, or provide resources for the patient to disclose his status to his wife in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nIt's also important to note that in many jurisdictions, there are laws and regulations that require reporting of HIV cases to public health authorities, but this does not necessarily mean that the patient's wife will be notified. The physician should be familiar with the specific laws and regulations in their area and follow them accordingly.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of her condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with this diagnosis. Given her history of moderate social alcohol use, alcohol-induced pancreatitis is a possible cause. However, other potential causes, such as medication-induced pancreatitis (e.g., from her HIV medications or metformin, although less common), should also be considered. Further investigation into her medication regimen and other potential causes is necessary to determine the underlying etiology.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its action mechanism most likely disrupts the biological process of reverse transcription, which is a critical step in the replication cycle of the HIV virus. Reverse transcription is the process by which the viral RNA genome is converted into DNA, allowing the virus to integrate into the host cell's genome. By inhibiting this process, zidovudine reduces the replication of the virus, thereby decreasing the viral load and the risk of perinatal transmission.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, and its profiles have been studied in the context of HIV-1 infection. Research suggests that HIV-1 infection alters DNA methylation patterns in host cells, particularly in immune cells such as CD4+ T cells.\n\nIn patients with latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation profiles are associated with the suppression of viral transcription. Specifically, the HIV-1 promoter region is hypermethylated, which contributes to the silencing of viral gene expression.\n\nIn contrast, active HIV-1 infection is characterized by hypomethylation of the viral genome and host genes involved in immune activation and inflammation. This leads to increased viral replication and immune activation.\n\nAdditionally, studies have identified specific DNA methylation signatures associated with HIV-1 infection, including changes in methylation patterns at genes involved in immune response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.\n\nThese findings suggest that DNA methylation plays a key role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression and may contribute to the establishment and maintenance of latency. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these changes and their potential implications for HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
