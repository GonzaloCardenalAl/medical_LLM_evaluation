    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV diagnosis typically involves a combination of tests. The most common approach is:\n\n1. **Rapid HIV test** or **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)**: These tests detect antibodies against HIV in the blood. If positive, they are usually confirmed with:\n2. **Western Blot test**: This test also detects antibodies and is more specific.\n3. **Nucleic Acid Test (NAT)**: This test detects the genetic material of the virus itself, often used for early detection or confirmation.\n4. **CD4 cell count and viral load tests**: These tests are used to monitor the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment, but not for initial diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to note that there is a window period, typically 2-4 weeks after exposure, during which the virus may not be detectable by these tests. Repeat testing may be necessary if exposure is suspected to have occurred during this window.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "The different stages of HIV are:\n\n1. **Acute HIV Infection**: The initial stage, occurring 2-4 weeks after infection, where the virus replicates rapidly.\n2. **Clinical Latency** (also known as asymptomatic HIV or chronic HIV): The virus is still active, but at low levels, and the person may not show symptoms. This stage can last for years.\n3. **Symptomatic HIV**: The virus has damaged the immune system, and symptoms such as opportunistic infections and cancers start to appear.\n4. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: The most advanced stage, where the immune system is severely weakened, and the person is susceptible to life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers.\n\nIt's worth noting that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people living with HIV can suppress the virus and prevent progression to the later stages.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at increased risk for several comorbidities, including:\n\n1. Cardiovascular disease\n2. Hepatitis B and C coinfection\n3. Mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety)\n4. Substance use disorders\n5. Chronic kidney disease\n6. Osteoporosis\n7. Certain cancers (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma)\n8. Neurocognitive disorders\n9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n10. Diabetes mellitus\n\nThese comorbidities can be related to the infection itself, antiretroviral therapy (ART) side effects, or shared risk factors. Regular screening and management of these conditions are essential for overall health and well-being in people living with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV prevention methods include:\n\n1. **Consistent and correct use of condoms** during vaginal and anal sex.\n2. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: taking antiretroviral medication daily to prevent HIV infection.\n3. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: taking antiretroviral medication within 72 hours of potential exposure to prevent infection.\n4. **Harm reduction strategies** for people who inject drugs, such as using sterile needles and syringes.\n5. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** for people living with HIV to suppress the virus, making it less likely to transmit to others.\n6. **Voluntary medical male circumcision** to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV.\n7. **Avoiding sharing personal items** that may have come into contact with blood or bodily fluids.\n\nIt's essential to combine these methods for optimal prevention.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch from latent HIV to active infection is a complex process, not fully understood. However, it's known that latency is maintained by a balance between viral replication and host immune responses. Reactivation can occur due to various factors, including:\n\n1. Immune activation: Inflammation or immune stimulation can trigger latent viruses to replicate.\n2. Cellular activation: Activation of latently infected cells, such as T-cells, can lead to viral reactivation.\n3. Epigenetic changes: Modifications to the viral genome or host chromatin can influence viral expression.\n4. Random stochastic events: Random fluctuations in gene expression may also contribute to reactivation.\n\nResearch is ongoing to better understand the mechanisms underlying this switch, but it's clear that it involves a delicate interplay between the virus, host immune responses, and cellular factors.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
