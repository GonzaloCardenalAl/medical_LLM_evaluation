    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. Based on historical data, the following antiretroviral drugs were among the most frequently administered in the late 1980s and early 1990s:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was approved in 1994, so it's unlikely to be one of the top 5 in 1990.\n5. The fifth one is tricky, as the options were limited. However, it's possible that it could be Ribavirin, although it was not commonly used as a single agent for HIV treatment, or Acyclovir, which was sometimes used in combination with AZT, although not specifically approved for HIV.\n\nPlease note that the exact ranking might be difficult to determine, and the treatment landscape was rapidly evolving during that time. These medications were often used in monotherapy, which is no longer the standard of care today.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, the five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland in 2010 were:\n\n1. Tenofovir (TDF)\n2. Emtricitabine (FTC)\n3. Efavirenz (EFV)\n4. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)\n5. Abacavir (ABC)\n\nPlease note that treatment guidelines and drug usage can change over time, and this information may not reflect current practices.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in 2010, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population. However, with the advancement of antiretroviral therapy, many women with HIV are able to have healthy pregnancies. I'd recommend checking the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or specific studies from that time period for the most accurate and up-to-date information on birth rates.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in Switzerland, the birth rate among women with HIV has been increasing over the years due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved healthcare. However, I couldn't find the most up-to-date and specific data on the overall birth rate in Switzerland for 2020, comparing women with and without HIV.\n\nThe Swiss HIV Cohort Study and other sources may have published relevant data, but I would need to check the latest research or reports to provide a precise answer. If you're looking for the most current information, I recommend consulting the latest publications or contacting the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or relevant health organizations directly.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland is men who have sex with men (MSM), accounting for approximately 60-70% of new HIV diagnoses. Heterosexual transmission and transmission through injecting drug use are less common. However, it's essential to note that these figures may vary depending on the year and specific population.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "I'm not aware of the specific data on treatment adherence in Switzerland, particularly the proportion of visits involving patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month. This information would typically be found in studies or reports from Swiss health authorities or research institutions. If you're looking for accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting the latest research or official health reports from Switzerland.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To answer this question accurately, I would need to refer to specific epidemiological studies or research data focusing on the Swiss population with HIV, diagnosed between 1990 and 2010, and with an initial CD4 count above 300. The age at diagnosis (before or after 20) and its impact on the rate of CD4 decline to below 200 cells/\u03bcL is a nuanced topic that can be influenced by various factors including, but not limited to, the viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle factors, and the presence of co-infections.\n\nWithout access to specific studies or data that directly address this question within the context of the Swiss population during the specified time frame, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. The progression of HIV and the rate of CD4 cell count decline can vary significantly among individuals based on numerous factors, including those mentioned above.\n\nIf such specific data or studies exist, they would likely be found in peer-reviewed journals or reports from health organizations focusing on HIV/AIDS research and epidemiology in Switzerland. It's also worth noting that the introduction and evolution of antiretroviral therapy during the 1990s and 2000s significantly impacted the management and progression of HIV, potentially influencing the outcomes for individuals diagnosed during this period.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
