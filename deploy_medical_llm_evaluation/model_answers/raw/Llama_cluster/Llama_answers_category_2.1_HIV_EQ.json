    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation and diagnostic findings are suggestive of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of a low CD4 count, symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, confusion, ataxia, and memory impairment, along with the radiographic finding of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion, and the detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, are all consistent with this diagnosis. PCNSL is a known complication in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with advanced HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, it's worth noting that Enfuvirtide is not typically a first-line treatment and is usually reserved for treatment-experienced patients.\n\nA more commonly used class of medications that target the HIV envelope is the attachment inhibitors or fusion inhibitors, but a specific class that targets the gp41 subunit is the fusion inhibitors. \n\nIn current practice, a more commonly used medication that targets the gp41 subunit is not typically the first choice for initial therapy. Initial therapy usually involves a combination of medications from classes such as NRTIs, NNRTIs, or Integrase inhibitors.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and laboratory results, this patient is most likely in the acute or early stage of HIV infection, also known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS). The symptoms of fever, malaise, and diarrhea, along with the presence of enlarged lymph nodes, are consistent with ARS, which typically occurs 2-4 weeks after HIV infection. The CD4+ count of 650/mm3 is still within the normal range, which is also consistent with early infection, as CD4+ counts often remain normal or near-normal in the early stages of HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of Nocardia infection, given the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods in the bronchoalveolar lavage.\n\nThe most appropriate drug for managing Nocardia infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The mechanism of action of TMP-SMX involves inhibiting folic acid synthesis in bacteria. Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, while sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, thereby preventing the production of tetrahydrofolate, which is essential for bacterial DNA synthesis. This results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and ultimately, bacterial death.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody is the gp120 protein, which is part of the HIV envelope. gp120 is a surface protein that plays a key role in viral entry and is a primary target of the natural humoral immune response. It is also one of the proteins detected by ELISA and Western blot assays used to diagnose HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation and biopsy findings are suggestive of a fungal infection. Given the presence of septate hyphae that branch at acute angles, the most likely causal organism is Aspergillus. Specifically, in an HIV-positive patient with these symptoms and radiographic findings, invasive aspergillosis is a strong consideration.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, which includes zidovudine, increases the risk of hematologic adverse effects, particularly neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased blood cell counts. The combination of these two medications may potentiate this effect, putting the patient at a higher risk for neutropenia and potentially other cytopenias. Close monitoring of the patient's blood counts will be necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn, the most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection would be the HIV PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, specifically the HIV DNA PCR or HIV RNA PCR. This test can detect the virus itself, rather than antibodies, which are maternal antibodies that can cross the placenta and do not necessarily indicate infection in the newborn. The HIV PCR test can be performed as early as a few days after birth.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "A complex and sensitive situation. The physician has a duty to maintain patient confidentiality, but also a responsibility to prevent harm to others. In this case, the physician should inform the patient that they cannot guarantee confidentiality in situations where there is a risk of harm to others, such as HIV transmission to a spouse.\n\nThe most appropriate next step would be to encourage the patient to disclose his diagnosis to his wife, and offer to facilitate this disclosure or provide resources for counseling and support. If the patient refuses, the physician should inform him that they may be required to report the case to public health authorities, who can then take steps to notify the spouse while maintaining the patient's anonymity.\n\nIt's also important to note that the physician's duty to protect the patient's confidentiality is not absolute, and may be overridden by the duty to prevent harm to others. The specific laws and regulations regarding HIV disclosure vary by jurisdiction, and the physician should be familiar with these laws and consult with their medical board or ethics committee if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of her condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nGiven her HIV status, it's possible that her pancreatitis could be related to her antiretroviral therapy (ART), as some ART medications can increase the risk of pancreatitis. However, without knowing the specific medications she's taking, it's difficult to say for certain. Other potential causes, such as alcohol use or gallstones, are less likely given her moderate alcohol use and normal gallbladder on CT. Further evaluation and consultation with her HIV care team may be helpful to determine the underlying cause of her pancreatitis.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine (AZT) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for the replication of retroviruses like HIV. \n\nThe biological process most likely disrupted by zidovudine is reverse transcription, the process by which the viral RNA genome is converted into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome. By inhibiting reverse transcription, zidovudine prevents the replication of HIV, thereby reducing the viral load and the risk of perinatal transmission.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation plays a role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression. In patients with latent HIV-1 infection, the viral genome is often methylated, which helps to suppress viral transcription and maintain latency. In contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with hypomethylation of the viral genome, allowing for active transcription and replication.\n\nStudies have also shown that HIV-1 infection can alter the host cell's DNA methylation profile, leading to changes in gene expression that may contribute to immune dysfunction and disease progression. Specifically, HIV-1 infection has been linked to changes in DNA methylation patterns in genes involved in immune response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.\n\nHowever, the exact mechanisms by which HIV-1 infection alters host cell DNA methylation profiles are not fully understood and require further research.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
