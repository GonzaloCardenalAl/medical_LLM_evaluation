    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and brain biopsy results, the most likely cause of her current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The brain biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes are consistent with PML. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, resulting in a low CD4 count, has likely increased her risk of developing this condition.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the clinical presentation suggests an opportunistic infection. The low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) indicates a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to various opportunistic infections.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis, considering the gastrointestinal symptoms and the patient's immunocompromised state, could be an opportunistic infection such as cryptosporidiosis or microsporidiosis, which are known to cause watery diarrhea in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts. However, without the stool microscopy results, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. Other possibilities could include infections like giardiasis or bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Shigella, though the latter typically present with more systemic symptoms and a higher fever.\n\nGiven the patient's non-compliance with ART, re-initiation or adjustment of antiretroviral therapy, along with treatment for the opportunistic infection once identified, would be crucial. Empirical treatment may be considered based on clinical judgment while awaiting diagnostic results.",

When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, it's crucial to address both the depression and the potential for opportunistic infections due to the low CD4+ count.\n\nFor the depression, I would recommend starting an antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used and generally safe in patients with HIV. Examples include fluoxetine, sertraline, or escitalopram.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), prophylaxis against opportunistic infections should be considered. Specifically, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for patients with a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3. Additionally, considering the patient's immune status, prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis and possibly other opportunistic infections may be necessary, but this would depend on further evaluation and specific risk factors.\n\nIt's also essential to restart or adjust the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to improve his CD4+ count and viral suppression. This should be done under the guidance of an HIV specialist, considering the potential for drug resistance due to the patient's history of non-adherence.",

    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a neurological complication related to HIV, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), toxoplasmosis, or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering stroke given the family history and the patient's vascular risk factors.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately order imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for these potential causes. Additionally, given the fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures, and possibly a lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated by the imaging findings) should be considered to evaluate for CNS infections. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current HIV viral load and to review his adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), as improving adherence or adjusting his ART regimen may be necessary. \n\nGiven the acute presentation, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Neurology consultation would be beneficial to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. \n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is azithromycin (500 mg daily) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for at least 3 months. Alternatively, erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) can be used. \n\nIt's also essential to manage the patient's underlying HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve her immune status.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation and the response to 5% acetic acid solution (which causes the lesions to turn white, a phenomenon known as acetowhitening) are suggestive of condylomata acuminata, also known as genital warts. The etiology of these lesions is infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly low-risk types such as HPV 6 and 11. The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV infection may contribute to the development and persistence of these lesions.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, in conjunction with a significant increase in CD4+ T cell count and a decrease in HIV RNA after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART), suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Given that the sputum smear is negative and the patient was previously responding to tuberculosis (TB) treatment, the most likely diagnosis is paradoxical TB-IRIS.\n\nThe most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue the current antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol) and the antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine) without changes. Additionally, consider initiating anti-inflammatory treatment, such as prednisone, to manage the symptoms of IRIS, under close monitoring.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, morbid obesity, and proteinuria, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-positive patients, particularly those of African descent. The presence of proteinuria and edema supports this diagnosis. However, further evaluation, including renal ultrasound and potentially a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of kidney disease, such as diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests a complex clinical picture, but key findings include a holodiastolic murmur, which could indicate infective endocarditis, particularly in the context of HIV and possible non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray could suggest mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is common in lymphoma, but could also be seen in other conditions. The neurological findings (pupils not reactive to light but constricting to near response, suggesting Argyll Robertson pupils) are classically associated with neurosyphilis, particularly in the context of HIV.\n\nGiven the combination of possible infective endocarditis, neurological findings suggestive of neurosyphilis, and the patient's history of HIV with possible immune suppression due to non-adherence to therapy, the most likely diagnosis could involve these elements. However, the question asks for the diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities, which aren't explicitly detailed in the scenario provided.\n\nWithout specific metabolic abnormalities mentioned, it's challenging to provide targeted therapy. However, addressing the potential underlying causes such as infective endocarditis (with appropriate antibiotics), treating syphilis (with penicillin), and optimizing HIV management (by improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy and potentially adjusting the regimen) would be crucial. Additionally, managing any related conditions, such as hypertension (with the blood pressure of 160/70 mmHg) and ensuring proper treatment of any opportunistic infections or malignancies (given the widened mediastinum), would be important.\n\nFor the metabolic aspects, without more specific information, general supportive care including hydration, nutrition, and potentially correcting any electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances would be necessary. The question seems to lack specific details on metabolic abnormalities, making it difficult to provide a precise therapeutic plan for reversal.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). This condition occurs when large numbers of cancer cells die rapidly, releasing their contents into the bloodstream, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute kidney injury, as seen in this patient's lab results. The high serum uric acid level and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine and BUN) are consistent with TLS, a known complication of chemotherapy, especially in patients with bulky disease like Burkitt's lymphoma.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
