    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, and brain biopsy results showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes, the most likely cause of her current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has likely contributed to her immunocompromised state and increased susceptibility to PML.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the medications started, specifically:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatotoxicity** with lamivudine and zidovudine (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n2. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)** and **hyperbilirubinemia** with indinavir (protease inhibitor).\n3. **Lipodystrophy syndrome** (changes in body fat distribution) and **metabolic abnormalities** (e.g., dyslipidemia, insulin resistance) with the combination of these medications.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's viral load is relatively low, and the CD4 count is high, which may indicate that the patient is in the early stages of HIV infection. Regular monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and manage any potential side effects.",

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, along with the PCR results showing Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). However, the presence of a solitary lesion and the patient's clinical presentation could also suggest Toxoplasmosis or another opportunistic infection. Given the EBV PCR positivity, PCNSL is a strong consideration, but further diagnostic workup, such as biopsy, may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the clinical presentation suggests an opportunistic infection. The low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) indicates a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to various opportunistic pathogens.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis, considering the symptoms and the patient's immune status, could be an infection caused by an opportunistic pathogen such as Cryptosporidium, Isospora, or Microsporidia, which are known to cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, especially those with low CD4 counts. However, without the stool microscopy results, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Other possibilities could include bacterial infections like Salmonella or Campylobacter, but the diagnosis would depend on the stool test results and potentially other diagnostic tests.",

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of progressive neurological decline (weakness, unsteady gait, falls, forgetfulness, difficulty with familiar tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness), somnolence, and confusion, along with the laboratory findings (low CD4+ count, high HIV viral load, and specific MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions), the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), possibly with a component of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) given the white matter lesions. However, the lack of mass effect and the description of the lesions as nonenhancing are more suggestive of HIV leukoencephalopathy or other forms of HAND rather than PML, which typically shows focal or multifocal white matter lesions that can be asymmetric and may have a characteristic \"scraped cortex\" appearance on MRI, often with mass effect. The clinical and radiological picture, in conjunction with the severely immunocompromised state (CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL and high viral load), points towards a diagnosis related to advanced HIV disease affecting the central nervous system. \n\nToxoplasmosis and cryptococcal infection, common opportunistic infections in HIV, seem less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen and the MRI description not typical for toxoplasmosis (which usually presents with ring-enhancing lesions). \n\nA definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation, including potentially a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis and consideration of brain biopsy in some cases, but the clinical context and imaging findings strongly suggest a condition related to advanced HIV disease.",

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, it's crucial to address both the HIV treatment and the mental health issue. For the depression, I would recommend initiating or adjusting antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n\nIn terms of HIV management, with a CD4 count of 33 cells/mm3, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections. I would recommend prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and consideration for prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) if the CD4 count remains below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's also essential to reassess and optimize the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, considering potential resistance patterns due to the six-month treatment interruption.

An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, including cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and the findings on the physical examination (crackles, dullness to percussion, and expiratory wheezing) along with the chest x-ray showing a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is pneumonia. The patient's history of HIV infection with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 280/mm^3, which is below normal, indicates a compromised immune system, making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections. However, the specific type of pneumonia (bacterial, viral, or fungal) cannot be determined without further diagnostic testing. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) would be high on the differential diagnosis list given the clinical presentation, but the patient's immunocompromised state also raises the possibility of opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), especially if the CD4 count were lower. However, with a CD4 count of 280/mm^3 and the presence of malodorous phlegm, bacterial pneumonia is a strong consideration. Further testing, including blood cultures, sputum Gram stain, and possibly induced sputum for PCP if initial treatments fail, would be necessary to guide specific therapy.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a neurological complication related to HIV, such as toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or a CNS lymphoma. However, the acute onset and focal nature of the weakness also raise the possibility of a stroke, particularly given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to urgently perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for these potential causes. Additionally, given the fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures, a complete blood count (CBC), and other relevant laboratory tests should be obtained. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current viral load and consider the possibility of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) if the patient has recently started or changed antiretroviral therapy.\n\nImmediate initiation of thrombolytic therapy for a potential stroke should be considered if the onset of symptoms can be timed accurately and if there are no contraindications. However, given the complexity of this patient's presentation and the need to rule out other causes, consultation with a neurologist and possibly an infectious disease specialist is advisable.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of this condition.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is antibiotics, specifically:\n\n* Erythromycin 500 mg orally four times a day for at least 3 months, or\n* Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for at least 3 months.\n\nIt's also important to note that this patient's low CD4 count and history of IV drug use put her at risk for other opportunistic infections, and her HIV treatment regimen should be optimized. However, the primary treatment for the skin lesions is antibiotics targeting the Bartonella species.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The description of the skin lesions and the response to 5% acetic acid solution is highly suggestive of condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts. The etiology of these lesions is infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly low-risk types 6 and 11. The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV likely increases his susceptibility to HPV infection and the development of these lesions.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of subjective fever, cough, and night sweats. He states that over the past 2 months he has \u201cnot felt like myself.\u201d He has lost 12 lbs over this time period. Two weeks ago, he started experiencing night sweats and cough. This morning he decided to take his temperature and reports it was \u201chigh.\u201d He has a history of HIV and admits to inconsistently taking his anti-retrovirals. A chest radiograph reveals a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe. An interferon-gamma release assay is positive, and the patient is started on appropriate antimicrobial therapy. A month later he is seen in clinic for follow-up. Lab work is obtained, as shown below:\n\nLeukocyte count: 11,000/mm\u00b3 with normal differential\nHemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL\nPlatelet count: 400,000/mm\u00b3\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV): 75 \u00b5m\u00b3\n\nBased on these results, a peripheral smear is sent and shows Pappenheimer bodies. \n\n What is the most accurate test for the patient\u2019s diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The presence of Pappenheimer bodies on the peripheral smear suggests sideroblastic anemia, but in the context of this patient's history and lab results, it's more likely that the patient has anemia of chronic disease, possibly related to his HIV and/or tuberculosis (given the cavitary lesion and positive interferon-gamma release assay). However, the most accurate test for the patient's diagnosis, given the clinical context, would be to assess his response to the antimicrobial therapy for tuberculosis and to check his HIV viral load to assess adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Direct testing for iron overload or deficiency, such as serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin levels, would also be helpful in determining the cause of the anemia.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV and proteinuria, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a common cause of chronic kidney disease in individuals with HIV, particularly those of African descent. The presence of proteinuria and edema supports this diagnosis. However, further evaluation, including renal ultrasound and potentially a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) or another opportunistic infection, given his history of HIV and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray could indicate mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is consistent with TB or lymphoma. \n\nHowever, the most striking feature is the patient's neurologic examination, which suggests a diagnosis of neurosyphilis, given the presence of Argyll Robertson pupils (pupils that constrict when focusing on a near object but do not react to light) and a positive Romberg test (loss of balance when standing with eyes closed). \n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis, specifically neurosyphilis, is the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), along with a positive treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test or the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-EIA). The VDRL test on CSF is considered the gold standard for diagnosing neurosyphilis.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What therapy is most likely to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of chemotherapy, particularly in patients with bulky disease like Burkitt's lymphoma. The elevated uric acid, creatinine, BUN, and potassium levels are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe therapy most likely to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities is Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme, which breaks down uric acid into allantoin, a more soluble compound that can be easily excreted by the kidneys. This, along with aggressive hydration and possibly dialysis, can help manage TLS and reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities.",
    "true_answer": "Hemodialysis is the most likely therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
