    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, and the findings on MRI and brain biopsy, the most likely cause of her current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results are consistent with PML. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy has likely contributed to her immunocompromised state, increasing her risk of developing opportunistic infections like PML.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the clinical presentation suggests an opportunistic infection. The low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) indicates a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to various opportunistic infections.\n\nThe symptoms, particularly the watery diarrhea, could suggest a gastrointestinal infection. Common opportunistic pathogens in HIV patients with diarrhea include Cryptosporidium, Isospora, and Microsporidia, among others. However, without the stool microscopy results, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nGiven the right upper quadrant pain, another consideration could be a liver or biliary tract infection, but the normal physical examination and the absence of specific liver function test results in the provided information make it less clear.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis at this point, based on the information provided, would be an opportunistic gastrointestinal infection, with Cryptosporidiosis being a strong candidate given the symptoms of watery diarrhea and the patient's immunocompromised state. However, a definitive diagnosis awaits the stool microscopy results and possibly other diagnostic tests.",

During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, combined with the findings of right lower extremity weakness and the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically a form that could be progressing to or is consistent with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the presence of white matter lesions could also suggest other conditions such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), especially in the context of a very low CD4 count and high viral load. The lack of mass effect and the description of the lesions as nonenhancing might lean more towards PML, which is a serious condition caused by the JC virus and typically seen in immunocompromised patients. Further diagnostic evaluation, including possibly a brain biopsy or more specific testing for JC virus, would be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities and to guide appropriate management.",

His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to his HIV medication, it's crucial to address both the HIV treatment and the mental health issue. For the depression, I would recommend initiating antidepressant therapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), under the guidance of a mental health professional. \n\nRegarding his HIV management, with a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections. I would recommend prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and possibly against toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections based on his specific risk factors and CD4 count. \n\nIt's also essential to restart his antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible, and to consider a regimen that is simple, effective, and has a high barrier to resistance, given his history of non-adherence. Close monitoring and support to improve adherence will be crucial. Referral to a mental health professional for counseling and support to manage his depression and improve adherence to his HIV treatment is also necessary.",

What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one extremity, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a CNS (central nervous system) process, such as toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, or a stroke, which could be related to his HIV status or other vascular risk factors. \n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately order a non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, followed by an MRI of the brain with and without contrast to better evaluate for other potential causes such as toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which are more common in immunocompromised patients. Additionally, blood work including a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and a CD4 viral load should be drawn. \n\nGiven his fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures and consideration for empirical antibiotics or antiviral therapy may also be warranted. It's also crucial to assess his current antiretroviral therapy adherence and viral load to determine if his HIV is well-controlled, as this will guide further management decisions. Neurology consultation is also recommended for further evaluation and guidance.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, particularly the low CD4 count, skin lesions, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. The presence of small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of this condition.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is antibiotics. The first-line treatment typically involves the use of erythromycin (500 mg orally four times a day) or doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day) for at least 3 months to ensure complete resolution of the lesions and to prevent relapse. Given the patient's HIV status and potential for drug interactions, careful monitoring and adjustment of her antiretroviral therapy (if she is on it) may also be necessary. However, the primary treatment for BA is antibiotic therapy targeting the Bartonella species.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The description of the lesions and their response to 5% acetic acid solution (turning white) is characteristic of condylomata acuminata, also known as genital warts. The etiology of these lesions is infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted infection. The patient's social history of multiple sexual partners and HIV status increase his risk for HPV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is a common complication after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with advanced HIV infection, particularly those with tuberculosis. \n\nThe most appropriate initial step in treatment would be to continue the current antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol) and the antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine), and consider adding corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to manage the IRIS symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), which is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals, particularly those of African descent. The presence of proteinuria (2+ on urine dipstick) supports this diagnosis. HIVAN can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, edema, and decreased renal function, consistent with this patient's presentation. Further evaluation, including renal ultrasound and potentially a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation is complex, but the key findings include a holodiastolic murmur, fever, and a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray. The most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis, possibly due to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and subsequent immunocompromise.\n\nHowever, the description of the pupils not reacting to light but constricting when a pen tip is advanced closer (Argyll Robertson pupil) and the loss of balance with eyes closed (Romberg test) suggest neurosyphilis. \n\nThe widened mediastinum could be due to aortic dilatation or an aortic aneurysm, which can be a complication of syphilis (syphilitic aortitis).\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is tertiary syphilis, possibly with neurosyphilis and cardiovascular involvement. The therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities and treat the underlying condition would be penicillin-based antibiotics, specifically intravenous benzathine penicillin G, to treat syphilis. \n\nIt's essential to also address the patient's HIV management and adherence to antiretroviral therapy to improve his immune status.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation with decreased urinary output, elevated creatinine, BUN, and serum uric acid, along with hyperkalemia, suggests acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the recent initiation of chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma, the most likely diagnosis is tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a complication of cancer treatment that can cause AKI due to the rapid release of uric acid, potassium, and other substances from lysed cancer cells.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
