    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum, along with Epstein-Barr virus DNA detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, are all consistent with this diagnosis. PCNSL is a common opportunistic malignancy in immunocompromised patients with HIV, particularly those with low CD4+ counts.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, it's worth noting that Enfuvirtide is not typically used as a first-line treatment for HIV.\n\nA more commonly used class of medications that target the HIV envelope is the fusion inhibitors' relative, the attachment inhibitors, but specifically for gp41, the answer would be Enfuvirtide.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and laboratory results, this patient is most likely in the acute or early stage of HIV infection, also known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS). The presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, and diarrhea, along with a positive HIV-1 detection test and a relatively normal CD4+ count, are consistent with this stage. The CD4+ count of 650/mm3 is still within the normal range, which further supports this diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection, likely Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The most appropriate drug for managing this condition is azithromycin. \n\nThe mechanism of action of azithromycin is through the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial cell, which prevents the translocation of peptides and thus inhibits bacterial growth.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody is the gp120 or gp41 protein, which are part of the HIV envelope. These proteins are the primary targets of the natural humoral immune response and are also the proteins detected by ELISA and western blot assays. gp120 is involved in binding to CD4 receptors, while gp41 is involved in fusion with the host cell membrane. Both are key components of the HIV envelope and are potential targets for therapeutic antibodies.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, which includes zidovudine, puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, specifically neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, and their concurrent use increases the risk of this adverse effect. Close monitoring of the patient's complete blood count is necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn, the most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection would be the HIV PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, specifically the HIV DNA PCR or HIV RNA PCR. This test can directly detect the genetic material of the virus and is recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers. It's typically performed at 14-21 days of life, with repeat testing at 1-2 months and 4-6 months to confirm the diagnosis. \n\nNote: Antibody tests are not used for diagnosis in newborns because they can detect maternal antibodies, which can be present in the infant's blood for up to 18 months, regardless of the infant's infection status.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "This is a complex situation involving patient confidentiality and public health concerns. The most appropriate next step would be to counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk of infection. However, ultimately, the patient's confidentiality must be respected, as mandated by laws such as HIPAA in the US.\n\nThe physician should encourage the patient to voluntarily disclose his status to his wife and offer to facilitate this disclosure or provide resources for counseling. If the patient refuses, the physician may need to consult with local health authorities to determine the best course of action, as laws regarding mandatory reporting of HIV status vary by jurisdiction. The physician's primary obligation is to protect the patient's confidentiality while also considering the potential risk to the patient's wife.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms (severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting) and laboratory findings (elevated serum amylase and lipase), the diagnosis is acute pancreatitis. The most likely etiology in this case would be alcohol-related, given her reported moderate social alcohol use. However, other potential causes such as gallstones, medications (including some antiretroviral therapies used in HIV treatment), and hypertriglyceridemia (more common in patients with diabetes) should also be considered. The normal gallbladder on CT reduces the likelihood of gallstone pancreatitis. Further investigation into her HIV medications and lipid profile may help determine if there are other contributing factors.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its mechanism of action involves the disruption of the reverse transcription process, which is a critical step in the replication cycle of retroviruses like HIV. Specifically, zidovudine is incorporated into the viral DNA strand during reverse transcription, causing chain termination and thereby preventing the completion of the viral genome. \n\nSo, the biological process most likely disrupted by zidovudine's action mechanism is reverse transcription.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, and its profiles have been studied in the context of HIV-1 infection. Research has shown that HIV-1 infection can alter DNA methylation patterns in host cells, particularly in immune cells such as T cells and macrophages.\n\nIn patients with latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation profiles have been found to be associated with the suppression of viral transcription. Specifically, the HIV-1 proviral genome is often methylated, which helps to silence viral gene expression and maintain latency.\n\nIn contrast, active HIV-1 infection is characterized by changes in DNA methylation patterns that promote viral transcription and replication. For example, demethylation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region has been linked to increased viral transcription.\n\nAdditionally, studies have identified specific DNA methylation signatures associated with HIV-1 infection, including changes in methylation patterns at genes involved in immune response, cell signaling, and apoptosis. These changes can contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and may also serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression or response to treatment.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between DNA methylation, HIV-1 infection, and the host immune response.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
