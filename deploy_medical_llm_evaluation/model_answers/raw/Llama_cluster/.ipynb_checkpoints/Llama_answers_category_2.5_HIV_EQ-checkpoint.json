    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). \n\nThe key points supporting this diagnosis include:\n- The patient's immunocompromised state (low CD4+ count)\n- Neurological symptoms (headaches, blurred vision, confusion, ataxia, and memory impairment)\n- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis\n- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA positivity in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is often associated with PCNSL in HIV patients\n- The characteristic appearance of the lesion on MRI, which is a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum.\n\nPCNSL is a common complication in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ counts, and EBV is often implicated in its pathogenesis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, it's worth noting that Enfuvirtide is not typically used as a first-line treatment for HIV due to its injectable route of administration and the availability of more convenient oral options.\n\nA more commonly used class of medications that target the HIV envelope is the attachment inhibitors, but the specific drug that targets the gp41 subunit is Enfuvirtide.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and laboratory results, this patient is most likely in the acute or early stage of HIV infection, also known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS). The presence of fever, malaise, diarrhea, and enlarged lymph nodes are common symptoms of ARS, which typically occurs 2-4 weeks after HIV infection. The CD4+ count of 650/mm3 is still within the normal range, which is also consistent with early infection.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection, likely Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The most appropriate drug for managing this condition is azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic. \n\nThe mechanism of action of azithromycin involves binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial cell, inhibiting protein synthesis by blocking the translocation step, where the ribosome moves along the mRNA. This results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and ultimately leads to the death of the bacterial cells.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody is the gp120 protein, which is part of the HIV envelope. gp120 is a key component of the HIV envelope and is recognized by many neutralizing antibodies produced during natural infection. It's a primary target for many HIV vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts due to its critical role in viral entry into host cells.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation and biopsy findings are suggestive of a fungal infection. Given the presence of septate hyphae that branch at acute angles, the most likely causal organism is Aspergillus. In an HIV-positive patient with a compromised immune system, invasive aspergillosis is a concern, and the fibrocavitary lesion in the lung is consistent with this diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, which includes zidovudine, puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, specifically neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased neutrophil counts. This combination may increase the risk of neutropenia, which can predispose the patient to infections. Close monitoring of his complete blood count is necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn, the most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection would be the HIV DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or HIV RNA assay, not an antibody test. This is because antibody tests detect maternal antibodies that can be passed to the baby, which may not accurately reflect the baby's HIV status. The HIV DNA PCR or RNA assay can directly detect the virus in the baby's blood and is typically performed at 14-21 days of life, with repeat testing at 1-2 months and 4-6 months to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "This is a complex situation involving patient confidentiality and public health concerns. The most appropriate next step would be to counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk of infection. However, the physician should also inform the patient about the laws and regulations regarding HIV disclosure and confidentiality in their jurisdiction.\n\nIn many places, healthcare providers are required to report new HIV diagnoses to public health authorities, who may then contact the patient's partners. The physician should explain this to the patient and encourage him to disclose his status to his wife voluntarily.\n\nIf the patient still refuses to disclose, the physician should consult with their local health department and/or seek legal advice to determine the best course of action, balancing patient confidentiality with the need to protect the patient's wife and prevent further transmission. The physician's primary concern should be the health and well-being of all parties involved.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of her condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nGiven her HIV status, one potential cause to consider is a medication side effect, as some antiretroviral medications can increase the risk of pancreatitis. However, without knowing the specific HIV medications she is taking, it's difficult to say for certain. Other potential causes, such as gallstones or alcohol use, should also be considered, although her moderate social alcohol use and normal gallbladder on CT make these less likely. Further evaluation of her medication list and additional history may help determine the underlying cause of her pancreatitis.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for the replication of retroviruses like HIV. \n\nThe biological process most likely disrupted by zidovudine's action mechanism is the reverse transcription of the HIV genome from RNA into DNA, which is necessary for the virus to integrate into the host cell's genome and replicate.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation plays a role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression. In latent HIV-1 infection, the viral genome is methylated, which helps to suppress viral transcription and maintain latency. In contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with decreased methylation of the viral genome, allowing for increased viral transcription and replication.\n\nStudies have also shown that host cell DNA methylation profiles are altered in HIV-1 infection, with changes in methylation patterns affecting immune response genes, cellular signaling pathways, and cellular differentiation. These changes can contribute to immune dysfunction and disease progression.\n\nHowever, the specific DNA methylation profiles in latent versus active HIV-1 infection are complex and not fully understood, and more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
