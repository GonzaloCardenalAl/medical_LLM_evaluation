    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, antiretroviral treatment for HIV was still in its early stages. At that time, the primary drugs used were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Based on historical treatment guidelines and usage, the following five antiretroviral drugs were likely among the most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) - although it was approved in 1994 in the US, it might have been used in some clinical trials or compassionate use programs in 1990.\n5. It's challenging to determine a fifth drug with certainty, as the antiretroviral landscape was limited in 1990. However, Lamivudine (3TC) was not approved until 1995, so it's unlikely to be the fifth option.\n\nPlease note that the exact ranking and usage of these drugs might vary depending on the specific context, such as clinical trials, compassionate use programs, or individual physician preferences. If you need more precise information, I recommend consulting historical treatment guidelines or medical literature from that time period.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in 2010, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population. However, with the advancement of antiretroviral therapy, many women with HIV are now able to have healthy pregnancies. I'd recommend checking the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or specific studies from that time for exact numbers, as I don't have the most up-to-date or precise information on this topic.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, approximately 20-30% of patients with HIV report missing their antiretroviral therapy (ART) at least once a month. However, please note that self-reported adherence can be subject to biases and may not accurately reflect actual adherence behavior.",

  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To answer this question accurately, I would need to refer to specific epidemiological studies or data from Switzerland focusing on the HIV-positive population from 1990 to 2010. The progression of HIV, as indicated by the decline in CD4 cell count, can be influenced by various factors including age at diagnosis, viral load, access to and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle factors, and the presence of co-infections.\n\nGenerally, the rate of CD4 cell count decline can vary significantly among individuals due to these factors. Younger individuals, particularly those diagnosed before the age of 20, might have different outcomes compared to those diagnosed later in life due to differences in behavior, access to care, and potentially the strain of the virus.\n\nWithout specific data or studies from Switzerland during that period, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it's known that the introduction and widespread use of ART have significantly slowed the progression of HIV to AIDS, regardless of age at diagnosis. If you're looking for precise information on this topic, I recommend consulting the Swiss HIV Cohort Study or similar research databases for more detailed insights.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
