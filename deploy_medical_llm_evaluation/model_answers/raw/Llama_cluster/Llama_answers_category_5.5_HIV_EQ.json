    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and brain biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus, which affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes is consistent with PML. The patient's history of skipping antiretroviral medications, leading to a low CD4 count, has likely increased her risk of developing PML. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a different condition, and while it can cause cognitive and motor symptoms, the brain biopsy results and imaging findings in this case are more suggestive of PML.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, and considering the mention of pancreatitis as an adverse effect, it's likely that the patient is at risk for pancreatitis due to the medications, particularly didanosine or stavudine which are known to cause pancreatitis, but not the ones listed. However, among the listed medications, none directly point towards pancreatitis. \n\nBut since the question hints towards pancreatitis, and considering the medications, I would say the patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow suppression, as well as potential lipodystrophy syndrome, which are common side effects of the prescribed antiretroviral therapy, especially with the use of zidovudine and indinavir. \n\nAdditionally, indinavir is known for causing nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). Lamivudine and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia or neutropenia. \n\nIt's crucial to monitor the patient closely for these potential side effects.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is not Glioblastoma, but rather a condition more commonly associated with immunocompromised states. The positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, along with the clinical presentation and imaging findings, suggests Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is more common in individuals with severe immunosuppression, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus is often associated with PCNSL in this context.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and chest x-ray findings, the most likely causal organism is likely a common bacterial pathogen. Although there was a recent patient with similar symptoms caused by Staphylococcus aureus, this does not necessarily mean the same organism is responsible for this patient's illness.\n\nIn a patient with HIV on effective antiretroviral therapy (as suggested by a CD4 count of 520/mm\u00b3) and presenting with community-acquired pneumonia, the most likely causal organisms are similar to those in the general population, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus can also be a cause, especially if there's a suggestion of influenza or viral pneumonia preceding the bacterial infection, but it's not the first suspect without additional clues like skin lesions or recent influenza-like illness. \n\nWithout more specific information (like Gram stain results from sputum or blood cultures), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact organism, but common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens should be considered first.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Mycobacterium avium. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, along with the biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils in the skin lesion, the most likely causal organism is Bartonella henselae. This is consistent with Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a condition that can present similarly to the described case, particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those with advanced HIV infection. BA is known to cause skin lesions, systemic symptoms, and can involve the liver, as suggested by the hepatomegaly and the intrahepatic lesion. While Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) can also cause systemic illness in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts, the specific findings of vascular proliferation and neutrophils in the skin lesion biopsy are more characteristic of BA.",

Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), it's unlikely that Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most likely diagnosis. IBS typically does not cause fever or significant weight loss and is a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\nThe patient's low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) suggests a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The symptoms presented could be indicative of an opportunistic infection or a condition related to his immunocompromised state, such as cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, or another gastrointestinal infection.\n\nIt's crucial to await the stool microscopy results and consider further diagnostic testing (e.g., stool cultures, endoscopy) to determine the cause of his symptoms. Additionally, addressing his non-compliance with ART and managing his HIV infection is essential.",

    "question": "A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. Analysis of the pleural fluid shows an effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, an LDH of 500 U/L, and high adenosine deaminase. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with lung cancer. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is not lung cancer, despite the recent similar case. The key findings here include:\n\n1. **Lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion** with high protein and LDH levels, and particularly the **high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels** in the pleural fluid. High ADA levels are strongly suggestive of tuberculous pleurisy, especially in the context of a patient with a compromised immune system due to HIV infection.\n\n2. **Hilar lymphadenopathy** seen on the chest X-ray, which can be associated with tuberculosis (TB), especially in immunocompromised patients.\n\n3. The patient's **history of HIV infection** with a relatively low CD4 count (240/mm^3), which increases the risk for opportunistic infections, including TB.\n\n4. **Social and environmental factors**, such as living in a homeless shelter, increase the risk of exposure to TB.\n\n5. The patient's **symptoms** of fever, night sweats (indicated by waking up to a wet pillow), productive cough, and weight loss (suggested by decreased hunger) are classic for pulmonary TB.\n\nWhile lung cancer is a concern in smokers, the specific combination of findings in this patient, especially the high ADA levels in the pleural fluid and the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy, points more towards tuberculosis as the most likely diagnosis. It's essential to confirm with appropriate diagnostic tests, including microbiological examination of sputum or pleural fluid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Entamoeba histolytica. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, travel history, and laboratory findings (oocysts on modified acid-fast stain), the most likely causal organism is Cryptosporidium. This is because Cryptosporidium oocysts are typically identified using a modified acid-fast stain, and the patient's presentation of watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, anorexia, and nausea, especially in the context of a low CD4 count and recent travel history, is consistent with cryptosporidiosis. Entamoeba histolytica, on the other hand, would typically be identified by seeing trophozoites or cysts in stool and might present with more bloody diarrhea.",

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and the number of false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True positives (patients with AIDS who test positive) = 240\n- False positives (patients without AIDS who test positive) = 5\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nFirst, calculate the number of false negatives:\nFalse negatives = Total patients with AIDS - True positives = 250 - 240 = 10\n\nNext, calculate the number of true negatives:\nTrue negatives = Total patients without AIDS - False positives = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the proportion of patients with a negative test result who are truly free of the disease:\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nNPV = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.08%. This means that about 96.08% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",

An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as vascular dementia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The information provided does not support a diagnosis of vascular dementia as the most likely cause. The patient's presentation, including progressive cognitive decline, right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, along with a very low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, suggests a condition related to his advanced HIV disease.\n\nGiven the patient's severe immunocompromised state (CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL) and the presence of neurological symptoms and white matter lesions on MRI, a more likely diagnosis would be HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) or, more specifically, given the severity, HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the presence of white matter lesions could also suggest other opportunistic infections or conditions such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), especially in the context of severe immunosuppression.

Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "The information provided does not support a diagnosis of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum as the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. The patient's presentation of cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, fever, and a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field on chest x-ray, along with crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base, is more suggestive of a respiratory infection, likely pneumonia.\n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV infection with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 280/mm^3, smoking history, and alcohol use, he is at increased risk for various types of infections, including bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, or opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), especially if his HIV is not well-managed due to non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy.\n\nThe symptoms and findings do not align with pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, which typically presents with dysphagia, regurgitation of food, and sometimes aspiration pneumonia, rather than the primary symptoms of cough, fever, and night sweats described in this case. A thorough diagnostic workup, including blood cultures, sputum analysis, and possibly further imaging or bronchoscopy, would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the pneumonia and guide appropriate treatment.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, presentation with focal neurological deficits (weakness of one hand), and fever, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis or a focal brain infection such as toxoplasmosis, but also considering progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) given the immunocompromised state. However, the use of itraconazole as an empiric treatment does not align with the initial management of these conditions. \n\nThe next best step would be to urgently perform a thorough diagnostic workup, including:\n1. **Neuroimaging** (preferably MRI of the brain) to identify any focal lesions or abnormalities.\n2. **Lumbar puncture** for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including culture, PCR for opportunistic pathogens (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, JC virus for PML), and crypto antigen.\n3. **Review and optimization of the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART)** to improve his CD4 count and immune status, considering his reported inconsistent adherence.\n4. **Empiric treatment** should be based on the most likely diagnoses and could include antimicrobials effective against toxoplasmosis (e.g., sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine) or cryptococcosis (e.g., amphotericin B), but this should be guided by clinical suspicion and diagnostic findings rather than itraconazole as a first-line empiric choice.\n\nItraconazole is used for certain fungal infections, but it's not the initial empiric treatment for the differential diagnoses suggested by this patient's presentation. Each potential diagnosis has specific treatments, and a targeted approach based on diagnostic findings is more appropriate.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At this prenatal visit, the following tests should be done:\n\n1. **Confirmation of pregnancy**: Urine or serum beta-hCG to confirm pregnancy.\n2. **Blood type and Rh factor**: To determine if the patient is Rh-positive or Rh-negative.\n3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n4. **Serum TSH**: To assess thyroid function, as your hospital has been doing this routinely.\n5. **Rubella immunity**: To confirm immunity to rubella (German measles).\n6. **Varicella immunity**: To confirm immunity to varicella (chickenpox).\n7. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**: To screen for hepatitis B infection.\n8. **HIV testing**: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, it's recommended to re-test during pregnancy.\n9. **Syphilis screening**: To screen for syphilis infection.\n10. **Urine culture**: To check for asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n11. **Pap smear**: If due for routine cervical cancer screening.\n12. **CMV serology**: As per your hospital's routine.\n\nNote: HSV-2 PCR is not typically done as a routine prenatal test, but rather for symptomatic patients or those with a history of genital herpes. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing may be considered based on individual risk factors, but are not universally recommended at this gestational age.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis (BA), which is caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of BA.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is azithromycin or doxycycline. However, given the hospital's experience with Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, this combination can also be used as an alternative treatment for BA, although it's not the first-line choice.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and symptoms suggest advanced HIV disease, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as possible.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The description of the lesions and the response to acetic acid is consistent with condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts. The etiology of these lesions is indeed Human Papillomavirus (HPV), but not exclusively types 16 and 18. Genital warts are most commonly caused by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11, which are different from the high-risk types 16 and 18 that are associated with cervical and anal cancers. The patient's HIV status may increase his susceptibility to HPV infection and its manifestations.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), given the significant increase in CD4+ T cell count and decrease in HIV RNA. The most appropriate initial step in treatment would be to continue the current antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol) and the antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine), and consider adding corticosteroids to manage the IRIS symptoms, rather than changing the antitubercular therapy. \n\nNote: The addition of streptomycin is not necessary at this point, as the patient has already shown improvement with the initial 4-drug regimen and the current symptoms are more likely related to IRIS than to tuberculosis treatment failure.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), not Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. HIVAN is a common cause of kidney disease in patients with HIV, particularly those of African descent, and is characterized by proteinuria and kidney dysfunction. The presence of proteinuria and edema in this patient, along with his HIV status, makes HIVAN a more likely diagnosis. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is also possible, but HIVAN is a more likely consideration given the patient's HIV status and clinical presentation.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of infective endocarditis, given the heart murmur, fever, and history of HIV. However, the widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray could also suggest other conditions such as a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe use of Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is not the most reliable assay for this clinical profile, as it is primarily used to diagnose acute rheumatic fever, which is caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, blood cultures and echocardiography (preferably transesophageal echocardiography) would be more appropriate. Additionally, given the patient's HIV status and symptoms, other tests such as complete blood count, liver function tests, and HIV viral load may also be helpful.\n\nFor mediastinal widening, a CT scan of the chest with contrast would provide more information than a plain X-ray.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the pupil reaction to light, which is preserved when a pen tip is advanced closer to the face (a test for pupillary light reflex), and the loss of balance when standing with eyes closed (a test for proprioception), may indicate a neurological issue, but it's not clear how this relates to the primary complaint of shortness of breath. Further evaluation would be needed to determine the cause of these findings.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of chemotherapy, particularly in patients with bulky disease like Burkitt's lymphoma.\n\nThe therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities, specifically the hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury, is not Allopurinol 300 mg/day alone. Allopurinol can help reduce uric acid production, but it is not sufficient in this case, given the severe hyperuricemia and kidney injury.\n\nThe recommended therapy for TLS includes:\n\n1. Aggressive hydration to help flush out uric acid and other metabolites.\n2. Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, which breaks down uric acid into allantoin, a more soluble compound that can be easily excreted by the kidneys.\n3. Alkalinization of the urine with bicarbonate or acetazolamide to increase uric acid solubility.\n4. Monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia.\n\nRasburicase is the preferred agent for managing hyperuricemia in TLS, as it is more effective than Allopurinol in rapidly reducing uric acid levels. The hospital's protocol should be updated to reflect this.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
