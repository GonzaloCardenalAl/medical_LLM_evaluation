    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. Based on historical data, the following five antiretroviral drugs were likely among the most frequently administered in Switzerland during that time:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was not yet widely available, so it's less likely, but possible \n5. It's unlikely a fifth antiretroviral was commonly used, as the options were limited. However, some patients may have received Ribavirin, although its use was not widespread.\n\nPlease note that the exact ranking and usage may vary depending on the specific clinic, hospital, or region within Switzerland. Additionally, treatment guidelines and availability of medications may have changed throughout the year.",

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To answer this question accurately, I would need to refer to specific epidemiological studies or research data focusing on the Swiss population with HIV, diagnosed between 1990 and 2010, and with an initial CD4 count above 300. \n\nThe factors influencing the rate of CD4 decline can include age at diagnosis, viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle factors, and the presence of co-infections or co-morbidities. Generally, younger individuals tend to have healthier immune systems, which might influence the progression of HIV. However, without specific data or studies addressing this exact question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding the difference in the time taken for the CD4 count to drop below 200 in individuals tested before or after the age of 20 in Switzerland during that period.\n\nIf such specific studies or data exist, they would likely be found in peer-reviewed journals or reports from Swiss health authorities and would provide the most accurate and reliable information on this topic.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
