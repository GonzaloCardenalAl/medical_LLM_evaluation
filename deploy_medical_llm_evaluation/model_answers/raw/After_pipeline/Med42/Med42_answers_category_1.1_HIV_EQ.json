    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodef iciency Virus) diagnosis involves a combination of screening tests and confirmatory tests, following these steps:\n\n1. Initial Screening: Typically, healthcare providers use rapid, point-of-care antigen-antibody combination tests (often fourth-generation tests) or separate rapid antibody tests (usually 3rd generation, though less preferred for first-line in modern practice due to slight delay in antibody detection compared to antigen-antibody combo) from venous blood or, in some cases, fingerstick blood or oral fluid. These are meant as preliminary tests, not definitive.\n\nExamples of these initial screening tests include Alere Determine, Bio-Rad Geenius, or Abbott Architect (for antigen-antibody combo tests) or, for antibody-only tests, OraQuick ADVANCE or SD Bioline HIV-1/2 3.0. These screening tests target either antibodies against HIV (formed as immune response) or both antibodies and p24 antigen (a viral core protein produced during acute HIV infection\u2014before antibody formation). \n\n2. Confirmation for Reactive Screens: If the screening test result is positive (reactive), laboratory-based confirmatory tests are performed using Western blot or an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). These tests are highly specific, detecting the presence of antibodies against specific HIV-1 proteins (e.g., p17, p24, gp41, or gp120).\n   \nIn some countries and settings, especially high-resource ones, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), like PCR, can be used as confirmatory or as differentiator tests\u2014if needed\u2014to distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2 infections.\n\n3. Acute HIV Infection Diagnosis: In cases where suspicion for very recent infection exists (often indicated by negative or indeterminate antibody-based results alongside symptoms suggestive of acute retroviral syndrome [ARS]), HIV NAATs or antigen-antibody combo tests are used. Acute infection can't be confirmed by classic antibody-based methods, as there's a \"window period\" during which antibodies aren't yet detectable. Antigen-antibody combo tests can identify p24 antigen prior to antibodies, while PCR amplifies HIV RNA directly.\n   \nKeep in mind that different countries or regions may have standardized HIV testing algorithms based on resource availability and prevalence. \n\nThis answer focuses primarily on antibody-based or antigen-antibody combination tests, as they're the more commonly used first-step options, but note the increasing role of NAATs for diagnosis or differentiation, especially in",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection progresses through distinct clinical stages. Here's a detailed outline, based on current medical understanding and WHO/CDC guidelines:\n\n1. **Acute HIV Infection** (typically within 1-4 weeks after exposure):\n   - High levels of HIV virus in blood (viremia)\n   - May present with flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, muscle/joint pain, rash, headache) or remain asymptomatic\n   - Antibody tests (4th generation or rapid antigen-Ab combo tests) might initially be negative; however, nucleic acid tests (NATs) such as PCR can detect viral RNA early\n   - This stage is highly infectious due to extremely high viral load\n\n2. **Clinical Latency (Asymptomatic HIV or Chronic HIV infection)** (months to years after acute infection):\n   - Virus replication slows, and immune response develops antibodies (seroconversion)\n   - Most individuals remain asymptomatic or experience minimal symptoms\n   - CD4 T-lymphocyte count declines gradually but often stays above 500 cells/\u03bcl\n   - Viral load may fluctuate, with periods of relative suppression but persistent replication\n   - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is recommended immediately upon diagnosis to prevent progression and limit transmission\n\n3. **Symptomatic HIV (Pre-AIDS)**:\n   - CD4 count starts to decline significantly (<500 cells/\u03bcl)\n   - Recurrent opportunistic infections (OIs), persistent swollen lymph nodes, oral ulcers, unexplained weight loss, or chronic diarrhea\n   - Neurological symptoms like neuropathy or mild cognitive impairment may appear\n   - Viral load often increases\n   - ART should be continued or initiated if not already implemented\n\n4. **Advanced HIV (AIDS - Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**:\n   - CD4 count severely depleted (<200 cells/\u03bcl)\n   - Severe life-threatening opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis pneumonia, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, toxoplasmosis)\n   - Cancer risk increased (Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma)\n   - Neurological complications (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, CNS toxoplasmosis)\n   - ART is crucial for survival; treatment adherence must be emphasized\n\nIt's important to note that modern antiretroviral treatments have significantly improved outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, and many patients may live",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

Through contaminated needle sharing:\n- Sharing injecting drug equipment, like syringes, needles, or other items for preparing drugs, among users when at least one user is HIV-positive. A tiny amount of infected blood remaining in the needle or on other shared equipment can transmit HIV.\n\n  3. Mother-to-child transmission:\n- From an HIV-infected mother to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Antiretroviral therapy given to both mother and child reduces transmission risk significantly.\n\n  4. Blood transfusions and organ transplants (rare):\n- Although very rare in developed nations with stringent screening processes, HIV can be transmitted through transfusion of contaminated blood or transplantation of organs from an HIV-positive donor.\n\n- Note: There is no transmission through casual contact such as hugging, kissing, or sharing food and drinks, or through insect bites or contact with sweat.\n\nCurrent information relies on evidence from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO); however, consult the sources below for the most up-to-date, detailed information and guidance.\n- CDC: HIV Basics | Transmission\n- WHO: HIV/AIDS, transmission\n\nRemember, this answer represents current scientific consensus and is subject to revision as our understanding evolves based on further research and evidence.",

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "1. Chronic liver disease (hepatitis B or C co-infection): Due to shared transmission routes, a significant proportion of HIV-positive individuals also have hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). This leads to elevated rates of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in this population.\n\n2. Cardiovascular disease: HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can contribute to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation, increasing cardiovascular risk. People living with HIV experience higher rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease compared to the general population.\n\n3. Chronic kidney disease: HIV itself and some antiretroviral medications, particularly tenofovir, can cause kidney damage or worsen pre-existing renal disease. Hypertension and diabetes, also common in this population, further exacerbate kidney disease risk.\n\n4. Mental health disorders: People living with HIV have higher rates of depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders due to the biological effects of HIV on the brain, combined with social stigma, trauma, and lifestyle factors.\n\n5. Non-AIDS-defining cancers: HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk of developing several cancers, including lung, liver, anal, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Human papillomavirus (HPV) co-infection, smoking, and immune suppression contribute to this elevated risk.\n\n6. Osteoporosis and bone fractures: HIV infection, certain antiretroviral medications, and aging can lead to decreased bone mineral density, placing this population at higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures.\n\n7. Neurocognitive impairment: Chronic HIV infection can result in cognitive impairment, including executive function and memory deficits, even in individuals with well-controlled viremia on ART.\n\n8. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome: HIV infection and some antiretrovirals, such as protease inhibitors, can promote insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, increasing the risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n9. Bone marrow dysfunction and anemia: HIV infection and ART can cause bone marrow suppression, which may result in anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. This is more common among older HIV patients and those with more advanced immunosuppression.\n\n10. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Like the general population, HIV-positive individuals are increasingly affected by metabolic conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This issue is compounded by lipodystrophy syndrome,",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "1. Consistent and correct use of condoms: Latex or polyurethane condoms are highly effective barriers against HIV transmission during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. However, they are not 100% foolproof and require proper application; still, as a widely accessible method, they significantly reduce risk when used correctly.\n2. PreP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis): This involves taking daily oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed, specifically Truvada\u00ae or Descovy\u00ae, by HIV-negative individuals who are at significant risk of exposure (e.g., through sex with an HIV-positive partner or engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors). When taken as directed, PreP is almost 99% effective in preventing HIV acquisition for these individuals.\n3. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): If someone believes they may have been exposed to HIV, taking emergency ART for 28 days within 72 hours of the potential exposure can help prevent infection. However, this is not a substitute for consistent prevention methods and should be used only in emergency situations.\n4. Male circumcision: In high-prevalence, heterosexual transmission settings (such as parts of Africa), male circumcision has been shown to reduce HIV transmission from women to men by approximately 60%.\n5. Harm reduction strategies: For injecting drug users, supplying clean needles and syringes, as well as safe disposal equipment, has been shown to reduce HIV transmission via shared equipment.\n6. Treatment as prevention: When HIV-positive individuals adhere to ART and achieve sustained undetectable viral load, they become essentially non-infectious\u2014that is, they will not transmit HIV through sex. This approach, however, is contingent on continuous, unbroken treatment.\n7. Screening and disclosure: Regular HIV testing for high-risk populations, followed by disclosure of one's HIV status to partners and potential contacts, can lead to safer behaviors and reduced transmission.\n8. Comprehensive sex education: Educating people early in life about safer sex practices, such as condom use, can lay a foundation for healthier habits and better decision-making as they mature sexually.\n\nKeep in mind that no prevention method is perfect; for maximal protection, it's best to use multiple strategies, such as condoms and PreP, when necessary. Consult reputable sources like CDC, WHO, or UNAIDS for up-to-date prevention recommendations.\n\n",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "In the context of HIV treatment, ART stands for Antiretroviral Therapy. For optimal effectiveness and suppression of the virus, ART medications are prescribed to be taken consistently every day at specified times, without interruption.\n1. Standard regimen: Most ART combinations consist of 2-3 different antiretroviral drugs from at least two drug classes. Patients must take all prescribed medications once (QD) or twice daily (BID) exactly as directed, ideally at the same times each day to maintain steady blood levels and prevent viral resistance [1].\n2. Adherence: Missing doses or irregular dosing is discouraged, as this can lead to reduced efficacy, viral rebound, emergence of resistant viral strains, or treatment failure [2]. An adherence rate of 95% or higher is critical for achieving sustained virological suppression (<50 copies of HIV RNA/mL in blood) [3].\n3. Special considerations: Some newer medications, such as long-acting injectables (e.g., Cabotegravir + Rilpivirine), offer an alternative dosing schedule (every 1 or 2 months) for stable patients [4].\n\nIn summary, for oral ART regimens, medications should be taken daily, without interruption, at consistent times. Failure to adhere to the prescribed schedule can compromise treatment outcomes.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Department of Health and Human Services. (2021).

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Preventing perinatal transmission (also known as mother-to-child transmission, MTCT) of HIV is highly effective with proper antiretroviral therapy (ART) and obstetric management. Here are the key strategies:\n1. **HIV testing during pregnancy**: Universal HIV testing early in antenatal care ensures that HIV-infected women are identified and linked to treatment.\n2. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for the mother**: Providing ART to HIV-positive pregnant women, regardless of CD4 count, suppresses viral load, minimizing transmission risk. Ideally, treatment should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis and continue lifelong.\n3. **Optimized ART regimens**: Use of recommended, simplified ART regimens (e.g., two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one integrase inhibitor or boosted protease inhibitor) ensures maximal viral suppression.\n4. **Adherence support**: Healthcare providers must educate patients on the importance of medication adherence, monitor adherence, and provide support mechanisms to facilitate consistent medication use.\n5. **Elective cesarean section (optional)**: For women not virally suppressed near term (e.g., HIV viral load >1,000 copies/ml), elective cesarean delivery can further reduce transmission risk.\n6. **Prophylaxis for the newborn**: Post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant using antiretrovirals, typically for 4-6 weeks after birth, adds a layer of protection against MTCT.\n7. **Breastfeeding counseling**: In high-income countries, HIV-infected women are advised against breastfeeding, as formula feeding eliminates transmission risk during this period. However, in resource-limited settings or areas where clean water access is scarce, WHO guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months while maintaining maternal ART, as this approach reduces mortality and morbidity overall.\n8. **Monitoring and follow-up**: Close follow-up of mother and baby, including serial HIV testing of the infant and continued maternal care, ensures that both receive ongoing ART as needed and any complications are addressed promptly.\n\nImplementing these evidence-based measures can reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to less than 1%, making vertical transmission a rare event in well-resourced settings.",

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "The primary cell types targeted by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are CD4+ T lymphocytes (also called T-helper cells) and macrophages. Both of these cell types have CD4 receptors on their surface, which HIV utilizes for attachment and entry.\n\n1. CD4+ T-helper cells (TH cells): These cells play a crucial role in coordinating adaptive immune responses. HIV's infection of CD4+ T cells drastically diminishes their numbers, leading to impaired immune function\u2014a hallmark of AIDS. Specifically, HIV targets central memory T cells (TCM) and effector memory T cells (TEM) within this subset, impacting both recent antigen-responding cells (TEM) and long-lived memory cells primed for rapid response (TCM) against subsequent infections by the same pathogen.\n\n2. Macrophages: These cells are part of the innate immune system and serve as antigen-presenting cells. Macrophages can act as long-lived reservoirs for latent HIV, allowing for persistent viral replication even in the face of antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV infection of macrophages occurs in various tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), lymph nodes, gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and lungs, contributing to the systemic nature of HIV infection.\n\nOther cell types that can be infected with HIV, albeit less efficiently, include dendritic cells and astrocytes, although these infections occur secondary to lymphocyte and macrophage infection. The primary infection remains focused on CD4+ T cells and macrophages due to the requirement for CD4 receptors and co-receptors such as CCR5 (or, in some cases, CXCR4) for entry. \n\nIt's important to bear in mind that although other cell types can be permissive to infection under certain in vitro or ex vivo conditions, CD4+ T cells and macrophages are the main host cells driving pathological consequences in HIV-infected individuals.",

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) are interconnected but distinct entities in the context of infection and disease progression. Here's the key difference:\n\n1. HIV is the virus: It's a retrovirus that targets and gradually destroys CD4+ T cells, also known as T-lymphocytes or helper T cells, which are crucial for the immune system's ability to fight off infections. HIV transmission occurs through bodily fluids (e.g., blood, semen, breast milk, vaginal or rectal fluids) during unprotected sex, contaminated needles, or vertical transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n2. AIDS is the syndrome: It's the advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by severe immunosuppression. AIDS develops when HIV has drastically reduced CD4+ cell counts (usually below 200 cells per microliter; a normal count is 500-1,500), leading to an assortment of opportunistic infections (OI) and cancers (not typically seen in healthy individuals). Common OIs associated with AIDS include tuberculosis, pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and severe forms of herpes simplex. AIDS-defining cancers include Kaposi's sarcoma and certain lymphomas.\n\nTo summarize:\n- HIV infects and depletes CD4+ cells, weakening immunity.\n- AIDS represents the final, severe stage of HIV disease progression, marked by low CD4+ counts and susceptibility to opportunistic infections or cancers due to profound immunosuppression.\n\nToday, antiretroviral therapy can prevent or halt disease progression to AIDS, extending life expectancy and quality of life for people living with HIV. However, if left untreated, HIV typically advances to AIDS over time (usually within 10 years).",

Through casual contact: HIV is not spread via non-intimate, everyday interactions like hugging, shaking hands, sharing food, or sitting next to an infected person. Casual contact does not pose a risk of transmission.\n2. Via airborne or waterborne routes: HIV is not contagious through air (coughing, sneezing) or water (swimming pools, shared drinking water). Transmission occurs only through direct contact with an infected individual's blood, semen, vaginal or rectal fluids, or breast milk.\n3. Insect bites: Insects (mosquitoes, ticks, or any others) are not capable of transmitting HIV.\n4. Social kissing: While saliva can contain HIV, oral transmission risk through social kissing is negligible, as there is not enough virus present in saliva to establish infection in a healthy person.\n5. Sharing personal care items: Sharing non-sterilized personal care items (e.g., razors, toothbrushes) is not a significant mode of transmission due to the low viral survival outside bodily fluids and the low likelihood of deep cuts or open wounds with sufficient exposure to blood.\n6. Food preparation: HIV-infected individuals can safely prepare food for others, as HIV cannot survive heating, and handling food without open wounds or blood exposure poses no risk.\n7. Toilet seats or surfaces: Contact with toilet seats, sinks, or other surfaces touched by an HIV-infected person does not lead to transmission, as HIV is not viable outside bodily fluids.\n8. Donated organs (screened properly): Organ transplantations from deceased donors are not a transmission route because donated organs undergo rigorous viral screening processes, ensuring organ recipients are protected from HIV.\n9.

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The transition from latent HIV to active replication, also referred as \"activation\" or \"reactivation\" of latent reservoirs, is an area of ongoing research, though here's the current understanding based on scientific literature:\n1. Immune quiescence disruption: Latent HIV resides within long-lived memory CD4+ T cells in a transcriptionally silent state. When these cells encounter antigen or immune activation signals (such as those from concurrent infections, inflammation, or autoimmune responses), it triggers intracellular signaling pathways that override latency.\n2. NF-\u03baB pathway activation: The NF-\u03baB transcription factor, a key regulator of gene expression, is crucial for HIV transcriptional activation from latency. When NF-\u03baB is activated, usually in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, it translocates to the nucleus and induces HIV gene expression.\n3. Chromatin remodeling: The HIV provirus is embedded within repressive chromatin structures in latently infected cells. Activating signals induce histone modifications, such as acetylation or methylation, or recruitment of chromatin remodelers to shift chromatin into a permissive state, enabling gene transcription.\n4. Epigenetic regulation: DNA methylation and histone modifications help maintain latency, while their reversal aids reactivation. TET2 (ten-eleven translocation 2) demethylates 5-methylcytosine and fosters HIV reactivation by opening chromatin.\n5. IL-7 signaling: Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a homeostatic cytokine that normally maintains the viability of T cells. In HIV latently infected cells, IL-7 stimulation activates HIV expression, likely through its effects on STAT5 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 5) pathway, which phosphorylates and activates key transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB.\n6. Cell proliferation and differentiation: When memory CD4+ T cells are driven to proliferate or differentiate into effector T cells, they can switch from latent to active HIV replication as a consequence of changes in transcriptional machinery and cellular context.\n7. Pharmacological induction: Certain drugs like HDAC inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat), PKC agonists (e.g., bryostatin), or Toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., TLR9) can reactivate latent HIV in vitro and in some clinical trials. However, there is ongoing debate regarding their effectiveness, safety, and utility in curing HIV.\n\nKeep in mind that the study of HIV latency is a",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
