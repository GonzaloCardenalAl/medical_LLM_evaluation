    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the lumbar puncture findings (elevated opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein, and low glucose) and the initiation of IV amphotericin B and oral flucytosine, the primary diagnosis appears to be cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with severely depressed CD4 counts (like 47 in this case).\n \nIn addition to antifungal therapy, the following acute treatments should be considered:\n\n1. Management of intracranial pressure: Cryptococcal meningitis can lead to increased intracranial pressure, which can cause significant neurological deterioration. Serial lumbar punctures for therapeutic CSF drainage (removing 20-30 mL each) may help alleviate pressure, as guided by opening pressures and clinical status. Monitoring and potential management of the patient in a neurointensive care unit might be necessary.\n2. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) optimization: As an AIDS patient with a CD4 count of 47, she is likely not optimally treated for her HIV infection. If she's not currently on ART or if her regimen needs adjustment, consult with an HIV specialist to expedite treatment modification.\n3. Corticosteroids for paradoxical IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome) prevention: Though controversial, some guidelines suggest corticosteroid prophylaxis in AIDS patients starting ART along with treatment for opportunistic infections (like cryptococcal meningitis) to prevent severe IRIS reactions, which can worsen outcomes.\n4. Supportive care and monitoring: The patient's severe immunosuppression predisposes her to other opportunistic infections, so she'll require broad monitoring for co-infections or complications, such as pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, or CMV infection. Regular vital sign monitoring, electrolyte balance assessment, and renal function monitoring are crucial due to her risk of volume overload from IV fluids and the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B. Close neurologic monitoring, including frequent Glasgow Coma Scale assessments, is also imperative.\n5. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is warranted to ensure optimal management according to current guidelines and individual patient factors. \n\nPlease note that although IRIS prophylaxis with corticosteroids is mentioned, some guidelines and more recent literature do not universally recommend steroids for IRIS prevention in all HIV/AIDS patients starting ART concurrently with treatment for acute opportunistic infections; the decision should be based on the specific",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening test, we'll use the provided data from the study.\n- True Negatives (TN): Patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening, which is 250 (control group, no AIDS) minus 5 (false positives) = 245.\n- False Negatives (FN): Patients with confirmed AIDS who tested negative on the screening, which in this case is 0, since 240 out of 250 AIDS patients tested positive (only 10 didn't, but for our NPV calculation, we assume all non-mentioned-in-positives as our actual \"negative tests in AIDS group\" here are 250 - 240 = 10 are treated as false negatives for this context of NPV, though ideally, it'd be explicit false negatives in a test design, but here it's 240/250 hits as positives leaves 10 as not catching on test side as 'negatives' in AIDS group for NPV purposes: 10 for this example's calculation). Keep in mind this idealization (assuming all non-positives as false negatives in AIDS group for NPV) could introduce slight imprecision but is done for simplicity based on the text given, as there's no explicitly separated \"false negative\" count provided.\n- The total of individuals who do not have AIDS (true negatives plus false positives from control group) = 245 TN (correctly identified as AIDS negative) + 5 FP (incorrectly identified as AIDS positive, though they don't have AIDS) = 250.\n  \nNow, we can calculate Negative Predictive Value (NPV):\nNPV = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n       = 245 / (245 + 10)\n       \u2248 0.961 (rounded to three decimal places)\n       \nThus, in this novel AIDS screening test, approximately 96.1% of patients who test negative can be considered as truly not having AIDS, according to the NPV derived from the given trial data. Keep in mind, however, that using all \"non-positives\" from the AIDS group as false negatives (due to no specified FN value) introduces a minor approximation, though it doesn't drastically alter the NPV interpretation in this context.

    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the presented case:\n1. Acute priority: The patient's high fever (102.6\u00b0F) needs immediate attention as a potential sign of infection, especially in an immunocompromised state like HIV with a low CD4 count (77/mm^3). Initiate empiric antimicrobial coverage after drawing blood cultures, considering common pathogens in HIV-positive patients (e.g., pneumococci, staphylococci) and potential opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, though fever's prominence here points more toward bacterial or typical fungal infections over toxoplasma).\n2. Neurological evaluation: Given the right hand weakness and localized decreased muscle strength (3/5 distally), a suspected acute cerebrovascular event (stroke) or CNS abscess, particularly in light of his fever, should be evaluated. Order emergent non-contrast head CT to rule out hemorrhage, and, depending on CT results, an MRI with contrast to check for ischemic stroke or CNS abscess. If MRI confirms an abscess, neurosurgery consultation may be necessary.\n3. Address compliance issues: The patient's inconsistent medication adherence might have compromised his HIV control and opportunistic infection prevention. Consult infectious disease for HIV management adjustments and education reinforcement.\n4. Manage acute hypertension: The elevated blood pressure (156/92 mmHg) should be addressed carefully to prevent further vascular damage or stroke exacerbation if it's confirmed as such. Consult cardiology or ensure the ED physician adjusts antihypertensives appropriately.\n5. Follow-up: Monitor hemodynamic stability, neurological status, and infection control response. Arrange continued care through a multidisciplinary team including primary care, infectious disease, neurology, and cardiology.\n\nRemember to perform other supportive tests, such as complete blood count, metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP), to aid in assessing his current status and response to interventions.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the presented case:\n1. The patient's advanced HIV disease with a very low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high viral load (>100,000 copies/mL) suggests severe immunosuppression.\n2. The neurological symptoms\u2014right leg weakness, unsteady gait, falls, forgetfulness, disorientation, difficulty with executive functions (e.g., troubleshooting appliances)\u2014and MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are consistent with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, specifically, HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) in its more severe form, HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD).\n3. The patient's lack of medication adherence over the past 2 years has likely contributed to disease progression and exacerbated his neurological symptoms.\n4. The Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity suggests a past infection, but given the absence of mass lesions on MRI and lack of fever, acute toxoplasmosis is less likely as the primary cause of these symptoms. Nonetheless, reactivation cannot be definitively ruled out without further investigation such as lumbar puncture or brain biopsy (though invasive), but clinically, in this context, HAD appears more plausible.\n5. The peripheral lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary, and inguinal) may simply represent HIV-associated lymphoid hyperplasia, rather than a concurrent malignancy or other opportunistic infection.\n6. Anemia (Hb 9.2 g/dL), leukopenia (3600/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (140,000/mm3) can be attributed to HIV-related bone marrow suppression, medication side effects, or comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes).\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD), a severe form of HAND. Immediate management should focus on initiating or optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ART) and addressing secondary issues, such as opportunistic infection screening, supportive care for weakened limbs, and consultation with neurology and infectious diseases specialists.",

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For a low-risk, 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation, with no significant medical history and up-to-date vaccinations, the standard tests at her first prenatal visit include:\n\n1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) to assess for anemia and baseline hemoglobin levels.\n2. Blood type (ABO and Rh status) and antibody screen: This identifies potential issues of Rh incompatibility if the woman is Rh-negative and the fetus might inherit Rh-positivity from the father.\n3. Hepatitis B surface antigen testing (HBsAg) to screen for active hepatitis B infection or carrier state.\n4. Urinalysis: This detects bacteriuria, proteinuria, or glucose, which are indicators for potential complications such as asymptomatic bacteriuria or gestational diabetes mellitus (to be assessed later in pregnancy).\n5. Rubella IgG antibody test: Though her vaccination record indicates she is up-to-date, this test confirms immunity against rubella (German measles) as a precautionary measure for fetal protection.\n6. Varicella IgG antibody test, if there's uncertainty about her varicella (chickenpox) vaccination or past disease, to ensure she's immune (though typically established earlier in life).\n7. In some regions, prenatal screening for syphilis (Treponema pallidum) with serological tests like VDRL or RPR may still be performed at the first visit, although she previously tested negative 4 years ago. However, testing for syphilis during pregnancy is often jurisdiction-specific and generally follows national guidelines, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, with periodic testing recommended for certain risk groups but not universally for all low-risk pregnancies.\n8. Cervical swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae would typically not be repeated if conducted previously and returned negative (like in this case - 4 years ago), unless there is evidence of a new sexual partner or risky sexual behavior since the last test. CDC guidelines do, however, recommend routine Chlamydia screening for pregnant women under 25 years old, despite previous negative tests.\n9. Prenatal genetic screening, including combined first-trimester screening for Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18 via blood tests (PAPP-A and \u03b2-hCG levels), or non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) if clinically appropriate and affordable.\n\n",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, given the patient's severe CD4+ T cell depletion (CD4 count 33 cells/mm3) following six months of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) complicated by depression, the following steps are crucial:\n1. Reinitiate ART with a simplified, tolerable, and potent regimen, preferably including two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; e.g., tenofovir and emtricitabine) plus an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (e.g., dolutegravir) or a boosted protease inhibitor (e.g., darunavir + ritonavir).\n2. Address opportunistic infections prophylaxis due to severely compromised immunity (CD4 < 50 cells/mm3). In this case:\n  - Start trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.\n  - Prescribe fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis, especially if there are any clinical signs of oral or esophageal candidiasis.\n  - Consider secondary prophylaxis for Toxoplasma gondii (pyrimethamine + leucovorin) if the patient has previous toxoplasmosis or is seropositive, though this is less common practice at CD4 < 50 cells/mm3 in contemporary US guidelines, given early ART initiation goals.\n  - Consider primary or secondary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) with azithromycin if additional risk factors or previous infection history applies, although this is less emphasized when CD4 is being rapidly restored under effective ART.\n3. Manage depression:\n  - Consult with a psychiatrist or mental health provider for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan, ideally, using medications with minimal drug-drug interactions with ART (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or newer classes like vortioxetine).\n  - Ensure the patient is engaged in psychological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, to address adherence barriers and overall well-being.\n\nImportant: It is crucial that the patient re-engage with care promptly and adhere to ART to prevent further immunosuppression and opportunistic infections. Frequent follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor his response to therapy, including labs assessing CD4 count recovery, HIV viral load suppression, and the prophylaxis effectiveness for opportunistic infections.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, particularly the skin lesions' biopsy showing vascular proliferation and black bacteria (consistent with _Bartonella henselae_), the diagnosis here is Bacillary Angiomatosis, an opportunistic infection common in advanced HIV (low CD4+ count, in this case, 98/mm3). Given the context, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be antibiotics effective against _Bartonella_ species.\n1. Erythromycin: This is considered the first-line treatment for Bacillary Angiomatosis, typically prescribed at 500 mg orally four times daily for at least 3 months or until lesions resolve.\n2. Doxycycline: This is an alternative, particularly useful if there's concern about macrolide resistance or intolerance; 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 months.\n3. For severe or disseminated disease, intravenous gentamicin might be added to the regimen, especially if patient's systemic symptoms, like fever, don't respond promptly to oral antibiotics alone.\n\nAdditionally, antiretroviral therapy (ART) optimization or initiation for her HIV is essential to improve immunity and overall health outcomes. The timing of ART initiation in a patient with an opportunistic infection like Bacillary Angiomatosis is somewhat nuanced but typically should not be delayed for HIV patients with CD4 counts <100/mm3, as in this case, despite their acute infection requiring primary attention.\nThe patient's substance use (smoking, alcohol, IV cocaine) and malnutrition (BMI 19 kg/m2) also require addressing to reduce morbidity and mortality risk, ideally in a multidisciplinary healthcare setting. However, in the immediate emergency department management, antibiotics against _B. henselae_ are the primary focus.\n\nReferences:\n- Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 9th edition\n- CDC Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents\n- UpToDate: Treatment of Bacillary Angiomatosis\n- HIV InSite, University of California, San Francisco: ART Initiation in Acute Opportunistic Infections",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2.

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Given the antiretrovall (ART) regimen prescribed - lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (ZDV), and indinavir - here are primary adverse effect risks for this patient:\n\n1. Indinavir-specific:\n   - Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) due to indinavir's low water solubility, which increases crystallization in the urinary tract.\n   - Hyperglycemia or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes, as protease inhibitors like indinavir are known to decrease insulin sensitivity.\n\n2. Zidovudine (AZT)-related:\n   - Hematologic: Anemia (AZT can cause bone marrow suppression), neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, which necessitate periodic blood count monitoring.\n   - Myopathy (muscle pain, weakness, or cramps) is less common but still worth monitoring, especially with prolonged use.\n\n3. Lamivudine (3TC) is generally well-tolerated, but shared nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) side effects include:\n   - Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain)\n   - Lactic acidosis (rare but life-threatening; monitor for unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, or dyspnea)\n\n4. Lipodystrophy and metabolic changes:\n   - As a class effect, protease inhibitors, including indinavir, can contribute to lipodystrophy (peripheral fat wasting, central fat accumulation) and dyslipidemias, which require diet adjustments and potential medication for hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n5. Long-term monitoring for all ART: Patients should be assessed regularly for potential mitochondrial dysfunction, steatohepatitis, and bone loss, given the chronicity of HIV therapy.\n\nNote that this patient's initial CD4 count and viral load indicate early initiation of therapy, and current guidelines typically recommend an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus two NRTIs. However, for the purposes of this question, we assume the specified regimen is deliberately chosen, or that this is a historic case prior to INSTI adoption.\n\nResources:\n- U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (2021)\n- Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Prescribing Information: Indinavir, Zidovudine, and Lamivudine\n- Up",

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic tests, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) associated with immune suppression in an HIV-positive individual.\n\nHere's the rationale:\n\n1. HIV status and inconsistent medication adherence: The patient's HIV infection with intermittent non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy until recently has likely led to immune suppression, increasing his susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies.\n2. Neurological symptoms: Headaches, vertigo, ataxia, apathy, and cognitive impairment (low MMSE score) suggest a significant intracranial pathology.\n3. Brain MRI: The solitary, ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, measuring 4.5 cm, is consistent with PCNSL, which typically presents as a single large lesion, often with ring-enhancement post-contrast.\n4. CSF findings: Although pleocytosis is mild, the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid is indicative of EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder, commonly seen in HIV+ patients, supporting the diagnosis of PCNSL.\n5. Low CD4 count: His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 90/\u03bcL confirms severe immunodeficiency, further increasing the likelihood of PCNSL in this setting.\n\nWhile toxoplasmosis can also present as a ring-enhancing lesion, the EBV DNA in CSF and the lack of typical bilateral involvement make PCNSL a more probable diagnosis. It's essential to consider biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, but the clinical picture and investigations strongly suggest PCNSL in this HIV-positive patient.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "For this HIV-exposed newborn, given the mother's controlled but non-undetectable viral load (678 copies/mL) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) near delivery, and an uncomplicated birth process, the most appropriate next step is:\n\n1. Administer zidovudine (ZDV) as prophylaxis for the infant, as per CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, starting as soon as possible (ideally within 2-4 hours of birth) and continuing for 6 weeks. This monotherapy regimen is the standard for infants born to mothers with known HIV receiving ART but with detectable viral loads (> 50-200 copies/mL, though exact threshold varies by organization; in this case > 600 copies/mL is clearly above) at or near delivery.\n\n2. Ensure the newborn receives routine postnatal care, such as vitamin K administration and eye prophylaxis for gonorrhea prevention (erythromycin ointment), without alterations based on the mother's HIV status.\n3. Plan for ongoing follow-up and monitoring in the pediatric infectious disease or HIV specialty clinic to assess for any potential vertical transmission of HIV and manage prophylactic treatment.\n4. Perform baseline HIV antibody testing (not a definitive test for infant infection due to passively acquired maternal antibodies) to establish a baseline for future assessments. Plan for subsequent HIV PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests to definitively rule in or out vertical transmission\u2014at approximately 2, 6, 12, and 18-24 months.\n5. Vaccinations for this HIV-exposed infant should be given according to regular schedules and guidelines, with no alterations related to the mother's HIV status.\n\nPlease note that these recommendations assume a current understanding of 2021 guidelines. It's always wise to consult the most recent versions of guidelines from reliable resources like the CDC, World Health Organization, or the American Academy of Pediatrics for an HIV-exposed newborn's management.",
