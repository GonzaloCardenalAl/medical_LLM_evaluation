    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and imaging findings, along with her HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, suggest primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV infection. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as EBV is often associated with PCNSL. The MRI findings of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders are also consistent with PCNSL.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "### Medication for HIV Treatment: Enfuvirtide\n\n#### Overview\nEnfuvirtide is a medication used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is a fusion inhibitor, which means it works by preventing the virus from entering host cells.\n\n#### Mechanism of Action\nEnfuvirtide acts by binding to the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. This binding prevents the gp41 subunit from undergoing a conformational change that is necessary for the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n\n#### Clinical Use\nEnfuvirtide is typically used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat HIV/AIDS. It is usually reserved for patients who have failed other treatments or have a high viral load.\n\n#### Important Considerations\nEnfuvirtide is administered via subcutaneous injection and can cause injection site reactions. It is also associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia.\n\n#### Answer\nEnfuvirtide is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "Boiling the formula for an extended period of time can cause denaturation of proteins and inactivation of vitamins, including Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is easily destroyed by heat, water, and oxygen. Boiling the formula for too long can lead to the oxidation of Vitamin C, which results in the formation of dehydroascorbic acid, an inactive form of Vitamin C. This can lead to a deficiency of Vitamin C in the infant, which can cause scurvy, a disease characterized by fatigue, malaise, bleeding gums, and poor wound healing. Therefore, it is essential to heat the formula only to the required temperature and for the required duration to preserve the nutritional value of the formula.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient is likely experiencing pancreatitis as a side effect of didanosine, which is known to cause this condition. Didanosine should be discontinued immediately. After the pancreatitis resolves, the patient should be started on a different antiretroviral regimen that does not include didanosine. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of pancreatitis recurrence, and her antiretroviral regimen should be adjusted as necessary to ensure that she is receiving effective treatment for her HIV infection while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody the physician scientist is designing is gp120. The gp120 protein is a surface glycoprotein of the HIV envelope and is the primary target of the natural humoral immune response against HIV. Antibodies against gp120 can neutralize the virus by blocking its attachment to CD4+ T cells, which is necessary for viral entry. Therefore, developing a more potent antibody against gp120 could potentially provide a more effective treatment for HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."
