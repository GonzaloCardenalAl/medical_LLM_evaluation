Ribavirin (although not exclusively for HIV, it was sometimes used in combination)\n\nHowever, please note that the primary option in 1990 was monotherapy with Zidovudine (AZT). The other options were introduced later or used in specific cases.",

    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, individuals who were diagnosed with HIV before the age of 20 tended to have a slower CD4 decline compared to those diagnosed after 20.
