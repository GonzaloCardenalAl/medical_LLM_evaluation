    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. The five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland at that time were likely:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was not yet widely used, so it's possible that Acyclovir was used, although not specifically for HIV, it was used for herpes simplex \n5. Ribavirin, although not specifically approved for HIV, was sometimes used in combination with other medications.\n\nKeep in mind that the treatment landscape for HIV has evolved significantly since 1990, and these medications are no longer the primary treatment options.",

    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, individuals who were tested before age 20 tended to have a slower CD4 decline compared to those tested after age 20. The median time to CD4 <200 cells/\u03bcL was approximately 7-8 years for those diagnosed before 20, and around 4-5 years for those diagnosed after 20. This suggests that younger individuals at diagnosis may have a more gradual disease progression.",
