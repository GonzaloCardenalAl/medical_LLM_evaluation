    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as PCNSL is often associated with EBV in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, a more commonly used medication in this class is not typically the first-line treatment. \n\nA more likely answer is that the physician might discuss the use of Enfuvirtide or other entry inhibitors, but a more commonly prescribed medication targeting the HIV envelope is not typically the first-line treatment for a newly diagnosed HIV patient. \n\nIn this scenario, the physician is more likely to prescribe a combination of medications from different classes such as NRTIs, NNRTIs, or Integrase inhibitors. \n\nBut to answer your question, the class of medication that acts on the gp41 subunit is the HIV fusion inhibitors, with Enfuvirtide being an example.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the molecular process that could be impaired is denaturation of proteins and degradation of vitamins, particularly Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a heat-labile vitamin, meaning it can be inactivated or broken down when exposed to high temperatures, leading to a loss of its nutritional value.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, didanosine is likely the culprit, as it's known to cause pancreatitis as a side effect. To prevent recurrence, didanosine should be discontinued and replaced with an alternative antiretroviral medication. The patient can likely continue with zidovudine and efavirenz, but didanosine will need to be swapped out for a different medication to minimize the risk of pancreatitis relapse.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody is the gp120 protein, which is part of the HIV envelope. This protein is a key component of the virus that binds to host cells and is a primary target of the natural humoral immune response.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Adding valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, such as neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, due to the overlapping myelosuppressive effects of valganciclovir and zidovudine. Close monitoring of his blood counts is necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "In patients with latent HIV-1, DNA methylation profiles often show increased methylation of the HIV-1 promoter region, which helps suppress viral transcription. In contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with decreased methylation of the promoter region, allowing for viral replication. Additionally, global DNA methylation changes have been observed in HIV-1 infected individuals, affecting host genes involved in immune response and cellular regulation.",
    "true_answer": "I searched for your question and found some relevant results. According to these results, **DNA methylation** is a possible mechanism that regulates the **latency** and **reactivation** of **HIV-1 provirus** in infected cells  . However, the **methylation profiles** of HIV-1 proviral DNA may vary depending on the **disease progression**, **antiretroviral therapy**, and **cell type** of the patients ."
