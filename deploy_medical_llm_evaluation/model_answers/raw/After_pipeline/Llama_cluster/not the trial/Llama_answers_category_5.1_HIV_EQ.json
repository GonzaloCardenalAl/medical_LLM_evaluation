    "question": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?",
    "answer": "For HIV-positive patients, the American Heart Association and European guidelines recommend considering statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD when the 10-year risk is \u22655%. However, since HIV infection itself increases CVD risk, some guidelines suggest using a lower threshold.\n\nFor both patients, with a SCORE2 estimate of 5%, consider starting statin therapy, especially since they have additional risk factors due to their HIV status. But, also assess other risk factors, such as family history, lipid profiles, and blood pressure, before making a final decision.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended."

    "question": "Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity?",
    "answer": "No, it's not due to ethnicity. Higher HIV rates in Black communities are largely due to social and economic factors, such as:\n\n* Limited access to healthcare and HIV testing\n* Higher rates of poverty and unemployment\n* Increased exposure to high-risk networks\n* Stigma and discrimination\n\nThese factors contribute to disparities in HIV infection rates, not ethnicity itself.",
    "true_answer": "No, ethnicity is not considered a risk factor to get infected with HIV."

    "question": "In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty. I am a clinician located in Uganda. Should I consider HIV-positive patients homosexuals?",
    "answer": "No, you should not assume that an HIV-positive patient is homosexual. HIV can be transmitted through various routes, including heterosexual sex, mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusions, and injecting drug use. It's essential to provide non-judgmental and stigma-free care to all patients, regardless of their sexual orientation or HIV status. Focus on individual risk factors and medical history to provide appropriate care and support.",
    "true_answer": "No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population."

    "question": "32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, particularly the erythema migrans rash after a hiking trip in an endemic area, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease. However, considering the patient's recent unprotected anal receptive intercourse, it's also essential to test for acute HIV infection (AHI) and other STIs, as some symptoms like fever, fatigue, and muscle aches can be similar. I recommend ordering tests for Lyme disease (e.g., IgM and IgG antibodies) and acute HIV infection (e.g., HIV antigen/antibody test, HIV viral load).",
    "true_answer": "These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 34-year-old HIV-positive pregnant woman presents for a check-up at week 36. The HIV viral load shows 190 copies/mL. Should I offer an alternative to natural birth?",
    "answer": "Yes, consider offering a cesarean section (C-section) or discussing the risks and benefits of vaginal delivery. The viral load is below 1000 copies/mL, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a planned C-section for women with a viral load >100 copies/mL near the time of delivery to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. However, the decision should be individualized and based on the patient's overall health and preferences.",
    "true_answer": "An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery. For unscheduled cesarean delivery: consider administering loading dose then proceed to delivery."

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy. She is HLA-B*57:01 positive and CVD risk >10%. Should I treat her with ABC/3TC + DTG drug regimen?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's HLA-B*57:01 positivity, it's recommended to avoid Abacavir (ABC) due to the increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction. \n\nConsider an alternative regimen, such as TAF/FTC + DTG, which is a safe and effective option for this patient.",
    "true_answer": "No, the ABC/3TC + DTG treatment regimen can not be used in people with high cardiovascular risk and HLA-B*57:01 positive."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation. The blood test indicated HIV-VL > 50,000 copies/mL. Is it appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy?",
    "answer": "No, it's not appropriate. With a high viral load (VL) > 50,000 copies/mL, the patient is likely experiencing treatment failure or non-adherence. Changing to a dual therapy like XTC (emtricitabine) + TDF (tenofovir) may not provide sufficient viral suppression. A more effective approach would be to optimize the current regimen or switch to a new regimen with at least three fully active drugs, considering resistance testing results.",
    "true_answer": "XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy."

    "question": "A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?",
    "answer": "The patient is on TAF/FTC/BIC (tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, bictegravir) for HIV. Phenytoin, an antiepileptic, is known to induce glucuronidation, which may decrease bictegravir levels. This interaction could potentially lead to reduced efficacy of the ART regimen and increased viral load. Consider monitoring viral load more closely and discussing alternative antiepileptic options or adjusting the ART regimen if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately."

  {
    "question": "A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive. Is it appropriate to prescribe a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG?",
    "answer": "No, it's not appropriate. The patient was already on a regimen containing tenofovir DF (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), which is similar to 3TC. Since he acquired HIV despite PrEP, it's likely he has a strain resistant to TDF and/or FTC. \n\nA better option would be to start a new regimen with a different backbone, such as abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) or doravirine (DOR) with a third agent like dolutegravir (DTG) or darunavir (DRV). Resistance testing should also be performed to guide treatment.",
    "true_answer": "XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen. Future steps have to be evaluated carefully by an HIV specialist clinician which would involve HIV genotypic resistance testing, assessing adherence of the patient and patient\u2019s partner to medication."
