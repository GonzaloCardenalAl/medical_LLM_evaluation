    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the results of the lumbar puncture, it is likely that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The elevated opening pressure, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to the antifungal treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which is appropriate for cryptococcal meningitis, the patient may also benefit from the following additional treatment in the acute setting:\n\n1. **Repeat lumbar punctures**: To relieve elevated intracranial pressure, which can be life-threatening. The goal is to reduce the opening pressure to < 200 mm H2O.\n2. **Corticosteroids**: Not routinely recommended, but may be considered in patients with severe headache or elevated intracranial pressure.\n3. **Anticonvulsants**: If the patient has a history of seizures or is at high risk of seizures, anticonvulsants may be started prophylactically.\n4. **Supportive care**: Aggressive management of symptoms, such as pain, fever, and fatigue, as well as monitoring for potential complications, such as respiratory failure or cardiac dysfunction.\n5. **Adjunctive treatments**: Consideration of adjunctive treatments, such as interferon-gamma or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), may be made on a case-by-case basis, although their role is still being studied.\n\nIt is essential to note that the management of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS requires a multidisciplinary approach, and the patient should be closely monitored by a team of healthcare professionals, including an infectious disease specialist, a neurologist, and other support staff.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\n- True Positives (TP) = 240 (patients with AIDS who tested positive)\n- False Positives (FP) = 5 (patients without AIDS who tested positive)\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nTo find the True Negatives (TN) and False Negatives (FN), we need to calculate them based on the given data:\n\n- True Negatives (TN) = Total patients without AIDS - False Positives = 250 - 5 = 245\n- False Negatives (FN) = Total patients with AIDS - True Positives = 250 - 240 = 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n     = 245 / (245 + 10)\n     = 245 / 255\n     = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of the individuals who test negative actually do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's sudden onset of weakness in one extremity, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes opportunistic infections, stroke, and other neurological conditions. The patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases his risk for opportunistic infections and potentially for neurological manifestations related to HIV or other pathogens.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient involves several concurrent actions:\n\n1. **Stabilization and Initial Assessment**: Ensure the patient is stable, with particular attention to his airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Given his fever and potential for an infectious cause, consider drawing blood cultures and starting empiric antibiotics if an infectious process is suspected, pending further diagnostic workup.\n\n2. **Neurological Evaluation**: A thorough neurological examination has already been initiated. However, given the focal neurological deficit (weakness in the distal muscles of the right extremity), it is crucial to consider conditions such as stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), CNS infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, given his immunocompromised state), or other space-occupying lesions.\n\n3. **Imaging Studies**: Urgent neuroimaging is warranted. A non-contrast CT scan of the head can quickly identify hemorrhagic strokes, large ischemic strokes, and some space-occupying lesions. However, given the patient's HIV status and the potential for opportunistic infections or CNS lymphoma, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast may provide more detailed information about the nature of the lesion or pathology.\n\n4. **Laboratory Tests**: In addition to blood cultures, consider ordering:\n   - Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential to assess for signs of infection or inflammation.\n   - Basic metabolic panel (BMP) and liver function tests (LFTs) to evaluate for any metabolic derangements.\n   - CD4 count and HIV viral load to assess the current state of his HIV infection.\n   - Toxoplasma IgG antibodies (if not previously done) to assess for toxoplasmosis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients.\n   - Consider lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis if CNS infection is suspected, but this should be done after neuroimaging to rule out space-occupying lesions that could make LP unsafe.\n\n5. **Consultations**: Early consultation with neurology and infectious disease specialists is recommended to help guide further management, especially given the patient's complex medical history and immunocompromised state.\n\n6. **Therapeutic Considerations**: Depending on the findings from the above steps, therapy may include antipyretics for fever, antiepileptics if seizures are a concern, and specific treatments for identified conditions (e.g., antivirals for HIV, antibiotics for bacterial infections, antifungals for fungal infections).\n\nIn summary, the next best step involves a comprehensive assessment including stabilization, neurological evaluation, imaging studies, laboratory tests, and early consultation with relevant specialists to guide further management and treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key findings that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **Clinical presentation**: The patient has a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls, which suggests a neurological disorder. His cognitive decline, forgetfulness, and difficulty with daily activities are also consistent with PML.\n2. **HIV status and immunosuppression**: The patient has a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and a high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL), indicating severe immunosuppression. This increases his risk for opportunistic infections, including PML.\n3. **Neuroimaging findings**: The MRI shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect, which is characteristic of PML. These lesions are typically seen in the subcortical white matter and can be asymmetric.\n4. **Laboratory results**: The patient's laboratory results, including his low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, suggest a chronic illness with possible bone marrow suppression. The presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies is not uncommon in HIV-infected individuals, but it does not directly support a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in this case.\n5. **Differential diagnosis**: Other potential diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis, are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen test and the lack of mass effect on the MRI.\n\nPML is a rare and often fatal demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severe immunosuppression, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The disease is characterized by progressive damage to the white matter of the brain, leading to cognitive decline, motor weakness, and other neurological symptoms.\n\nIt's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of PML typically requires a brain biopsy or detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by PCR. However, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, PML is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Given the information provided, the following tests should be considered for this 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor:** Determining the blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh factor (Rh positive or Rh negative) is crucial. If the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh positive, there's a risk the baby may be Rh positive, which could lead to complications if not managed properly.\n3. **Rubella Immunity:** Ensuring the mother is immune to rubella (German measles) is important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus.\n4. **Varicella Immunity:** Testing for immunity to varicella (chickenpox) to assess the risk of varicella infection during pregnancy.\n5. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):** Screening for hepatitis B infection, which can be transmitted to the fetus during birth.\n6. **Syphilis Screening:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, syphilis screening is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit due to the risk of congenital syphilis.\n7. **Urinalysis:** To check for urinary tract infections (UTIs), proteinuria, and glucosuria, which can indicate gestational diabetes or other renal issues.\n8. **Pap Smear (if due):** If the patient's last Pap smear was not within the recommended screening interval (typically every 3 years for women aged 21-65), a Pap smear may be performed to screen for cervical cancer.\n9. **Ultrasonography:** An ultrasound at this stage can confirm the gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and identify potential fetal anomalies early on.\n10. **HIV Screening:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HIV screening for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, as the risk factors may have changed.\n11. **Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening:** Given the time since her last negative test and the potential for new exposures, screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is recommended, especially for pregnant women under the age of 25.\n12. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening:** Typically performed between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation, but discussing the risk factors and planning for this screening is appropriate at the initial visit.\n13. **Carrier Screening for Genetic Disorders:** Depending on the patient's ethnic background and family history, screening for genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or thalassemia may be recommended.\n\nIt's also important during this visit to discuss dietary advice, folic acid supplementation (if not already taking), and any concerns or questions the patient or her husband may have regarding the pregnancy.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to his HIV medications, resulting in a significantly low CD4+ count, it's essential to address both his mental health and the increased risk of opportunistic infections associated with a low CD4+ count.\n\n1. **For Depression**: The patient should be evaluated and treated for depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat depression in HIV-positive patients. Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil). However, it's crucial to consider potential drug-drug interactions between SSRIs and antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly with regard to the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. For instance, some antiretrovirals can interact with SSRIs, either by increasing or decreasing their levels. Therefore, the choice of SSRI should be made carefully, considering these potential interactions.\n\n2. **For Prevention of Opportunistic Infections**: With a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm^3, the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections. The following prophylactic medications should be considered:\n   - **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the first-line choice for PCP prophylaxis. It is typically started when the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm^3.\n   - **Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis**: TMP-SMX also provides protection against toxoplasmosis. If the patient is intolerant to TMP-SMX, alternatives such as dapsone plus pyrimethamine or atovaquone can be considered.\n   - **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis**: Azithromycin is recommended for MAC prophylaxis when the CD4+ count falls below 50 cells/mm^3.\n   - **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other opportunistic infection prophylaxis**: Depending on the patient's specific risk factors and symptoms, prophylaxis against other opportunistic infections might be necessary.\n\n3. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Optimization**: Given the patient's history of non-adherence, it's crucial to reassess and potentially modify his ART regimen to ensure it is simple, tolerable, and effective. The goal is to improve adherence and achieve viral suppression.\n\n4. **Support and Adherence Counseling**: The patient should receive counseling on the importance of adherence to his medication regimen, including both his ART and any prophylactic medications. Support systems, such as directly observed therapy (DOT) or medication adherence programs, might be beneficial.\n\nIn summary, the patient should be started on an SSRI for depression, selected with careful consideration of potential interactions with his ART. He should also receive prophylactic medications for PCP, toxoplasmosis, and MAC, given his low CD4+ count. Optimization of his ART regimen and adherence counseling are also critical components of his care.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA). BA is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which is common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe biopsy of the skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which is characteristic of BA. The presence of white patches on the palate that can be scraped off also suggests oral candidiasis, which is common in HIV-infected patients.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is:\n\n* Erythromycin: 500 mg orally four times a day for at least 3 months. Alternative treatments include:\n\t+ Doxycycline: 100 mg orally twice a day for at least 3 months.\n\t+ Azithromycin: 500 mg orally once a day for at least 3 months.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low (98/mm3), indicating advanced immunosuppression. Therefore, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized to improve the patient's immune function and prevent further opportunistic infections.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's substance use and smoking history should be addressed, and she should be screened for other potential health issues, such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and other sexually transmitted infections.",

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the medications started, specifically:\n\n1. **Lamivudine and Zidovudine (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors - NRTIs):**\n   - **Lactic acidosis:** A potentially fatal condition that can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n   - **Hepatomegaly with steatosis:** Enlargement of the liver with fatty deposits.\n   - **Neutropenia and anemia:** Decrease in white blood cells and red blood cells, respectively.\n   - **Peripheral neuropathy:** Damage to the peripheral nerves, causing pain, numbness, or weakness in the hands and feet.\n\n2. **Indinavir (Protease Inhibitor - PI):**\n   - **Nephrolithiasis:** Kidney stones, which can be very painful and may require medical intervention.\n   - **Hyperbilirubinemia:** Elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood, which can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n   - **Gastrointestinal symptoms:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\n   - **Lipodystrophy syndrome:** Changes in body fat distribution, which can lead to abnormal fat accumulation or loss.\n\nGiven the combination of these medications, the patient is at risk for a broad range of side effects. However, one of the most notable and specific risks associated with Indinavir is **nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)** due to its mechanism of action and known side effect profile. The other medications also carry significant risks, but the question asks for the greatest risk, and among these options, the unique and directly associated risk with Indinavir stands out. \n\nIt's also important to note that the management of HIV involves careful monitoring for these side effects and adjusting the treatment regimen as necessary to minimize risks while effectively controlling the virus.",

Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **HIV-positive status with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count**: The patient has a history of HIV and a low CD4+ count, which increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, which are common symptoms of PCNSL.\n3. **Mini-Mental State Examination score**: The patient's low score (15/30) indicates significant cognitive impairment, which is consistent with PCNSL.\n4. **Imaging findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, which is a characteristic feature of PCNSL.\n5. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supports the diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV.\n\nOther possible diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), are less likely given the patient's presentation and test results. Toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions, and PML usually shows a more diffuse white matter involvement on imaging.\n\nIt's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of PCNSL may require a biopsy or further testing, such as a stereotactic brain biopsy or a repeat lumbar puncture with CSF cytology and flow cytometry. However, based on the available information, PCNSL is the most likely diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant, born to an HIV-positive mother, involves several considerations to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, as well as standard newborn care. Given that the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and had a viral load of 678 copies/mL close to delivery, the risk of MTCT is significantly reduced, but not eliminated. Here are the steps to consider:\n\n1. **Administer Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to the Newborn**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all infants born to HIV-positive mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent MTCT of HIV. The typical regimen for the newborn is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks. However, the specific regimen might be adjusted based on the mother's ART regimen and resistance patterns.\n\n2. **HIV Testing**: The baby should undergo HIV testing. The initial test is usually a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect the presence of HIV RNA or DNA. This should be done at 14-21 days of life, and if negative, repeated at 1-2 months and again at 4-6 months of age. If any of these tests are positive, they should be confirmed with a second test.\n\n3. **Standard Newborn Care**: Regardless of the HIV status of the mother, standard newborn care should be provided. This includes routine vaccinations (though live vaccines might be contraindicated if the baby is found to be HIV-positive), newborn screening tests, and monitoring for common newborn conditions.\n\n4. **Follow-Up**: Close follow-up with a pediatrician experienced in the care of HIV-exposed infants is crucial. This includes monitoring for signs of HIV infection and potential side effects of antiretroviral prophylaxis, as well as providing support and guidance to the mother.\n\n5. **Breastfeeding Consideration**: In settings where safe alternatives are readily available, HIV-positive mothers are advised against breastfeeding to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV. However, in resource-limited settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, with the mother continuing on effective ART and the infant receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis.\n\nGiven the information provided and considering standard practices, the most immediate next step would be to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis (likely zidovudine) for the newborn, arrange for follow-up appointments for HIV testing and monitoring, and ensure the mother and baby receive appropriate medical and social support.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
