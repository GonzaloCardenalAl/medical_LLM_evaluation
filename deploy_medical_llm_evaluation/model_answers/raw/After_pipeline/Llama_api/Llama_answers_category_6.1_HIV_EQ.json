    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and CSF findings, it appears that the patient has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the antifungal treatment, the patient may benefit from adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, specifically to reduce the increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The elevated opening pressure of 285 mm H2O suggests increased ICP, which can be a complication of cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nThe use of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, can help reduce the inflammation and edema associated with the infection, thereby decreasing the ICP. However, corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with AIDS, as they can also exacerbate immunosuppression.\n\nRegarding the previous patient who was prescribed chloramphenicol, it is likely that this patient had a different diagnosis, such as bacterial meningitis, as chloramphenicol is an antibiotic and not an antifungal medication.\n\nIn summary, the additional treatment that may be warranted in this patient is adjunctive corticosteroid therapy to manage increased ICP, in addition to the antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, ICP, and overall clinical condition is essential to guide further management.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we first need to understand what NPV represents. NPV is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease. Mathematically, it is calculated as the number of true negatives (TN) divided by the sum of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN).\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS = 250\n- Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 240\n- Patients without AIDS = 250\n- Patients without AIDS who tested positive (false positives) = 5\n\nFirst, let's identify the true negatives and false negatives:\n- True negatives (TN) are the patients without AIDS who tested negative. Since 5 out of 250 patients without AIDS tested positive, 250 - 5 = 245 patients without AIDS tested negative.\n- False negatives (FN) are the patients with AIDS who tested negative. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 250 - 240 = 10 patients with AIDS tested negative.\n\nNow, calculate the NPV:\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n     = 245 / (245 + 10)\n     = 245 / 255\n     = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel test is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of the patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis or a focal brain lesion such as toxoplasmosis, is high. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a focal neurological deficit, which could be consistent with a variety of conditions including stroke, CNS lymphoma, or a focal infection.\n\nThe next best step in management would involve:\n\n1. **Immediate Imaging**: A CT or MRI of the brain should be performed to evaluate for stroke, focal lesions, or other structural abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count, it's crucial to consider opportunistic infections and malignancies that could cause focal neurological deficits.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: \n   - **CD4 Count and Viral Load**: Although the patient's CD4 count is known, verifying it and checking the viral load can guide the management of his HIV and the risk for opportunistic infections.\n   - **Blood Cultures**: Given the patient's fever, blood cultures should be drawn to rule out bacteremia or fungemia.\n   - **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: If the imaging suggests a condition that would benefit from CSF analysis (e.g., suspected meningitis or CNS infection), a lumbar puncture should be performed. This would include testing for cryptococcal antigen, among other pathogens.\n\n3. **Empiric Treatment Adjustment**: The use of itraconazole as empiric treatment may not be the best choice given the patient's presentation. Itraconazole is used for certain fungal infections, but the initial management should be guided by the suspected diagnosis based on clinical presentation and diagnostic tests. For example, if toxoplasmosis is suspected, empiric treatment with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine would be more appropriate. If there's suspicion of a bacterial infection, appropriate antibiotics should be started. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence should be reinforced as improving the patient's immune status is crucial in preventing and managing opportunistic infections.\n\n4. **Stroke Evaluation**: Given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and the sudden onset of weakness, a stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) must be considered and evaluated promptly. This would typically involve urgent imaging (CT or MRI) and possibly further stroke workup.\n\n5. **Neurological Consultation**: Consultation with a neurologist, particularly one with experience in HIV-related neurological conditions, would be beneficial in guiding the diagnostic workup and management.\n\nIn summary, the next best step involves a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation including imaging, laboratory tests, and potentially CSF analysis, followed by targeted treatment based on the suspected or confirmed diagnosis, rather than starting with empiric itraconazole.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) or Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as leg weakness, unsteady gait, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, are consistent with a neurological disorder. The patient's HIV status, low CD4+ count, and high viral load suggest that an opportunistic infection or a direct effect of HIV on the brain is likely.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are consistent with PML, which is a rare and often fatal demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus. PML is more common in individuals with immunocompromised states, such as those with advanced HIV infection.\n\nHAND is also a possibility, as it is a common neurological complication of HIV infection. However, the presence of focal neurological deficits, such as leg weakness, and the MRI findings of white matter lesions are more suggestive of PML.\n\nVascular dementia is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a vascular cause. The patient's age, HIV status, and lack of a history of stroke or vascular disease also make vascular dementia less likely.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, further testing, such as a lumbar puncture to test for JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, may be necessary. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy to improve the patient's immune status and reduce the HIV viral load, as well as supportive care to manage symptoms, may be initiated.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Based on the information provided and current prenatal care guidelines, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: Determining the blood type and Rh factor is crucial for identifying potential incompatibility issues between the mother's and fetus's blood, which could necessitate special management during pregnancy and delivery.\n3. **Rubella Immunity**: Confirming immunity to rubella (German measles) is important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome.\n4. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)**: Screening for hepatitis B infection to manage and prevent vertical transmission to the newborn.\n5. **Syphilis Screening**: Testing for syphilis, typically using a non-treponemal test (e.g., VDRL or RPR), followed by a treponemal test for confirmation if the initial test is positive.\n6. **Urine Culture**: To screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to urinary tract infections and, if untreated, increase the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm labor.\n7. **Pap Smear (if due)**: If the patient is due for a cervical cancer screening according to current guidelines, a Pap smear should be performed.\n8. **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone)**: As mentioned, your hospital has been testing for Serum TSH. This is appropriate for assessing thyroid function, as undiagnosed and untreated thyroid dysfunction can have adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes.\n9. **CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Serology**: Your hospital's protocol includes testing for CMV serology. CMV is a common virus that can infect anyone and may cause serious disease in people with weakened immune systems, as well as congenital infection if a woman is infected during pregnancy.\n10. **PCR for HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2)**: Also part of your hospital's protocol. Knowing the HSV status can help manage and potentially prevent neonatal herpes, a serious condition.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that not all professional guidelines recommend universal screening for CMV or HSV-2 for all pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide guidelines that may not include routine screening for these infections for all pregnant patients. The decision to screen should be based on individual risk factors, symptoms, and local epidemiology.\n\nAdditionally, given that the patient tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago and has no new risk factors mentioned, these tests might not be automatically repeated unless there are specific risk factors or symptoms prompting re-testing, as per current guidelines.\n\nEach patient's situation is unique, and the healthcare provider should use clinical judgment, taking into account the patient's medical history, risk factors, and current guidelines to determine the appropriate tests and screenings.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3 and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for patients with low CD4+ counts due to the risk of fungal infections, particularly cryptococcosis and candidiasis.\n\nIn addition to resuming antiretroviral therapy, the patient should consider taking the following medications:\n\n1. **Fluconazole**: As you mentioned, fluconazole is commonly prescribed for primary prophylaxis against cryptococcal disease and candidiasis in patients with CD4+ counts below 100 cells/mm3.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: This antibiotic is used for primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3.\n3. **Azithromycin**: This antibiotic may be considered for primary prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's depression should also be addressed, as it may be contributing to his non-adherence to ART. Referral to a mental health professional and support services may be beneficial in helping him manage his depression and improve adherence to his treatment regimen.\n\nThe patient's healthcare provider should also consider ordering the following tests:\n\n* Fungal antibody tests (e.g., cryptococcal antigen)\n* Blood cultures for fungal and bacterial infections\n* Sputum and stool tests for opportunistic infections (e.g., PCP, MAC)\n* Imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray, CT scan) to evaluate for signs of opportunistic infections or other complications\n\nBy taking a comprehensive approach to the patient's care, including resuming ART, prescribing prophylactic medications, and addressing his mental health, the healthcare provider can help reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and improve the patient's overall health outcomes.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA). BA is a condition caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe key findings that support this diagnosis include:\n\n* The presence of red papules on the face and trunk, which are characteristic of BA\n* The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which is consistent with BA\n* The patient's immunocompromised state, with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 98/mm3\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is antibiotic treatment. The traditional treatment for BA is erythromycin, but other macrolides such as azithromycin or clarithromycin can also be used.\n\nHowever, the hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, which is not the standard treatment for BA. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are typically used to treat toxoplasmosis, another opportunistic infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients.\n\nGiven the hospital's experience with Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, it is possible that the patient may be at risk for toxoplasmosis, particularly given her low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. However, the clinical presentation and biopsy findings are more consistent with BA.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be erythromycin or another macrolide antibiotic, rather than Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. It is essential to consult with an infectious disease specialist to determine the best course of treatment for this patient.\n\nRecommended treatment:\n* Erythromycin 500 mg orally four times a day for 3-4 months\n* Alternatively, azithromycin 500 mg orally daily for 3-4 months\n\nIt is also essential to address the patient's underlying HIV infection and to provide counseling and support for her substance use disorder.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2.

Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is being treated for HIV with a combination of lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir. Recently, you prescribed a treatment that had pancreatitis as an adverse effect, but it is not explicitly stated what that treatment is. However, given the context of HIV treatment and the mention of pancreatitis, it's reasonable to consider that the treatment in question might be related to the HIV medication regimen, specifically the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like lamivudine and zidovudine, which are known to have a risk of pancreatitis among their side effects.\n\nGiven the information provided and considering the potential for pancreatitis as an adverse effect, the patient is at greatest risk for:\n\n1. **Pancreatitis**: As mentioned, some antiretroviral medications, particularly certain NRTIs, can increase the risk of pancreatitis. This condition involves inflammation of the pancreas and can be severe, requiring immediate medical attention.\n\n2. **Lactic Acidosis and Hepatic Steatosis**: These are also potential side effects of NRTIs, which can lead to an increase in lactic acid levels in the blood and fatty liver disease, respectively.\n\n3. **Lipodystrophy Syndrome**: This includes a range of symptoms such as abnormal fat distribution in the body (e.g., buffalo hump, central obesity, or wasting of the face, arms, and legs), which can be associated with certain antiretroviral therapies, including protease inhibitors like indinavir.\n\n4. **Metabolic Abnormalities**: HIV treatment, especially with certain classes of drugs like protease inhibitors, can lead to metabolic changes, including dyslipidemia (abnormal levels of fats in the blood) and insulin resistance or diabetes.\n\n5. **Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, is known to increase the risk of nephrolithiasis due to its low solubility in urine, which can lead to the formation of kidney stones.\n\nIt's crucial for the patient to be closely monitored for these potential adverse effects and for the healthcare provider to adjust the treatment regimen as necessary to minimize risks while effectively managing the HIV infection.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV infection, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and subsequent immune suppression (indicated by a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 90/\u03bcL), along with the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why this diagnosis is more likely than glioblastoma, despite the recent similar case:\n\n1. **HIV Status and Immunosuppression**: The patient's history of HIV and the low CD4 count suggest significant immunosuppression. PCNSL is known to occur more frequently in immunosuppressed individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. The patient's recent inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy could have exacerbated this immunosuppression.\n\n2. **Clinical Presentation**: The symptoms of headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain, such as PCNSL. However, these symptoms can also be seen in other conditions, including glioblastoma.\n\n3. **MRI Findings**: The solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is more typical of PCNSL in the context of HIV/AIDS. While glioblastoma can also present as a ring-enhancing lesion, the involvement of the corpus callosum and the patient's immunosuppressed state lean more towards PCNSL.\n\n4. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis (increased cell count in the CSF) and the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the CSF are highly suggestive of PCNSL, particularly in an immunosuppressed patient. EBV is associated with a significant proportion of PCNSL cases in HIV-infected individuals.\n\n5. **CD4 Count**: The low CD4 count is a risk factor for opportunistic infections and cancers, including PCNSL. This contrasts with glioblastoma, which does not have a direct association with CD4 count or HIV status.\n\nIn contrast, glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor that can occur in anyone but is not specifically associated with HIV infection or immunosuppression. While it can present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, the specific combination of this patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, and EBV-positive CSF PCR makes PCNSL a more likely diagnosis.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis would typically require a biopsy, but given the clinical context and diagnostic findings, PCNSL is the most probable diagnosis, highlighting the importance of considering the patient's immune status and associated risks when evaluating neurological symptoms.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in management of this infant would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis, regardless of the mother's viral load or antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy.\n\nThe most commonly recommended regimen for newborns is:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, starting as soon as possible after birth (usually within 6-12 hours).\n\nHowever, in some cases, a combination of antiretroviral medications, such as zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, may be considered, especially if the mother's viral load is high or if there are concerns about resistance.\n\nIn this case, since the mother's viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, which is relatively high, and she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, a combination regimen may be considered.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management of this infant would be to:\n\n1. Administer zidovudine (AZT) as soon as possible after birth, and consider adding lamivudine and nevirapine to the regimen, as per the hospital's protocol and in consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist.\n2. Perform a complete blood count (CBC) and differential to monitor for potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy.\n3. Obtain a HIV DNA PCR test at 14-21 days of life to assess for HIV infection.\n4. Provide supportive care, including monitoring for signs of HIV infection, and ensuring the infant receives standard vaccinations and well-child care.\n\nIt's essential to note that the management of this infant should be individualized, and consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist is recommended to determine the best course of treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
