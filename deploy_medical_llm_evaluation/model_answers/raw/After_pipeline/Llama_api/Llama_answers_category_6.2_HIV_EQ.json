    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it appears that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is appropriate for this condition.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is corticosteroids, specifically prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, the more critical additional treatment is the management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe patient's opening pressure of 285 mm H2O is significantly elevated, indicating increased ICP. To manage this, repeated lumbar punctures may be necessary to relieve pressure and prevent complications such as vision loss or brain herniation. The frequency and volume of CSF drainage should be guided by the patient's clinical status and ICP measurements.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of increased ICP, such as papilledema, cranial nerve palsies, or worsening headache, and managed supportively with measures such as elevating the head of the bed, maintaining a quiet environment, and avoiding activities that may exacerbate ICP.\n\nRegarding the mention of Chloramphenicol, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. The patient you previously treated with similar symptoms may have had a different diagnosis, such as bacterial meningitis, for which Chloramphenicol could be an appropriate treatment option. However, for this patient with suspected cryptococcal meningitis, the current treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine is more appropriate.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening test, we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV of a test is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negatives (TN) divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives (FN).\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS = 250\n- Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 240\n- Patients without AIDS = 250\n- Patients without AIDS who tested positive (false positives) = 5\n\nFrom this, we can derive:\n- False negatives (FN) = Total patients with AIDS - Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 250 - 240 = 10\n- True negatives (TN) = Total patients without AIDS - Patients without AIDS who tested positive = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe NPV is calculated as TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nNPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nThis means that approximately 96.08% of the patients who test negative with this novel screening examination do not have AIDS. \n\nThe calculation mentioned in the question, 240 / (240 + 5), actually refers to the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), not the NPV. The PPV is the proportion of individuals with a positive test result who actually have the disease. In this context, it would be the number of true positives (240) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (5), which gives the proportion of individuals who test positive and actually have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis or a focal brain lesion such as toxoplasmosis, is high. However, the patient's specific symptoms of weakness localized to one hand with preserved sensation suggest a focal neurological deficit, which could be indicative of a central nervous system (CNS) lesion or an infectious process affecting the CNS.\n\nThe patient's fever and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) increase the risk for opportunistic infections. The use of itraconazole as empiric treatment in the hospital suggests a consideration for fungal infections, but the primary concern in this patient should be to identify and treat the cause of the focal neurological deficit.\n\nThe next best steps in management would include:\n\n1. **Imaging Studies**: Urgent MRI of the brain with and without contrast to evaluate for focal lesions, such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcomas, or other opportunistic infections, and to rule out stroke or other vascular causes.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: \n   - Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for signs of infection or inflammation.\n   - Blood cultures to evaluate for bacteremia or fungemia.\n   - CD4 count verification and HIV viral load to assess the current state of HIV control.\n   - Toxoplasma IgG antibodies to assess for past exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, a common cause of focal brain lesions in HIV patients.\n   - Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing on serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if available.\n\n3. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: Lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF analysis, including cell count, glucose, protein, culture, and cryptococcal antigen, is crucial in diagnosing CNS infections. However, given the patient's focal neurological deficit, it's essential to perform imaging studies before LP to rule out space-occupying lesions that could lead to brain herniation.\n\n4. **Empiric Treatment**: While awaiting diagnostic results, consider starting empiric treatment for potential opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis (with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine) or cryptococcal disease (with amphotericin B and flucytosine), based on clinical suspicion and local epidemiology. The choice of empiric antifungal therapy might need to be adjusted based on the specific diagnosis and local resistance patterns.\n\n5. **Optimization of ART**: Ensure the patient is on an appropriate and effective ART regimen to improve immune function and reduce the risk of further opportunistic infections.\n\n6. **Supportive Care**: Manage the patient's fever, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia as necessary, and consider consulting with specialists in infectious diseases and neurology for further guidance.\n\nIn summary, while itraconazole may be used in certain fungal infections, the initial approach to this patient should focus on diagnosing the cause of the focal neurological deficit through imaging and laboratory tests, followed by targeted therapy based on those findings.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) or Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, suggest a neurological disorder. The presence of HIV with a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) increases the risk of opportunistic infections and neurological complications.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect are consistent with PML, a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which is an opportunistic infection that occurs in individuals with immunocompromised states, such as HIV/AIDS.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's laboratory results, including a low CD4+ count and high viral load, support the diagnosis of an opportunistic infection. The presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity suggests past exposure to Toxoplasma, but it is not directly related to the current symptoms.\n\nVascular dementia is less likely, given the patient's age, HIV status, and the presence of white matter lesions on MRI, which are not typical of vascular dementia.\n\nHAND is also a possible diagnosis, as it can present with similar symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and behavioral changes. However, the presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI and the patient's low CD4+ count and high viral load make PML a more likely diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, the following tests are recommended:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia, which is common in pregnancy.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: To determine the woman's blood type and Rh status, which can affect the management of the pregnancy.\n3. **Urinalysis**: To check for protein, glucose, and infection.\n4. **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone)**: To screen for hypothyroidism, which is common in pregnancy.\n5. **Rubella immunity**: To confirm immunity to rubella (German measles).\n6. **Varicella immunity**: To confirm immunity to varicella (chickenpox).\n7. **Hepatitis B surface antigen**: To screen for hepatitis B infection.\n8. **HIV testing**: To screen for HIV infection, even if she tested negative 4 years ago, as this is a routine prenatal test.\n9. **Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing**: To screen for these sexually transmitted infections, even if she tested negative 4 years ago, as this is a routine prenatal test.\n10. **Urine culture**: To screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can increase the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy.\n11. **Pap smear**: If she is due for a routine Pap smear, it can be done at this visit.\n12. **Ultrasound**: To confirm the gestational age and viability of the pregnancy.\n\nThe following tests are not routinely recommended at this visit:\n\n* **CMV serology**: While your hospital has been testing for CMV serology, it is not a routine prenatal test. CMV testing is typically only recommended for women who have a history of CMV infection or who are at high risk of infection.\n* **PCR for HSV-2**: This test is not routinely recommended for pregnant women, as it is not a standard prenatal test. However, if the woman has a history of genital herpes or is at high risk of infection, her healthcare provider may recommend this test.\n\nNote: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and other professional organizations provide guidelines for prenatal testing, and these guidelines may vary depending on the patient's individual risk factors and medical history.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. The fact that Fluconazole is often prescribed in such cases hints at the risk of fungal infections, particularly oral or esophageal candidiasis, which are common in individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n\nIn addition to resuming his antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage his HIV infection, this patient should be considered for prophylactic medications to prevent opportunistic infections, given his significantly compromised immune status. The CDC guidelines recommend the following prophylactic measures for individuals with CD4+ counts below certain thresholds:\n\n1. **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis**: This is recommended for patients with a CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm3. The first-line prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\n2. **Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis**: Also recommended for patients with a CD4+ count < 100 cells/mm3, typically with TMP-SMX, which serves as dual prophylaxis for both PCP and toxoplasmosis.\n\n3. **Fluconazole for candidiasis and other fungal infections**: As you mentioned, Fluconazole is often prescribed for patients with low CD4+ counts, especially those with a history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis.\n\nConsidering the patient's CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, he would likely benefit from:\n\n- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** for PCP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis.\n- **Fluconazole** for the prevention of candidiasis, as hinted at in the scenario.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the patient's specific risk factors, geographic location, and exposure history, prophylaxis against other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (if latent TB infection is diagnosed), CMV, or MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex) might be considered. However, these would be based on individual risk assessments and are not as universally recommended at a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3 as PCP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis.\n\nIt's crucial to note that the primary goal is to suppress the HIV virus with effective ART, which will help in recovering the CD4+ count and reducing the risk of opportunistic infections. Alongside ART, these prophylactic measures can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and survival.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), which is caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of this condition.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is antibiotic treatment. The recommended treatment is a 3-month course of erythromycin or doxycycline. \n\nThe use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not appropriate for this condition, as these medications are typically used to treat toxoplasmosis, which is a different opportunistic infection.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be:\n\n* Erythromycin 500 mg orally four times a day for 3 months, or\n* Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 3 months.\n\nIt is also important to note that the patient's HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count put her at risk for other opportunistic infections, and she should be considered for antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for other opportunistic infections as well.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's treatment regimen, which includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Pancreatitis**: As you mentioned, pancreatitis is a known adverse effect of certain antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine, stavudine, and zidovudine. Although the patient is not taking didanosine or stavudine, zidovudine is a component of their treatment regimen, which increases the risk of pancreatitis.\n2. **Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis**: Lamivudine and zidovudine, both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), have been associated with lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by fatty liver.\n3. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis due to its ability to crystallize in the urine.\n4. **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can also cause hyperbilirubinemia, a condition characterized by elevated bilirubin levels, which can lead to jaundice.\n5. **Lipodystrophy**: The patient is at risk of developing lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by abnormal fat distribution, which can be caused by the combination of antiretroviral medications, particularly protease inhibitors like indinavir.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient closely for these potential adverse effects and adjust their treatment regimen if necessary to minimize the risk of these complications.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the current presentation of headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy, along with the laboratory and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV Status and Immunosuppression**: The patient's history of HIV with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL) indicates significant immunosuppression. PCNSL is more common in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n2. **Neurological Symptoms**: The symptoms of headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain, which PCNSL can cause.\n\n3. **Mini-Mental State Examination Score**: A score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment, which is consistent with brain involvement by a tumor.\n\n4. **MRI Findings**: The solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is typical for PCNSL, especially in immunocompromised patients. While glioblastoma can also present as a ring-enhancing lesion, the patient's immunosuppressed state and the specific involvement of the corpus callosum point more towards PCNSL.\n\n5. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis (increased cell count in the CSF) and the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the CSF are highly suggestive of PCNSL in an immunocompromised patient. EBV is associated with a significant proportion of PCNSL cases in HIV-infected individuals.\n\n6. **Distinguishing from Glioblastoma**: While glioblastoma is a consideration for any patient presenting with a brain tumor, the combination of the patient's immunosuppressed state, the specific MRI findings, and the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF makes PCNSL more likely. Glioblastoma would not typically be associated with EBV DNA in the CSF.\n\nIn summary, the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, particularly the detection of EBV DNA in the CSF, strongly support the diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) in this HIV-positive patient with significant immunosuppression.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis. The regimen typically consists of zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, starting as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 6-12 hours.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the mother's viral load is known to be 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, which is not adequately suppressed (< 50-100 copies/mL), the risk of MTCT is higher. Therefore, a combination antiretroviral prophylaxis regimen is recommended.\n\nThe most appropriate next step would be to:\n\n1. Administer zidovudine (AZT) as soon as possible, preferably within 6-12 hours after birth, and continue for 4-6 weeks.\n2. Consider adding other antiretroviral medications, such as lamivudine and/or nevirapine, to the prophylaxis regimen, as you mentioned, based on the mother's antiretroviral therapy regimen and resistance testing, if available.\n3. Perform a complete blood count (CBC) and differential before starting zidovudine to monitor for potential anemia or neutropenia.\n4. Schedule follow-up appointments for the infant to monitor for signs of HIV infection, perform serial HIV testing (e.g., HIV DNA PCR at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months), and adjust the antiretroviral prophylaxis regimen as needed.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a pediatric HIV specialist or an experienced pediatrician to determine the best course of treatment for this infant.",
