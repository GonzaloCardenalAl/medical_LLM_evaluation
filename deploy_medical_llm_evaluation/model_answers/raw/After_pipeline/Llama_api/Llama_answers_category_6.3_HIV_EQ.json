    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it appears that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate for this condition.\n\nGiven the patient's severe symptoms, including severe headache and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) indicated by the opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, additional treatment to manage the elevated ICP may be warranted.\n\nIn the acute setting, repeated lumbar punctures may be necessary to relieve elevated ICP and prevent further complications such as brain herniation. This procedure can help to reduce the pressure and alleviate symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, the patient may benefit from adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, to reduce inflammation and edema.\n\nIt's worth noting that chloramphenicol is not typically used to treat cryptococcal meningitis. The patient you previously treated with chloramphenicol may have had a different condition, such as bacterial meningitis.\n\nIn summary, the additional treatment in the acute setting may include:\n\n* Repeated lumbar punctures to manage elevated ICP\n* Adjunctive corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and edema\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust treatment as needed to ensure the best possible outcome.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV of a test is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negatives (TN) divided by the sum of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN).\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with AIDS (confirmed cases) = 250\n- Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 240\n- Patients without AIDS (controls) = 250\n- Patients without AIDS who tested positive (false positives) = 5\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- False negatives (FN) = Total patients with AIDS - Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 250 - 240 = 10\n- True negatives (TN) = Total patients without AIDS - Patients without AIDS who tested positive = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe NPV formula is: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nSubstituting the values: NPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nCalculating the value: NPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel test is approximately 96.08%. This means that about 96.08% of the patients who test negative for AIDS using this novel screening examination actually do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness of his right hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection or a neurological condition related to his immunocompromised state is high. The patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications is a concern, as this could lead to a progression of his HIV disease and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.\n\nThe neurological findings of 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation suggest a focal neurological deficit. In a patient with HIV, especially with a low CD4 count, conditions such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and CNS lymphoma must be considered. However, the presentation of focal weakness, particularly if acute, might also suggest a stroke, which could be ischemic or hemorrhagic in nature. Given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as a family history of cardiovascular disease, a vascular cause cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe use of empiric treatment with itraconazole at the hospital suggests a consideration for fungal infections, which are more common in immunocompromised patients. However, itraconazole would be more appropriate for conditions like cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis rather than an initial treatment for focal neurological deficits without clear evidence of a fungal infection.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient would involve the following:\n\n1. **Immediate Imaging**: A CT scan of the head should be performed to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, and if CT is negative for hemorrhage, consider proceeding with an MRI of the brain to evaluate for ischemic stroke, toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, or other opportunistic infections.\n\n2. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If the imaging does not show a clear cause for the patient's symptoms (e.g., ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), a lumbar puncture should be considered to evaluate for cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or other infections. The LP can provide CSF for culture, PCR for various pathogens, and cytology.\n\n3. **Blood Work**: Complete blood count (CBC), blood cultures, and electrolyte panels should be drawn. Additionally, consideration should be given to checking the patient's CD4 count, HIV viral load, and toxoplasma IgG antibodies.\n\n4. **Neurological Consultation**: Consultation with a neurologist, preferably one with experience in HIV-related neurological conditions, would be beneficial in guiding further management and diagnostic testing.\n\n5. **Adherence to ART and Supportive Care**: Ensuring the patient is on appropriate and adherent ART is crucial, as well as managing his other comorbid conditions like hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n\n6. **Empiric Treatment**: While awaiting diagnostic results, empiric treatment might be considered based on the suspected diagnosis. For example, if toxoplasmosis is suspected, empiric treatment with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine could be initiated. However, the choice of empiric treatment should be guided by the clinical presentation and likelihood of specific infections.\n\nIn summary, the next best step involves a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including imaging and potentially a lumbar puncture, along with consideration of empiric treatment based on clinical suspicion and the patient's immunocompromised state. Consulting with specialists in neurology and infectious diseases would be beneficial in guiding the patient's care.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) or more specifically, given the severity of symptoms, HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD).\n\nThe key points that lead to this diagnosis include:\n\n1. **HIV infection with a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL):** This indicates poorly controlled HIV infection, which is a risk factor for HAND/HAD.\n\n2. **Neurological symptoms:** The patient presents with a range of cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms, including forgetfulness, getting lost in familiar places, difficulties with operating appliances, paranoia, agitation, restlessness, right leg weakness, and unsteady gait. These symptoms are consistent with the diagnosis of HAD, which can manifest with cognitive, motor, and behavioral abnormalities.\n\n3. **Laboratory findings:** While the patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which could contribute to vascular dementia, the presence of a low CD4+ count, high viral load, and specific neurological findings are more indicative of HAD.\n\n4. **MRI findings:** The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI is consistent with HAD. These lesions are often seen in the brains of individuals with HIV infection and are associated with the pathogenesis of HAND/HAD.\n\n5. **Somnolence and confusion:** These are also common in advanced stages of HAD, reflecting significant brain involvement.\n\n6. **Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity:** While this indicates past exposure to Toxoplasma, the clinical presentation and imaging findings do not specifically suggest an active toxoplasmosis infection as the primary cause of his symptoms. Toxoplasmosis typically presents with focal neurological deficits and mass effect on imaging, which is not described here.\n\nVascular dementia, on the other hand, is typically associated with a history of vascular risk factors (which this patient has, such as hypertension and diabetes), stepwise decline in cognitive function, and evidence of vascular disease on imaging, such as lacunar infarcts or white matter hyperintensities consistent with small vessel disease. While it's possible for this patient to have some degree of vascular cognitive impairment given his medical history, the overall clinical picture, including the severity of cognitive and motor symptoms, the low CD4+ count, high viral load, and characteristic MRI findings, points more strongly towards a diagnosis of HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD).",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Based on the information provided and current prenatal care guidelines, the following tests should be considered for this 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and other blood abnormalities.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor:** Determining the blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh factor (Rh positive or Rh negative) is crucial for identifying potential incompatibilities between the mother's and the fetus's blood types.\n3. **Rubella Immunity:** Although she mentions her vaccinations are up-to-date, confirming rubella immunity is standard practice to prevent congenital rubella syndrome.\n4. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):** Screening for hepatitis B is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n5. **HIV Testing:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, the CDC recommends HIV screening for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, regardless of previous test results, due to the potential for new exposures.\n6. **Syphilis Screening:** Screening for syphilis is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n7. **Urine Culture:** To check for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and potentially affect the pregnancy.\n8. **Pap Smear:** If she is due for a routine Pap smear according to her screening schedule, it can be performed during this visit.\n9. **Glucose Screening:** Although the primary glucose screening typically occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, some practices may do an initial screen earlier, especially if risk factors are present.\n10. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening:** This is usually performed between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation but is not part of the initial visit tests.\n\nRegarding the specific tests mentioned for your hospital:\n\n- **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** Screening for thyroid dysfunction is recommended for all pregnant women, especially during the first trimester, as untreated thyroid conditions can affect the pregnancy.\n- **CMV Serology:** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening is not universally recommended for all pregnant women but may be considered in certain situations, such as if the woman works in a high-risk profession (e.g., childcare) or if there are concerns about exposure.\n- **PCR for HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2):** Routine screening for HSV-2 is not recommended for all pregnant women. However, type-specific serologic tests may be offered to women who are unsure of their HSV status and have a history of genital herpes or whose partner has genital herpes.\n\nIt's essential to note that the specific tests performed may vary depending on the patient's medical history, risk factors, and the recommendations of her healthcare provider or the hospital's protocols.",

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for patients with low CD4+ counts to prevent opportunistic fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis and candidiasis.\n\nIn addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the patient should consider taking the following medications:\n\n1. **Fluconazole**: As you mentioned, this is often prescribed to prevent opportunistic fungal infections, particularly cryptococcosis and candidiasis.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: This antibiotic is commonly used to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n3. **Azithromycin**: This antibiotic may be prescribed to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is another opportunistic infection that can occur in individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's depression should also be addressed, as it may be contributing to his non-adherence to ART. The patient should be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment of his depression.\n\nThe patient's ART regimen should be reassessed, and a new regimen may be prescribed if necessary. The goal is to achieve viral suppression, improve the patient's CD4+ count, and reduce the risk of opportunistic infections.\n\nIn summary, the patient should take:\n\n* Fluconazole to prevent opportunistic fungal infections\n* Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to prevent PCP\n* Azithromycin to prevent MAC infection\n* Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to achieve viral suppression and improve his CD4+ count\n* Medications to treat his depression, as prescribed by a mental health professional.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), which is caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of BA.\n\nGiven the patient's severely immunocompromised state (CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 98/mm3), it is essential to initiate treatment promptly.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is erythromycin. The recommended treatment is oral erythromycin 500 mg four times a day for at least 3 months.\n\nThe use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which is mentioned in the scenario, is not the first-line treatment for BA. These medications are typically used to treat Toxoplasmosis, which is another opportunistic infection that can occur in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's history of intravenous drug use and smoking, as well as her HIV status and low CD4+ count, put her at risk for various opportunistic infections. However, based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, erythromycin is the most appropriate treatment for Bacillary Angiomatosis.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the recent improvement in adherence, along with the specific neurological symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is not Glioblastoma, which was the diagnosis for the patient with similar symptoms. Instead, the combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results points towards a diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV Status and Immunosuppression**: The patient's history of HIV and the fact that he had been inconsistent with his antiretroviral therapy until recently suggest a period of immunosuppression. This makes him more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancers, including PCNSL.\n\n2. **Neurological Symptoms**: Symptoms such as headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain, which could be a tumor.\n\n3. **Mini-Mental State Examination Score**: A score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment, which can be seen in various brain pathologies, including PCNSL.\n\n4. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL) indicates immunosuppression, which is a risk factor for PCNSL. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is particularly telling, as EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients.\n\n5. **Imaging**: A solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the brain, especially one involving the corpus callosum, is suggestive of PCNSL, particularly in the context of immunosuppression. While the description could also fit other diagnoses like toxoplasmosis, the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF and the specific clinical context make PCNSL more likely.\n\n6. **Comparison with Glioblastoma**: While both conditions can present with similar symptoms due to the mass effect of the tumor, the specific combination of immunosuppression, EBV positivity in CSF, and the radiological appearance of a ring-enhancing lesion makes PCNSL more likely in this case than glioblastoma, which is a primary brain cancer not typically associated with EBV or specifically with immunosuppression due to HIV.\n\nIn summary, the patient's clinical presentation, recent history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy adherence, laboratory findings (especially the low CD4 count and presence of EBV DNA in CSF), and the characteristic imaging features are most consistent with a diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.\n\nThe most frequently recommended regimen for infants born to HIV-positive mothers is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy, not the combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the following:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy: Administer zidovudine to the infant orally, starting as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 6-12 hours. The typical dose is 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours for 4-6 weeks.\n\nThe use of zidovudine monotherapy is based on the landmark Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 076 study, which demonstrated a significant reduction in MTCT of HIV with zidovudine administration to the mother during pregnancy and labor, and to the infant after birth.\n\nWhile lamivudine and nevirapine are antiretroviral medications used in combination therapy for HIV treatment, they are not typically used as part of the standard prophylaxis regimen for newborns in this context.\n\nIn addition to administering zidovudine, the following steps are also important:\n\n* HIV testing: Perform HIV antibody testing on the infant at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age. HIV PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or viral culture can be performed at birth, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months to detect early infection.\n* Follow-up care: Ensure the infant receives regular follow-up care with a pediatrician experienced in caring for HIV-exposed infants, including monitoring for signs of HIV infection and other complications.\n\nIt is essential to note that the management of HIV-exposed infants may vary depending on the specific clinical scenario and institutional guidelines. Consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist or an expert in HIV care may be helpful in determining the best course of action.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
