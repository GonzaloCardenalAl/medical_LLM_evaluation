    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and lumbar puncture results, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis. In addition to IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, the patient may also benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, the most immediate concern is managing the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). \n\nRepeated lumbar punctures to relieve elevated ICP and decrease the opening pressure may be warranted in the acute setting to prevent further neurological deterioration.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know:\n\n- True Negatives (TN): Patients without AIDS who test negative (250 - 5 = 245)\n- False Negatives (FN): Patients with AIDS who test negative (250 - 240 = 10)\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 (or 96.1%)\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that about 96.1% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's HIV status with a low CD4 count and symptoms of sudden weakness, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection (OI) or a neurological complication. The next best step is to perform a thorough diagnostic workup, including:\n\n1. MRI of the brain to rule out opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) or other conditions (e.g., stroke).\n2. Lumbar puncture to examine cerebrospinal fluid for infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis) or inflammation.\n\nAdditionally, optimize the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and consider consulting an infectious disease specialist for further guidance.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) with a possible opportunistic infection or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), but given the non-enhancing white matter lesions and low CD4 count, PML is more likely. However, the definitive diagnosis of PML requires JC virus detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain biopsy.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Antidepressant medication**: Such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine or sertraline to manage his depression.\n2. **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis**: Since his CD4+ count is below 200 cells/mm3, he is at risk for opportunistic infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is commonly used for PCP prophylaxis.\n\nThese medications should be taken in addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to manage his HIV infection. Close monitoring and counseling on adherence are also crucial.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."
