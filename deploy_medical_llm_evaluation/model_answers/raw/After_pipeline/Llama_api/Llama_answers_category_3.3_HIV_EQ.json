    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as PCNSL is often associated with EBV in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, a more commonly used medication that targets gp41 is not typically used as a first-line treatment. A more likely answer in this context would be that no medication is immediately started that targets gp41, but rather the patient would likely start a regimen including medications from other classes such as NRTIs, NNRTIs, or Integrase inhibitors, with gp41-targeting medications like Enfuvirtide being considered in specific cases, such as treatment-experienced patients or those with resistance to other medications.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the molecular process that could be impaired is denaturation of proteins and degradation of vitamins, particularly Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a heat-labile vitamin, meaning it can be inactivated or broken down when exposed to high temperatures, leading to a loss of its nutritional value.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, didanosine is the likely culprit as it's known to increase the risk of pancreatitis. To prevent recurrence, didanosine should be discontinued and replaced with an alternative antiretroviral medication. The patient can likely continue with zidovudine and efavirenz.",

    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "In patients with latent HIV-1, DNA methylation profiles often show hypermethylation of the HIV-1 promoter region, which helps suppress viral transcription. In contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with hypomethylation of the same region, allowing for increased viral replication. Additionally, global DNA methylation changes have been observed in HIV-1 infected individuals, affecting host gene expression and potentially contributing to disease progression.",
    "true_answer": "I searched for your question and found some relevant results. According to these results, **DNA methylation** is a possible mechanism that regulates the **latency** and **reactivation** of **HIV-1 provirus** in infected cells  . However, the **methylation profiles** of HIV-1 proviral DNA may vary depending on the **disease progression**, **antiretroviral therapy**, and **cell type** of the patients ."
