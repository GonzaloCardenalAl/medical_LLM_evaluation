    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is typically diagnosed through a combination of:\n\n1. **Rapid tests**: Finger prick or oral swab tests that detect antibodies against HIV.\n2. **Blood tests**: Laboratory tests that detect antibodies (e.g., ELISA) or the virus itself (e.g., PCR).\n3. **Confirmatory tests**: Western blot or repeat testing to confirm initial results.\n\nA diagnosis is usually made if a person tests positive on two separate tests.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "There are 3 main stages of HIV: \n\n1. **Acute HIV Infection**: The initial stage, typically within 2-4 weeks of infection, where the virus replicates rapidly.\n2. **Chronic HIV Infection** (also known as asymptomatic HIV): The virus is still active, but the immune system keeps it under control, often without symptoms.\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: The most advanced stage, where the immune system is severely weakened, making the person susceptible to opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

  {
    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is primarily transmitted through:\n\n1. Unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with an infected person.\n2. Sharing needles or syringes with someone who has HIV.\n3. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding (without proper prevention measures).\n4. Blood transfusions from an infected donor (rare in countries with strict blood screening).\n\nThese are the main modes of transmission. Let me know if you have any further questions!",
    "true_answer": "HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through:\n\n1. **Safe sex**: Using condoms correctly and consistently.\n2. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Taking daily medication for high-risk individuals.\n3. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Taking medication within 72 hours of potential exposure.\n4. **Avoiding sharing needles**: Using sterile needles for injecting drugs.\n5. **Getting tested regularly**: Knowing your status and taking precautions.\n\nThese methods can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) typically needs to be taken daily, with most regimens requiring once-daily or twice-daily dosing. Adherence to the prescribed schedule is crucial to maintain viral suppression and prevent drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Provide ART to the HIV-positive mother during pregnancy, which reduces the viral load.\n2. **Prenatal care**: Regular prenatal check-ups to monitor the mother's health and adjust treatment as needed.\n3. **Elective cesarean section**: Consider elective C-section before the onset of labor and before the rupture of membranes, if the mother's viral load is not well-controlled.\n4. **Avoid breastfeeding**: HIV-positive mothers should avoid breastfeeding to prevent postnatal transmission.\n5. **Antiretroviral prophylaxis**: Administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn after birth.\n\nThese steps can significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch from latent to active HIV infection is triggered by various factors, including:\n\n1. **Cell activation**: Latent HIV-infected cells can be reactivated when the cell receives an activation signal, such as an immune response to another infection.\n2. **Cytokine stimulation**: Cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 can stimulate latent HIV-infected cells to produce viral particles.\n3. **Epigenetic changes**: Modifications to the viral genome or host chromatin can reactivate latent HIV.\n\nThese factors can lead to the reactivation of latent HIV, resulting in active viral replication and potentially causing symptoms or detectable viremia.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
