    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, individuals who were diagnosed with HIV at a younger age (before 20) tend to have a slower CD4 decline compared to those diagnosed at an older age (after 20). This suggests that the time taken for the CD4 count to drop below 200 is longer for those tested before the age of 20.",
