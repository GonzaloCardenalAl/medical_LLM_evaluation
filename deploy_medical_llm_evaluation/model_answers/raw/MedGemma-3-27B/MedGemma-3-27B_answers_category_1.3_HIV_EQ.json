    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed using a combination of laboratory tests.\n\n1.  **Antibody Tests:** These look for antibodies your immune system makes in response to HIV. Examples include rapid tests (finger prick or oral fluid) and laboratory-based tests (blood draw).\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These look for both HIV antibodies and a specific HIV antigen called p24. Antigen/antibody tests can detect HIV infection earlier than antibody-only tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look for the virus itself in the blood. NATs are typically used when there's a high suspicion of recent infection or to confirm positive results from other tests.\n\nOften, a rapid antibody test is done first. If positive, it's confirmed with a more specific lab test like an antigen/antibody test or a NAT.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the stages of HIV infection. It's generally categorized into three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2-4 weeks after infection. Symptoms can be flu-like (fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers). Viral load is very high, making transmission risk high.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** The virus is still active but reproduces at low levels. People may not have symptoms or only mild ones. Without treatment, this stage can last for many years (average 10 years), but the virus gradually weakens the immune system. Viral load is lower than in the acute stage, but transmission is still possible.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when the immune system is badly damaged, typically when the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or when certain opportunistic infections or cancers develop. Symptoms are severe and include rapid weight loss, recurring fever, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, chronic diarrhea, fatigue, sores of the mouth, throat, and genitals, pneumonia, neurological disorders, and certain cancers.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV can stay in the chronic stage for decades and never progress to AIDS. ART can also reduce the viral load to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is transmitted through specific bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.\n\nTransmission occurs when these fluids from a person with HIV enter the body of someone who doesn't have HIV. This can happen through:\n\n*   **Sexual contact:** Anal, vaginal, or oral sex with someone who has HIV.\n*   **Sharing needles or syringes:** Primarily for injection drug use.\n*   **Mother-to-child:** During pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n*   **Accidental needlestick injuries:** In healthcare settings.\n*   **Blood transfusions or organ transplants:** (Rare in countries with effective screening).\n\nIt's important to note that HIV is **not** transmitted through casual contact like hugging, sharing utensils, or using the same toilet.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby."

  {
    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "Common comorbidities in people living with HIV include:\n\n*   **Cardiovascular disease:** Heart attack, stroke, heart failure.\n*   **Kidney disease:** Chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease.\n*   **Liver disease:** Hepatitis B or C coinfection, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis.\n*   **Bone disease:** Osteoporosis, osteopenia.\n*   **Neurological disorders:** Neurocognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Cancers:** Certain cancers like Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, anal cancer, cervical cancer.\n*   **Mental health conditions:** Depression, anxiety, substance use disorders.\n*   **Infectious diseases:** Tuberculosis, pneumonia, opportunistic infections (especially if HIV is poorly controlled).",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV prevention involves several strategies:\n\n1.  **Condom Use:** Consistent and correct use of latex or polyurethane condoms significantly reduces transmission risk during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\n2.  **PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis):** Taking a daily pill (or receiving long-acting injections) can prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at high risk.\n3.  **PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis):** Taking HIV medication within 72 hours of a potential exposure can prevent infection.\n4.  **Treatment as Prevention (TasP):** People with HIV who take their antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed and achieve an undetectable viral load cannot sexually transmit HIV to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).\n5.  **Needle Exchange Programs:** Providing sterile needles reduces HIV transmission among people who inject drugs.\n6.  **Testing and Counseling:** Regular HIV testing allows for early diagnosis and linkage to care, preventing further transmission.\n7.  **Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission:** HIV-positive pregnant individuals taking ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their baby.\n8.  **Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision:** Circumcision can reduce the risk of female-to-male sexual transmission in high-prevalence areas.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's address this question about ART frequency.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV needs to be taken **every day**, without missing doses.\n\nConsistency is crucial for the medication to work effectively, suppress the virus, and prevent the development of drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

  {
    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the key strategies for preventing perinatal HIV transmission (mother-to-child transmission, or MTCT).\n\n1.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for the Mother:** This is the most critical step. The mother should be on effective ART throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and ideally continue it long-term for her own health. The goal is to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load.\n2.  **Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for the Infant:** The newborn receives HIV medication for a period after birth (usually 4-6 weeks, sometimes longer depending on risk factors).\n3.  **Mode of Delivery:** Cesarean section (C-section) is often recommended if the mother's viral load is not suppressed near delivery, to reduce the infant's exposure during birth. Vaginal delivery is generally safe if the viral load is undetectable.\n4.  **Infant Feeding:** In settings where safe alternatives are available, formula feeding is recommended to eliminate the risk of transmission through breast milk. If breastfeeding is necessary or chosen, the mother must be on effective ART with viral suppression, and the infant should receive prophylaxis.\n5.  **Early Diagnosis and Treatment of HIV in the Infant:** Testing the infant for HIV early and starting treatment immediately if positive is crucial.\n\nThese combined strategies have dramatically reduced MTCT rates.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV primarily infects cells that express the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (usually CCR5 or CXCR4) on their surface.\n\nThe main cell types infected are:\n\n1.  **CD4+ T lymphocytes (T helper cells):** These are the primary target cells. Their depletion is a hallmark of HIV infection and leads to immunodeficiency.\n2.  **Macrophages:** These cells can also be infected and serve as a reservoir for the virus.\n3.  **Dendritic cells:** These cells can capture the virus and transmit it to T cells.\n\nOther cells like microglia (in the brain) and certain epithelial cells can also be infected, but to a lesser extent.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "That's a fundamental question. Here's the key difference:\n\n*   **HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)** is the *virus* itself. It attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells).\n*   **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)** is the *late stage* of HIV infection. It's a syndrome, meaning a collection of symptoms and illnesses, that occurs when the immune system is severely damaged by HIV.\n\nEssentially, you can have HIV without having AIDS, but you cannot have AIDS without having HIV. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count drops below a certain level (typically 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or when specific opportunistic infections develop.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is **not** transmitted through:\n\n*   **Casual contact:** Shaking hands, hugging, sharing toilets, sharing dishes/utensils.\n*   **Air or water:** Coughing, sneezing, swimming pools.\n*   **Insects:** Mosquitoes, ticks.\n*   **Saliva, tears, or sweat:** Unless visibly mixed with blood.\n\nTransmission requires direct contact with specific body fluids (blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, breast milk) from an HIV-positive person, entering the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the switch between latent and active HIV infection.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Latent Reservoir:** HIV can hide in a dormant state within certain immune cells (primarily resting CD4+ T cells, but also macrophages and monocytes). This is called the latent reservoir. In this state, the virus isn't actively replicating and isn't targeted by the immune system or antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n2.  **Active Infection:** This is when the virus is actively replicating, producing new virions, and causing immune system damage. This is the state targeted by ART.\n3.  **The \"Switch\" (Viral Reactivation):** This is the process where latent HIV becomes active again. It's not a simple on/off switch, but rather a complex process.\n\n**What triggers reactivation?**\n\n*   **Immune Activation:** Strong immune stimulation (e.g., from other infections, inflammation, certain cancers) is a major trigger. When immune cells become activated, the latent virus can also be activated.\n*   **Cytokines:** Specific signaling molecules (cytokines) like IL-15, TNF-alpha, and IL-7 can stimulate HIV reactivation.\n*   **Cellular Factors:** Certain cellular processes and transcription factors within the infected cell can influence reactivation.\n*   **ART Interruption:** Stopping ART allows the virus to replicate freely, but it can also potentially lead to reactivation of latent virus.\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n*   **Viral Persistence:** The latent reservoir is the main barrier to curing HIV. Even with effective ART suppressing active replication, the latent virus remains.\n*   **Rebound:** If ART is stopped, the reactivated latent virus can quickly lead to a rapid increase in viral load and disease progression.\n*   **Therapeutic Target:** Understanding the reactivation process is crucial for developing strategies (like \"shock and kill\") aimed at eliminating the latent reservoir.\n\n**In short:** Reactivation occurs when stimuli (often immune-related) cause the latent virus within resting cells to start replicating again. This process is complex and involves multiple cellular and molecular factors. It's a major hurdle in achieving an HIV cure.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
