    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed using a combination of methods, primarily blood tests.\n\n1.  **Antibody Tests:** These look for antibodies your immune system makes in response to HIV. They can be done via blood draw or oral fluid. Rapid antibody tests provide results in about 30 minutes, while lab-based tests take a few days.\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests (4th Generation):** These look for both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen (part of the virus itself). The p24 antigen appears earlier than antibodies, allowing for earlier detection. These are usually blood tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look directly for the virus's genetic material (RNA) in the blood. NATs are the most expensive and are typically used when someone has had a recent high-risk exposure or has symptoms of acute HIV infection.\n\nA positive result on an initial test is always confirmed with a second, different type of test.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV infection typically progresses through three stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Many people experience flu-like symptoms. The virus is highly active and easily transmissible during this stage.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** The virus continues to replicate but at lower levels. People may not have symptoms for many years, but the virus is still active and can be transmitted. With treatment, people can stay in this stage for decades.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. The immune system is severely damaged, leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers. This stage occurs when the CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or when certain AIDS-defining illnesses develop.\n\nIt's important to note that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people with HIV never progress to AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is transmitted through specific bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.\n\nTransmission typically occurs when these fluids from a person with HIV enter the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person. Common routes include unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral), sharing needles or syringes, and from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n\nIt is important to note that HIV is *not* transmitted through casual contact like hugging, kissing, sharing utensils, or using the same toilet.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down common comorbidities in people living with HIV.\n\nPeople living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk for several conditions, often due to chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and the effects of the virus itself, even when well-controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n**Common comorbidities include:**\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular Disease:** Heart attack, stroke, peripheral vascular disease.\n2.  **Kidney Disease:** Chronic kidney disease, HIV-associated nephropathy.\n3.  **Liver Disease:** Hepatitis B or C co-infection, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis.\n4.  **Certain Cancers:** Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, anal cancer, lung cancer.\n5.  **Neurological Conditions:** Neurocognitive impairment (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or HAND), peripheral neuropathy.\n6.  **Bone Disease:** Osteoporosis, osteopenia.\n7.  **Mental Health Conditions:** Depression, anxiety, substance use disorders.\n8.  **Infectious Diseases:** Tuberculosis, pneumonia, opportunistic infections (especially if HIV is not well-controlled).\n\nIt's crucial to screen for and manage these conditions proactively in all PLWH.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down HIV prevention. Here are the key strategies:\n\n1.  **Condom Use:** Consistent and correct use of latex or polyurethane condoms significantly reduces the risk of transmission during sexual activity.\n2.  **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Daily medication (usually a combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine) taken by HIV-negative individuals at high risk can prevent infection.\n3.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Antiretroviral medications taken within 72 hours of a potential exposure can prevent infection.\n4.  **Treatment as Prevention (TasP):** People with HIV who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load on antiretroviral therapy cannot sexually transmit the virus to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, or U=U).\n5.  **Harm Reduction:** For people who inject drugs, using sterile needles and syringes prevents HIV transmission. Needle exchange programs are crucial.\n6.  **Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC):** Circumcision reduces the risk of female-to-male sexual transmission in high-prevalence settings.\n7.  **Testing and Counseling:** Regular HIV testing allows for early diagnosis and linkage to care, preventing further transmission. Counseling helps individuals understand their risk and prevention options.\n8.  **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):** Antiretroviral therapy for pregnant individuals with HIV drastically reduces the risk of transmission to their infants during pregnancy, labor, and breastfeeding.\n\nThese are the main evidence-based methods. Let me know if you'd like more detail on any specific one.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "For most people living with HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken **every day**, usually once daily.\n\nConsistency is crucial for ART to be effective. Missing doses can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down how we prevent perinatal HIV transmission. It's a multi-pronged approach, focusing on the mother, the baby, and the delivery process.\n\n1.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for the Mother:** This is the most crucial step. Starting ART as early as possible during pregnancy, continuing through pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, dramatically reduces the viral load, often to undetectable levels. This significantly lowers the risk of transmission.\n2.  **Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for the Infant:** The baby receives ART medication shortly after birth and continues for several weeks (typically 4-6 weeks, sometimes longer depending on risk factors).\n3.  **Mode of Delivery:** Cesarean section (C-section) before labor begins and before rupture of membranes is recommended for women with a detectable viral load near delivery to further reduce transmission risk. For women with undetectable viral loads, vaginal delivery is generally considered safe.\n4.  **Infant Feeding:** In high-income settings where safe alternatives are available, formula feeding is recommended to eliminate the risk of transmission through breast milk. In resource-limited settings, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks, and exclusive breastfeeding for a shorter duration (e.g., 6 months) while the mother is on ART might be recommended, along with careful counseling.\n5.  **Maternal Viral Load Monitoring:** Regularly monitoring the mother's viral load throughout pregnancy is essential to ensure ART is effective and to guide delivery decisions.\n\nEssentially, the goal is to keep the mother's viral load as low as possible, protect the infant with medication, and choose the safest delivery method based on viral load status.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV primarily infects cells that express the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (usually CCR5 or CXCR4) on their surface.\n\nThe main cell types infected are:\n1.  **CD4+ T lymphocytes (T helper cells):** These are the primary target and their depletion is a hallmark of HIV infection, leading to immunodeficiency.\n2.  **Macrophages:** These phagocytic cells are also infected and can act as a reservoir for the virus.\n3.  **Dendritic cells:** These antigen-presenting cells can be infected and facilitate viral transmission.\n\nOther cells like microglia in the brain and certain epithelial cells can also be infected, but to a lesser extent.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "That's a great question to start with.\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus itself. It attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells).\n\nAIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. It's a syndrome, meaning a collection of symptoms and illnesses, that occurs when the immune system is severely damaged by HIV.\n\nEssentially, you have HIV first, and if left untreated, it can progress to AIDS. With treatment, people with HIV can live long, healthy lives and may never develop AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's clarify HIV transmission. HIV is *not* transmitted through:\n\n*   **Air or water**\n*   **Insects like mosquitoes or ticks**\n*   **Saliva, sweat, tears, or urine** (unless visibly contaminated with blood)\n*   **Casual contact** like hugging, shaking hands, sharing toilets, or sharing dishes.\n\nEssentially, it requires direct contact with specific body fluids (blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, breast milk) from an infected person, typically through broken skin, mucous membranes, or direct injection.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the switch from latent to active HIV infection.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1.  **Latency:** HIV can hide in a dormant state (latent) within certain immune cells, primarily CD4+ T cells. In this state, the virus isn't actively replicating and isn't detectable by standard tests.\n2.  **Reactivation:** This latency isn't permanent. Various factors can trigger the virus to \"wake up\" and start replicating again (reactivation).\n3.  **Triggers:** Common triggers for reactivation include:\n    *   Immune system activation (e.g., due to other infections, inflammation)\n    *   Certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids)\n    *   Stress\n    *   Changes in immune status (e.g., starting or stopping antiretroviral therapy - ART)\n4.  **Mechanism:** The exact molecular switch isn't fully understood, but it involves changes in gene expression within the latently infected cell, allowing the virus to transition from a dormant to a replicative state.\n5.  **Clinical Significance:** Reactivation can lead to increased viral load, potential damage to the immune system, and increased risk of transmission. This is why consistent ART is crucial \u2013 it suppresses viral replication and reduces the frequency and magnitude of reactivation events.\n\n**In short:** Latent HIV isn't gone, just dormant. Various triggers can cause it to reactivate and start replicating, leading to active infection. Understanding these triggers and the mechanisms of reactivation is a major focus of HIV research.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
