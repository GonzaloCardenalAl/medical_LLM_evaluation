    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "That's an interesting question about the early days of HIV treatment.\n\nIn 1990, the landscape of HIV treatment was very different. There were only a few approved drugs, and treatment strategies were limited. The five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland (and globally) in 1990 were likely:\n\n1.  **Zidovudine (AZT)**: This was the first approved drug and the cornerstone of therapy.\n2.  **Didanosine (ddI)**: Often used in combination with AZT.\n3.  **Lamivudine (3TC)**: Approved in 1990, quickly became a common component of regimens.\n4.  **Foscarnet**: Used primarily for CMV retinitis but also had some activity against HIV, especially in AZT-resistant cases.\n5.  **Interferon-alpha**: While not a direct antiretroviral, it was used in some protocols to try and boost the immune system.\n\nIt's important to remember that these drugs had significant side effects, and the effectiveness of these early regimens was limited compared to modern combination therapies.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "Yes, there was a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010. Women with HIV had a lower birth rate compared to women without HIV.\n\nThis difference is likely due to several factors, including:\n\n*   **Later age at diagnosis:** Women with HIV are often diagnosed later in life, when their fertility may already be declining.\n*   **Health concerns:** Some women with HIV may be concerned about the health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth.\n*   **Socioeconomic factors:** Women with HIV may face socioeconomic challenges that can impact their decision to have children.\n*   **Access to care:** Access to comprehensive HIV care, including family planning services, can influence birth rates.\n\nIt is important to note that with advances in HIV treatment, women with HIV can now have healthy pregnancies and babies. The birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland has been increasing in recent years, but it still remains lower than that of women without HIV.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a difference.\n\nWomen living with HIV in Switzerland had a lower birth rate in 2020 compared to women without HIV. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including delayed childbearing, effective contraception use, and the potential impact of HIV treatment on fertility.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that women living with HIV who do choose to have children can do so safely with appropriate medical care. Advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "The most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland is unprotected sexual intercourse, primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM).",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "That's a good question about treatment adherence in Switzerland.\n\nBased on available data, studies indicate that approximately **15-20%** of visits to HIV clinics in Switzerland involve patients reporting missed doses at least once in the past month.\n\nIt's important to remember that this is based on *self-reported* adherence, which can sometimes be an underestimation of actual missed doses. However, it gives a useful estimate of the scale of the issue.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "That's a specific question about stigma and mental health in a particular population.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have the exact proportion of People Living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland who reported feeling guilty about having HIV as of 2020.\n\nThis type of data often comes from specific surveys or studies on HIV-related stigma and psychosocial well-being, and it might not be readily available in general statistics. You would likely need to consult research publications or reports from Swiss public health authorities or HIV organizations (like the Swiss Federal Commission for HIV/AIDS) to find that specific figure.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."

  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can help with that.\n\nBased on the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) data from 2020, approximately **16%** of people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland reported feeling treated like outcasts.\n\nThis indicates that while stigma has decreased significantly over the years, it still remains a concern for a notable minority.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific question about mortality data in Switzerland. Unfortunately, I don't have that exact statistic readily available. \n\nHIV mortality data is typically collected and reported in aggregate, often focusing on overall trends, causes of death, and risk factors, rather than specific age-at-diagnosis breakdowns for those who died from HIV-related causes.\n\nTo find this information, you would likely need to consult:\n\n1.  **Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO):** They collect and publish mortality statistics.\n2.  **Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS):** This long-term study has extensive data on HIV-positive individuals in Switzerland, including mortality. Researchers associated with the SHCS might have access to this specific breakdown.\n3.  **Published research articles:** Look for studies specifically analyzing HIV mortality trends in Switzerland, potentially focusing on age demographics.\n\nIt's possible this data exists within one of these sources, but it's not a commonly cited statistic.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down this question.\n\n**Here's my assessment:**\n\nThis question is asking about a specific subgroup of people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland (diagnosed 1990-2010, initial CD4 > 300) and whether their age at diagnosis (before vs. after 20) impacts how quickly their CD4 count declines to below 200.\n\n**My answer:**\n\nYes, there is likely a difference. Generally, individuals diagnosed with HIV at a younger age tend to experience a faster decline in CD4 cell count compared to those diagnosed later in life, even if their initial CD4 count was high. This is thought to be related to the longer duration of untreated viral replication and immune activation in younger individuals.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Data Specificity:** While this is a general principle, specific data from Switzerland for this exact cohort (1990-2010, initial CD4 > 300, age at diagnosis) would be needed to confirm the magnitude and statistical significance of this difference.\n*   **Other Factors:** Many other factors influence CD4 decline, including viral load, access to care, adherence to treatment, co-infections, and genetics.\n*   **Treatment Era:** The period 1990-2010 spans the pre-HAART, early HAART, and more established HAART eras. Access to and timing of effective treatment significantly impacts CD4 trajectory.\n\n**In summary:** While a difference is expected based on general HIV progression patterns, specific Swiss cohort data would provide a definitive answer.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
