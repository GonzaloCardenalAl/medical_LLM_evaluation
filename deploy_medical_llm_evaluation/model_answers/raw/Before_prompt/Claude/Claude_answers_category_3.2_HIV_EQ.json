    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n1. Patient profile:\n- HIV-positive with CD4+ count <100/\u03bcL (severe immunosuppression)\n- Middle-aged woman\n\n2. Clinical presentation:\n- Headaches\n- Blurred vision\n- Confusion\n- Ataxia\n- Memory impairment\n\n3. Diagnostic findings:\n- CSF positive for EBV DNA (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n- Lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF\n- MRI showing solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients (CD4+ count <50/\u03bcL). Nearly all cases of AIDS-related PCNSL are associated with EBV infection. The MRI finding of a weakly ring-enhancing lesion crossing the corpus callosum is characteristic of PCNSL, as opposed to toxoplasmosis which typically shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions and rarely crosses the corpus callosum.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit, thereby blocking the conformational changes necessary for viral fusion with the host cell membrane.\n\nKey points about Enfuvirtide:\n- It is administered subcutaneously twice daily\n- Used in combination therapy for treatment-experienced patients\n- Main side effects include injection site reactions\n- It's typically reserved for salvage therapy due to its route of administration and cost",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "The molecular process that could be impaired by overheating formula is Vitamin C's (ascorbic acid) role in collagen synthesis, specifically in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues to form hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine in collagen molecules.\n\nHere's the detailed process:\n1. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase enzymes\n2. These enzymes add hydroxyl (-OH) groups to proline and lysine amino acids\n3. The hydroxylation is essential for:\n- Proper collagen triple helix formation\n- Collagen stability\n- Cross-linking between collagen molecules\n\nOverheating formula can denature Vitamin C, leading to impaired collagen synthesis which is crucial for:\n- Proper growth and development\n- Wound healing\n- Blood vessel formation\n- Connective tissue strength\n\nTherefore, proper formula preparation is essential to maintain optimal Vitamin C levels and ensure normal collagen synthesis in the infant.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "After resolving acute pancreatitis in this HIV-positive patient, the key medication consideration would be to discontinue didanosine (ddI) and avoid its future use. Here's the detailed explanation:\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. Cause of Pancreatitis:\n- Didanosine is known to cause pancreatitis as a serious adverse effect\n- The risk is dose-dependent and can be life-threatening\n- Risk increases when combined with other medications that can affect the pancreas\n\n2. Required Medication Changes:\n- Discontinue didanosine permanently\n- Replace it with another antiretroviral drug from a different class or a different NRTI\n- Continue zidovudine and efavirenz if they were well-tolerated\n\n3. Future Considerations:\n- Avoid other medications known to cause pancreatitis\n- Monitor pancreatic enzymes regularly\n- Consider risk factors for pancreatitis (alcohol use, gallstones, etc.)\n\n4. Alternative HIV Regimen:\n- Work with an HIV specialist to design a new effective combination therapy\n- Consider newer antiretroviral options with better safety profiles\n\nRemember: Once a patient develops didanosine-induced pancreatitis, the drug should never be reintroduced due to the risk of recurrence with potentially more severe consequences.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target for the physician scientist's antibody design would be gp120, which is a glycoprotein component of the HIV envelope.\n\nHere's why:\n1. gp120 is a surface protein located on the viral envelope, making it easily accessible to antibodies\n2. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors on host cells\n3. It's highly immunogenic and is one of the main targets of natural antibody responses\n4. Being on the surface makes it a prime target for neutralizing antibodies that could prevent viral entry\n5. It's one of the proteins commonly used in HIV diagnostic tests (ELISA and Western blot)\n\nThe fact that the question mentions envelope proteins and diagnostic tests points to gp120 as the most logical target, as it's both accessible and functionally important for viral infection.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus. This is a case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which commonly affects immunocompromised patients like those with HIV/AIDS. The key diagnostic features are:\n\n1. Patient factors:\n- Immunocompromised state (HIV-positive)\n- Adult patient\n\n2. Clinical presentation:\n- Fever\n- Hemoptysis\n- Cavitary lung lesion\n\n3. Microscopic findings:\n- Septate hyphae\n- Acute angle (45\u00b0) branching\nThese microscopic features are characteristic of Aspergillus species and help distinguish it from other fungi like Mucor (which has non-septate hyphae with right-angle branching).\n\nAspergillus fumigatus is the most common species causing invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's medication regimen puts him at greatest risk for bone marrow suppression, particularly neutropenia and anemia. This is because:\n\n1. Valganciclovir commonly causes bone marrow suppression\n2. Zidovudine (AZT), which the patient is already taking, also has bone marrow suppression as a major side effect\n\nThe combination of these two drugs can have an additive or synergistic effect on bone marrow suppression, leading to:\n- Increased risk of neutropenia\n- Worsening anemia\n- Potential thrombocytopenia\n\nThis requires careful monitoring of the patient's complete blood count and may necessitate dose adjustments or discontinuation of one of the medications if severe cytopenias develop.\n\nThe patient may already be showing signs of anemia (pallor noted on exam), which could be exacerbated by this drug combination.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection in the newborn would be HIV DNA PCR testing. Here's why:\n\nKey points:\n1) Maternal antibodies cross the placenta and persist in the newborn for up to 18 months, making HIV antibody tests unreliable in newborns.\n\n2) HIV DNA PCR can directly detect viral genetic material, rather than relying on antibody detection.\n\nTesting recommendations:\n- First test: Within 48 hours of birth\n- Second test: At 14-21 days of age\n- Third test: At 1-2 months\n- Additional test: At 4-6 months\n\nFor a definitive negative result:\n- At least 2 negative PCR tests, with one after 4 months of age are needed\n- Some guidelines recommend testing until 18 months to completely rule out infection\n\nPrevention measures for this patient:\n1) Start antiretroviral therapy immediately\n2) Plan for cesarean delivery if viral load >1000 copies/mL\n3) Provide antiretroviral prophylaxis to newborn after birth\n4) Avoid breastfeeding\n\nHIV DNA PCR is the gold standard for early infant diagnosis of HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."
