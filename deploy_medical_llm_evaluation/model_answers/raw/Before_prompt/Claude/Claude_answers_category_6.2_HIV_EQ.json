    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "In this case of suspected Cryptococcal meningitis in an AIDS patient (given the clinical presentation, CSF findings, and initiated treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine), the patient needs measures to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe key finding is the elevated opening pressure of 285 mm H2O (normal is <200 mm H2O). High ICP can lead to serious complications including visual loss and death if not addressed.\n\nAdditional treatment should include:\n\n1. Therapeutic lumbar punctures\n- Should be performed to reduce opening pressure by 50% if initial pressure is \u2265250 mm H2O\n- May need to be repeated daily until pressure normalizes and symptoms improve\n- Goal is to maintain opening pressure <200 mm H2O\n\n2. Consider acetazolamide or other diuretics if repeated lumbar punctures are insufficient\n\n3. In severe cases with very high ICP:\n- CSF shunting may be necessary\n- Temporary lumbar drain placement might be considered\n\nThe case mentioned with chloramphenicol was likely bacterial meningitis, which is a different entity requiring different management approaches.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "Let me help you calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nNPV is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly doesn't have the disease.\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the data:\n* True Positives (TP) = 240 (AIDS patients who tested positive)\n* False Positives (FP) = 5 (non-AIDS patients who tested positive)\n* True Negatives (TN) = 245 (non-AIDS patients who tested negative) [250 - 5 = 245]\n* False Negatives (FN) = 10 (AIDS patients who tested negative) [250 - 240 = 10]\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245/255 = 0.961 = 96.1%\n\nThe NPV is 96.1%\n\nNote: What you described as \"doctors diagnose this as 240/(240+5)\" is actually the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) calculation.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given this patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain an urgent MRI of the brain with and without contrast.\n\nKey points in this case:\n1. Acute onset right hand weakness\n2. HIV positive with low CD4 count (<200 cells/mm\u00b3)\n3. Fever\n4. Poor medication adherence\n5. History of opportunistic infection (previous pneumonia)\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes:\n1. Toxoplasmosis (most common CNS opportunistic infection in HIV)\n2. Primary CNS lymphoma\n3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n4. Acute stroke\n5. Brain abscess\n\nRationale for MRI:\n- Will help differentiate between the possible causes\n- Can show characteristic ring-enhancing lesions of toxoplasmosis\n- Can demonstrate mass lesions of CNS lymphoma\n- Can show white matter changes characteristic of PML\n- Can identify ischemic changes if stroke\n\nAfter imaging, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis should be initiated if ring-enhancing lesions are found, given it's the most common CNS opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4 <100. Standard treatment would include pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine and leucovorin, not itraconazole.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should be counseled about medication adherence and restarting his antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and test results, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD), not vascular dementia. Here's why:\n\nKey supporting evidence:\n1. Patient has advanced HIV disease:\n- Very low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL)\n- High viral load (>100,000 copies/mL)\n- Poor medication compliance\n- Lymphadenopathy\n\n2. Characteristic neurological symptoms:\n- Progressive cognitive decline\n- Memory problems\n- Visuospatial difficulties\n- Behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation)\n- Motor symptoms (gait problems, weakness)\n\n3. MRI findings:\n- Disseminated white matter lesions\n- Non-enhancing lesions\n- No mass effect (helps rule out other conditions like toxoplasmosis or lymphoma)\n\n4. Age and progression:\n- Relatively young age (44) for vascular dementia\n- Subacute progression of symptoms\n\nWhile vascular dementia might be considered due to his hypertension and diabetes, the patient's age, HIV status, and clinical presentation are much more consistent with HIV-Associated Dementia. The condition is treatable with antiretroviral therapy, making early diagnosis and treatment crucial.\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Starting or optimizing antiretroviral therapy\n2. Managing other medical conditions\n3. Providing supportive care\n4. Ensuring medication compliance",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "For this HIV-positive patient with a CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm3 (specifically 33 cells/mm3), prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is indicated:\n\nPrimary prophylaxis should include:\n\n1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis:\n- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX/Bactrim)\n\n2. Since CD4+ count is < 50 cells/mm3:\n- Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis with Azithromycin\n- Fluconazole for cryptococcal infection prophylaxis\n\n3. Consider prophylaxis against:\n- Toxoplasmosis (covered by TMP-SMX)\n- Histoplasmosis in endemic areas\n\nThe patient should also restart antiretroviral therapy immediately under close monitoring to prevent immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n\nThe goal is to prevent opportunistic infections while the patient's immune system recovers with antiretroviral therapy. Once CD4+ counts improve to appropriate levels, prophylaxis can be discontinued.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and findings, this patient most likely has Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL). Here's the reasoning:\n\nKey findings supporting this diagnosis:\n\n1. Patient characteristics and risk factors:\n- HIV-positive with poor medication compliance\n- Very low CD4+ count (90/\u03bcL), indicating severe immunosuppression\n- Recent restart of antiretroviral therapy\n\n2. Imaging findings:\n- Single ring-enhancing lesion\n- Large size (4.5 cm)\n- Location in corpus callosum\n\n3. CSF findings:\n- Positive EBV DNA PCR (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n- Mild pleocytosis\n\n4. Clinical presentation:\n- Neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo)\n- Personality changes\n- Cognitive decline (low MMSE score)\n- Ataxia\n\nWhile Glioblastoma can present similarly, in an HIV-positive patient with:\n- Very low CD4 count\n- EBV positive CSF\n- Recent restart of antiretroviral therapy\nThe most likely diagnosis is PCNSL.\n\nPCNSL in HIV patients is strongly associated with EBV infection and typically occurs when CD4 counts are very low (<50-100/\u03bcL). The patient's recent restart of antiretroviral therapy might have unmasked the lymphoma as part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n\nTreatment would typically involve:\n- Continued antiretroviral therapy\n- High-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy\n- Consideration of radiation therapy",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this HIV-exposed newborn is to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP) as soon as possible, ideally within 6-12 hours of birth.\n\nRationale:\n1. The infant is at risk for HIV infection due to maternal HIV status\n2. The mother's viral load was detectable (>50 copies/mL), indicating increased transmission risk\n3. Early initiation of combination antiretroviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of perinatal HIV transmission\n\nAdditional important management points:\n1. The antiretroviral prophylaxis should be continued for 6 weeks\n2. HIV testing should be performed at:\n   - Birth (HIV DNA PCR)\n   - 2 weeks\n   - 2-3 months\n   - 4-6 months\n3. The infant should not receive breast milk\n4. Regular follow-up to monitor for medication side effects and growth\n5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis should be considered if HIV status remains indeterminate\n\nThe goal is to prevent perinatal HIV transmission while monitoring the infant's HIV status until a definitive diagnosis can be made.",
