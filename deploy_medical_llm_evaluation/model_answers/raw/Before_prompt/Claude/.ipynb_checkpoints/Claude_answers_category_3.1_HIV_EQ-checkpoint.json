    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "Enfuvirtide (T-20) acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering CD4+ T cells by binding to the gp41 subunit and blocking the conformational changes necessary for viral membrane fusion with the host cell membrane. Enfuvirtide is typically used in combination with other antiretroviral medications in treatment-experienced patients with HIV infection who have evidence of viral replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, overheating formula could impair the Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) dependent collagen synthesis pathway. Here's why this is important:\n\nKey points:\n1. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis as a cofactor\n2. It acts as a reducing agent/electron donor for enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase\n3. These enzymes hydroxylate proline and lysine residues in procollagen\n4. This hydroxylation is crucial for:\n- Formation of stable triple helical structure\n- Cross-linking of collagen fibers\n- Overall collagen stability\n\nWithout adequate Vitamin C:\n- Collagen synthesis would be impaired\n- Resulting collagen would be unstable\n- Could lead to poor wound healing\n- Could affect connective tissue development\n\nThis is why maintaining proper Vitamin C levels through correctly prepared formula is important for the infant's development.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "In this case, the medication regimen needs to be modified due to the development of acute pancreatitis, which is likely due to didanosine (ddI). Here's the key information and recommended precautions:\n\nKey Points:\n1. Didanosine is known to cause pancreatitis as a serious adverse effect\n2. Pancreatitis is a contraindication to continued didanosine use\n3. The HIV treatment regimen needs to be modified while maintaining effective antiretroviral therapy\n\nRequired Precautions:\n1. Discontinue didanosine permanently\n- Didanosine should not be restarted due to risk of recurrent pancreatitis\n- History of didanosine-induced pancreatitis is an absolute contraindication to future use\n\n2. Select alternative antiretroviral drug\n- Replace didanosine with another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)\n- Choice should be based on:\n  * Resistance testing\n  * Patient tolerability\n  * Drug interactions\n  * Current guidelines\n\n3. Monitor closely for:\n- Recurrence of pancreatitis symptoms\n- Side effects of new medication\n- HIV viral load and CD4 count to ensure treatment efficacy\n\n4. Patient education about:\n- Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis\n- Importance of medication adherence\n- Need for regular follow-up\n- Avoiding alcohol and other pancreatic irritants",

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target for the antibody would be gp120, which is a glycoprotein component of the HIV envelope protein complex.\n\nExplanation:\n1. gp120 is one of the main envelope proteins of HIV and is present on the surface of the virus particle.\n2. It plays a crucial role in viral entry by binding to CD4 receptors on host cells.\n3. gp120 is highly immunogenic and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies produced during natural infection.\n4. Since it's exposed on the virus surface, it's accessible to antibodies.\n5. Targeting gp120 could potentially prevent viral entry into cells.\n\nOther HIV proteins like p24 (capsid protein) are internal structural proteins and would not be as effective targets for neutralizing antibodies since they are not exposed on the virus surface. The physician scientist would likely focus on gp120 because:\n- It's accessible to antibodies\n- It's essential for viral infection\n- It's already a natural target of the immune system\n- Blocking it could prevent viral entry",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current medication regimen puts him at greatest risk for bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia and anemia) because:\n\n1. Valganciclovir commonly causes bone marrow suppression as a side effect\n2. Zidovudine (AZT), which is part of his current antiretroviral regimen, also commonly causes bone marrow suppression\n\nThe combination of these two medications creates an additive risk for:\n- Neutropenia\n- Anemia\n- Thrombocytopenia\n\nThis is particularly significant because:\n- Both drugs independently affect blood cell production\n- HIV infection itself can affect bone marrow function\n- The patient is already showing signs of illness that may affect his overall health status\n\nTherefore, close monitoring of complete blood counts would be necessary while this patient is on both medications.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection in the newborn would be HIV DNA PCR testing. Here's why:\n\nKey Points:\n1) Maternal HIV antibodies cross the placenta and persist in the infant's circulation for up to 18 months after birth, making standard HIV antibody tests unreliable in newborns.\n\n2) HIV DNA PCR testing can directly detect the presence of viral genetic material, rather than relying on antibody detection.\n\n3) HIV DNA PCR can be performed as early as 14-21 days after birth and should be repeated at 1-2 months and 4-6 months of age.\n\n4) A diagnosis of HIV infection can be made with two positive DNA PCR tests from separate blood samples.\n\n5) HIV DNA PCR has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting HIV infection in infants.\n\nImportant Additional Information:\n- The mother should be started on antiretroviral therapy immediately to reduce the risk of vertical transmission\n- Cesarean delivery should be considered depending on viral load\n- The infant should receive prophylactic antiretroviral medication after birth\n- Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-positive mothers in developed countries where safe alternatives are available",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."
