Common Testing Methods:\n- Rapid tests (finger prick)\n- Laboratory blood tests\n- At-home testing kits\n- Oral swab tests\n\n4. Confirmatory Testing:\n- Positive screening tests are confirmed with follow-up tests\n- Western blot or immunofluorescence assay\n- RNA tests for very early detection\n\n5. Testing Locations:\n- Doctor's offices\n- Health clinics\n- Sexual health centers\n- Many community organizations\n- Some pharmacies\n\nRegular testing is recommended for:\n- Sexually active individuals\n- People with multiple partners\n- Those who share injection drug equipment\n- Healthcare workers with potential exposure\n\nEarly diagnosis allows for:\n- Prompt treatment initiation\n- Better health outcomes\n- Reduced transmission risk to others",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several methods:\n\n1. Safe Sex Practices:\n- Using condoms correctly during sexual activity\n- Getting regularly tested for HIV and other STIs\n- Being monogamous with an uninfected partner\n- Abstaining from sexual activity\n\n2. Medical Prevention:\n- PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) for people at high risk\n- PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) within 72 hours of potential exposure\n- Prevention of mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding\n\n3. Avoiding Blood Contact:\n- Not sharing needles or other drug injection equipment\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n- Screening blood products before transfusion\n\n4. Healthcare Settings:\n- Following universal precautions\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n- Proper disposal of contaminated materials\n\n5. Education:\n- Learning about HIV transmission\n- Getting tested regularly\n- Discussing HIV status with sexual partners\n- Understanding risk factors\n\nRemember that combining multiple prevention methods provides the best protection against HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) medications must be taken daily, exactly as prescribed. Most modern ART regimens involve taking pills once per day at the same time each day. Strict adherence to the prescribed schedule is crucial because:\n\n1. Missing doses can lead to drug resistance\n2. Consistent drug levels are needed to suppress HIV\n3. Irregular dosing can reduce treatment effectiveness\n4. Most current regimens are designed for daily dosing\n\nSome patients may have specific regimens requiring twice-daily dosing, but once-daily treatments are more common with newer medications. It's essential to follow the healthcare provider's instructions precisely and maintain at least 95% adherence to the prescribed schedule for optimal treatment outcomes.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV primarily infects CD4+ T lymphocytes (T helper cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. CD4+ T cells are the main target, as the virus uses the CD4 receptor and chemokine co-receptors (mainly CCR5 or CXCR4) to enter these cells. The infection and destruction of CD4+ T cells leads to the progressive immune system deterioration characteristic of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."
