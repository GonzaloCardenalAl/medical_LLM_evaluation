    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the presentation and lab results, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, particularly those with low CD4 counts. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nGiven the high opening pressure on lumbar puncture (285 mm H2O), this patient may be at risk for complications related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as vision loss or even death. In addition to antifungal treatment, management of elevated ICP is crucial in the acute setting.\n\nAdditional treatment that may be warranted in this patient includes:\n\n1. **Repeated lumbar punctures**: To relieve elevated ICP and prevent further complications. This may need to be performed daily or as often as necessary to maintain an opening pressure below 250 mm H2O.\n2. **Corticosteroids**: Not typically used in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but may be considered in cases with severe increased ICP or vision loss.\n3. **Acetazolamide**: A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can help reduce CSF production and decrease ICP.\n4. **Monitoring for vision changes**: Regular ophthalmologic exams to assess for vision changes or signs of increased ICP, such as papilledema.\n\nThe mention of Chloramphenicol in the prompt is likely a distractor, as it is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn summary, the additional treatment in the acute setting may include repeated lumbar punctures, corticosteroids, acetazolamide, and monitoring for vision changes to manage elevated ICP and prevent complications.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV of a test is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negatives (people without the disease who test negative) divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives (people with the disease who test negative).\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS = 250\n- Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 240\n- Patients with AIDS who tested negative (false negatives) = 250 - 240 = 10\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n- Patients without AIDS who tested positive (false positives) = 5\n- Patients without AIDS who tested negative (true negatives) = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe NPV formula is: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\n\nCalculating the NPV:\nNPV = 245 / 255\n\nNPV \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of the patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis or a focal brain infection, is high. However, the patient's symptoms and signs, such as weakness localized to one hand with preserved sensation, suggest a focal neurological deficit which could be consistent with a variety of conditions including stroke, an infectious process like cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or even a space-occupying lesion.\n\nThe next best step in management would involve several key actions:\n\n1. **Immediate Neuroimaging**: Given the acute onset of focal neurological deficits, an urgent MRI of the brain (with and without contrast) would be crucial to identify any structural abnormalities, such as infarcts, masses, or abscesses. This would help differentiate between various potential causes, including vascular events, infections, or neoplastic processes.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: \n   - **CD4 Count and HIV Viral Load**: Although the patient's CD4 count is known, verifying it and checking the HIV viral load can provide insights into the patient's current immune status and potential for opportunistic infections.\n   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC), Blood Cultures, and Electrolyte Panel**: To assess for signs of infection, inflammation, or electrolyte imbalances that could contribute to the patient's condition.\n   - **Toxoplasma Serology**: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, testing for Toxoplasma gondii antibodies (IgG) can help in diagnosing cerebral toxoplasmosis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts.\n\n3. **Empiric Treatment Adjustment**: While the hospital has been using itraconazole empirically, the patient's presentation does not directly suggest a fungal infection as the primary concern without further diagnostic evidence. Empiric treatment should be guided by the suspected diagnosis. For example, if cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected based on imaging and serology, empiric treatment with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine (with leucovorin) would be appropriate. If there's a high suspicion of cryptococcal infection, empiric treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine should be considered.\n\n4. **Neurological Consultation**: Consulting with a neurologist, preferably one with experience in caring for HIV patients, can provide valuable insights into the management of this patient, especially in interpreting neuroimaging and guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\n5. **Adherence to HIV Medications**: Ensuring the patient's adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial. Poor adherence can lead to a low CD4 count and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. The patient should be counseled on the importance of adherence, and strategies to improve it should be discussed.\n\nIn summary, the immediate next steps should focus on diagnostic clarification through neuroimaging and laboratory tests, followed by tailored empiric treatment based on the suspected diagnosis, and ensuring optimal management of the patient's HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) or Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as forgetfulness, disorientation, difficulty with daily activities, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, are consistent with a neurocognitive disorder. The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, which are characteristic of demyelination, suggests a diagnosis of PML. PML is a rare and often fatal disease caused by the JC virus, which is more common in individuals with immunocompromised states, such as those with advanced HIV infection.\n\nThe patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) indicate advanced HIV disease, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including PML. The patient's history of noncompliance with medications and lack of recent medical follow-up also suggests a high likelihood of untreated or undertreated HIV infection.\n\nVascular dementia is less likely in this case, given the patient's age, lack of history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI, which are not typical of vascular dementia.\n\nOther possible diagnoses to consider include:\n\n* Toxoplasmosis: Although the patient is Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive, the absence of mass effect on MRI and the presence of disseminated white matter lesions make this diagnosis less likely.\n* Cryptococcal meningitis: The negative cryptococcal antigen test makes this diagnosis less likely.\n* HIV-associated dementia: This diagnosis is possible, but the presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI suggests a more specific diagnosis, such as PML.\n\nA definitive diagnosis of PML would require a brain biopsy or detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, based on the information provided, PML is the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Based on the information provided and current prenatal care guidelines, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor:** Determining the blood type and Rh factor is crucial for identifying potential incompatibilities between the mother's and the fetus's blood, which could lead to complications.\n3. **Rubella Antibody Screening:** To assess immunity to rubella (German measles), which can cause serious birth defects if contracted during pregnancy.\n4. **Varicella (Chickenpox) Immunity:** Checking for immunity to varicella to advise on preventive measures if the patient is not immune.\n5. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):** To screen for hepatitis B infection, which can be transmitted to the newborn.\n6. **HIV Screening:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend HIV screening at the first prenatal visit unless the patient declines.\n7. **Syphilis Screening:** Screening for syphilis is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n8. **Urine Culture:** To check for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to urinary tract infections and potentially affect the pregnancy.\n9. **Pap Smear (if due):** Depending on her last Pap smear result and her screening history, a Pap smear might be recommended at this visit.\n10. **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** As your hospital has been testing for this, it's to assess thyroid function, which is important during pregnancy.\n11. **CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Serology:** Since your hospital has been performing this test, it's to determine the patient's immune status regarding CMV, a common virus that can cause serious illness in newborns if contracted during pregnancy.\n12. **PCR for HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2):** Given that your hospital has a protocol for this test, it's aimed at identifying HSV-2 infection, which can have implications for pregnancy management and newborn care.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note the following:\n- **Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening:** These tests are typically recommended for all pregnant women under the age of 25, regardless of risk factors, at the first prenatal visit. Given the patient's age (25 years), the decision to screen might depend on her individual risk factors and local prevalence rates.\n- **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening:** This is usually performed between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation, not at the first visit.\n\nThe specific tests ordered may vary based on local guidelines, the patient's individual risk factors, and her preferences after counseling.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of non-adherence to HIV medication and his current low CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for patients with low CD4+ counts to prevent fungal infections, particularly oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.\n\nIn addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the patient should also be considered for the following medications:\n\n1. **Fluconazole (as mentioned)**: To prevent candidiasis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n2. **Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: To prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a life-threatening opportunistic infection.\n3. **Azithromycin or other macrolides**: To prevent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which can cause disseminated disease in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nThe patient should also be screened for other opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, and treated accordingly.\n\nIt's essential to address the patient's depression, as it is a significant factor in his non-adherence to HIV medication. The patient should be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment of his depression.\n\nRegular follow-up appointments and monitoring of his CD4+ count, viral load, and overall health will be crucial in managing his HIV infection and preventing further complications.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana.\n\nThe key findings that support this diagnosis include:\n\n1. Skin lesions: The patient has multiple red papules on her face and trunk, which are characteristic of BA.\n2. Biopsy results: The biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which is consistent with BA.\n3. Immunosuppression: The patient has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (98/mm3), which increases her susceptibility to opportunistic infections like BA.\n4. Risk factors: The patient's history of intravenous drug use and HIV infection increases her risk of developing BA.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is erythromycin. However, considering the patient's potential interactions and contraindications, the alternative treatment options should be considered.\n\nThe hospital's current treatment protocol using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not the first-line treatment for BA. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are typically used to treat toxoplasmosis, another opportunistic infection that can occur in HIV-infected patients.\n\nThe recommended treatment for BA is:\n\n* Erythromycin (500 mg orally four times a day) for at least 3 months\n* Alternatively, doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day) or azithromycin (500 mg orally once a day) can be used\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count require concurrent management with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve her immune function and reduce the risk of opportunistic infections.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV status and immune suppression**: The patient has a history of HIV and has been inconsistent with his antiretroviral therapy, which suggests immune suppression. PCNSL is a common opportunistic malignancy in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4+ T-cell counts.\n2. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, are consistent with a brain tumor or mass lesion.\n3. ** Imaging findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, which is a characteristic feature of PCNSL.\n4. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV.\n5. **CD4+ T-cell count**: The patient's low CD4+ T-cell count (90/\u03bcL) increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n\nWhile Glioblastoma is a possible diagnosis for a brain tumor, the patient's HIV status, low CD4+ T-cell count, and EBV-positive cerebrospinal fluid analysis make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis in this case.\n\nIt's worth noting that PCNSL can be differentiated from other brain tumors, such as Glioblastoma, by its characteristic imaging features, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and clinical presentation. A definitive diagnosis of PCNSL typically requires a biopsy or histopathological examination of the tumor tissue.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the following:\n\n1. Administer zidovudine (AZT) to the newborn as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 6 hours. The typical dose is 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours for 4-6 weeks.\n2. In addition to zidovudine, consider administering other antiretroviral medications, such as lamivudine and/or nevirapine, based on the mother's antiretroviral regimen and the infant's gestational age and weight.\n3. Perform a complete blood count (CBC) and differential at birth and at 4 weeks to monitor for potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy.\n4. Obtain an HIV DNA PCR test at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months to assess for HIV infection.\n5. Provide counseling and support to the mother regarding infant feeding, with exclusive formula feeding recommended in settings where safe and feasible.\n\nIn this case, since the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and had a viral load of 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, the risk of MTCT is lower, but still present. Therefore, initiating antiretroviral prophylaxis with zidovudine, and possibly other medications, is crucial to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant.\n\nThe mother's viral load, although not undetectable, is relatively low, which suggests that the antiretroviral therapy was effective in reducing the viral load. However, this does not eliminate the need for antiretroviral prophylaxis in the infant, as the risk of MTCT is still present.\n\nBy initiating antiretroviral prophylaxis and monitoring the infant's HIV status through regular testing, healthcare providers can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission and ensure the best possible outcome for the infant.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
