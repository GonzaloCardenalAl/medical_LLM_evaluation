    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV infection and low CD4+ count**: The patient's immunocompromised state increases her risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, blurred vision, confusion, ataxia, and memory impairment, are consistent with a brain lesion.\n3. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis suggests a lymphoid malignancy or infection. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, which is a common cause of PCNSL in immunocompromised patients, further supports this diagnosis.\n4. **MRI findings**: The solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum is consistent with PCNSL. The lesion's location and appearance are typical for this type of tumor.\n5. **Association with EBV**: The detection of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid is a strong indicator of PCNSL, as EBV is associated with a significant proportion of PCNSL cases in immunocompromised patients.\n\nWhile other diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), are possible in an HIV-infected patient with a brain lesion, the combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings points towards PCNSL as the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, this is not typically a first-line treatment for HIV and is usually used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.\n\nA more commonly used medication that targets the gp41 subunit is not typically used as a first-line treatment. However, one medication that comes to mind that targets the HIV envelope is Enfuvirtide's mechanism of action is similar to that of a newer drug, but the one that comes to mind that targets the HIV envelope and is more commonly used is a drug that targets the CD4 receptor, but another drug comes to mind that targets the gp41 subunit indirectly.\n\nThe gp41 subunit is part of the HIV envelope, and one class of medications that targets the HIV envelope is the attachment inhibitors, but another class of medications that targets the HIV envelope and the gp41 subunit indirectly is the fusion inhibitors, and one medication that targets the gp41 subunit is indeed Enfuvirtide, but another medication that targets the HIV envelope is not the one, however, one medication that comes to mind is a fusion inhibitor that targets the gp41 subunit indirectly.\n\nThe answer is Enfuvirtide (T-20), which is a fusion inhibitor that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the molecular process that could be impaired is denaturation of proteins and degradation of vitamins, particularly Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). However, the most relevant process in this context is the degradation of Vitamin C.\n\nVitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is sensitive to heat, water, and oxygen. When formula is boiled for an extended period, the heat can cause the degradation of Vitamin C through a process called hydrolysis and oxidation. Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which a molecule is cleaved into two parts using water. In the case of Vitamin C, hydrolysis can break the molecule into smaller, inactive compounds.\n\nAdditionally, heat can also lead to the oxidation of Vitamin C, which involves the loss of electrons and the formation of reactive oxygen species. This can further contribute to the degradation of Vitamin C, making it unavailable to the infant.\n\nAs a result, if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the Vitamin C content may be reduced or inactivated, which could impair the infant's ability to absorb this essential nutrient. Vitamin C is important for various bodily functions, including immune function, collagen synthesis, and iron absorption. Therefore, it is essential to follow proper preparation and handling procedures for formula to preserve the nutritional value, including Vitamin C.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the patient was started on combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz for HIV. However, she developed acute pancreatitis, which is a known side effect of certain antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine.\n\nDidanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis. To prevent future episodes of pancreatitis, it would be necessary to modify her antiretroviral regimen.\n\nAfter the pancreatitis resolves with treatment, precautions in her medication will be required, specifically:\n\n1. **Discontinuation of didanosine**: Due to its association with pancreatitis, didanosine should be discontinued to minimize the risk of recurrent pancreatitis.\n2. **Alternative antiretroviral regimen**: A new antiretroviral regimen should be initiated, using alternative medications that are not associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis. This may include other NRTIs, such as tenofovir or abacavir, in combination with other classes of antiretroviral agents, such as protease inhibitors or integrase strand transfer inhibitors.\n3. **Monitoring for signs of pancreatitis**: The patient should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and laboratory tests should be performed regularly to check for elevated pancreatic enzymes.\n\nBy modifying her antiretroviral regimen and discontinuing didanosine, the risk of recurrent pancreatitis can be minimized, and the patient can continue to receive effective treatment for her HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The HIV envelope proteins that are targeted by the natural humoral immune response are the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. These proteins are embedded in the viral envelope and are responsible for viral entry into host cells.\n\nGp120 is the surface glycoprotein that binds to the CD4 receptor on host cells, while gp41 is the transmembrane glycoprotein that facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n\nThe antibodies produced by the natural humoral immune response, which are detected by ELISA and western blot assays, are primarily directed against these envelope proteins, particularly gp120.\n\nTherefore, the most likely target of the new antibody being designed by the physician scientist is **gp120**. This protein is a key component of the HIV envelope and is a major target of the natural humoral immune response, making it a prime candidate for the development of a new, more potent antibody.\n\nNote: gp41 is also a potential target, but gp120 is generally considered the more immunodominant protein and is often the primary target of antibody-based therapies.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely causal organism is Aspergillus.\n\nThe key findings that point to Aspergillus are:\n\n1. Fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe: This type of lesion is consistent with an Aspergillus infection, particularly in an immunocompromised patient such as an HIV-positive individual.\n2. Septate hyphae that branch at acute angles: This is a characteristic microscopic feature of Aspergillus. The septate hyphae are typically 2.5-5 \u03bcm in diameter and branch at 45-degree angles, forming a \"V\" shape.\n\nAspergillus is a common opportunistic pathogen that can cause a range of diseases in immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-positive patients. The presentation of fever and hemoptysis, along with the radiographic and biopsy findings, is consistent with invasive aspergillosis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection.\n\nOther possibilities, such as Mucorales (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus) or other fungal pathogens, can be considered, but the combination of clinical and microscopic findings makes Aspergillus the most likely causal organism in this case.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to the patient's current medication regimen puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, particularly **neutropenia** and **anemia**.\n\nValganciclovir is a nucleoside analog that can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased production of blood cells, including neutrophils, red blood cells, and platelets. Zidovudine, a component of the patient's antiretroviral therapy, is also known to cause bone marrow suppression, particularly neutropenia and anemia.\n\nThe concomitant use of valganciclovir and zidovudine can increase the risk of these hematologic adverse effects due to their overlapping toxicities. Therefore, the patient's complete blood count (CBC) should be closely monitored while on this combination therapy to minimize the risk of severe hematologic adverse effects.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient is already showing signs of anemia (pallor) and dehydration (dry mucous membranes), which may be exacerbated by the addition of valganciclovir. Close monitoring and potential dose adjustments or addition of supportive care (e.g., growth factor support) may be necessary to mitigate these risks.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn whose mother is HIV-positive, the most appropriate diagnostic test to determine if the baby has been infected with HIV is the HIV DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or HIV RNA PCR (also known as viral load test). \n\nThe HIV DNA PCR test detects the genetic material of the virus itself and can identify the virus in the blood of infants as young as a few days old. This is the preferred test for diagnosing HIV in newborns because it can directly detect the presence of the virus.\n\nThe HIV antibody test, which is commonly used in adults, is not suitable for newborns because it detects antibodies against HIV, which are passed from the mother to the baby and can remain positive in the baby for up to 18 months, regardless of whether the baby is infected. Therefore, a positive antibody test in a newborn does not necessarily mean the baby is infected.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends HIV DNA PCR testing for all infants born to HIV-positive mothers at the following ages: \n- 14 to 21 days\n- 1 to 2 months\n- 4 to 6 months\n\nIf any of these tests are positive, they should be confirmed with a repeat test. If two or more separate blood samples test positive, the infant is considered to have HIV infection.\n\nIn summary, for addressing the patient's concern about the transmission of HIV to her baby, the HIV DNA PCR or RNA PCR test would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to be performed on the newborn as soon as possible after delivery, ideally within the first few weeks of life, as part of the recommended testing schedule.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "This is a complex and sensitive situation. The physician has a duty to maintain patient confidentiality, but they also have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of others, including the patient's wife. In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to:\n\n1. **Counsel the patient on the importance of disclosure**: The physician should explain to the patient the risks of not disclosing his HIV status to his wife, including the risk of transmission and the importance of her getting tested and seeking medical care if necessary.\n2. **Encourage the patient to disclose his status to his wife**: The physician should encourage the patient to disclose his HIV status to his wife, emphasizing the importance of honesty and transparency in their relationship, as well as the potential health consequences of not disclosing.\n3. **Offer to facilitate disclosure or provide resources**: If the patient is unwilling or unable to disclose his status to his wife, the physician can offer to facilitate disclosure or provide resources for counseling and support.\n4. **Follow local reporting laws and regulations**: The physician should be aware of local laws and regulations regarding the reporting of HIV cases. In many jurisdictions, healthcare providers are required to report HIV cases to public health authorities, who may then contact the patient's partners to inform them of their potential exposure.\n5. **Respect patient autonomy while protecting others**: If the patient still refuses to disclose his status to his wife, the physician should respect the patient's autonomy while also taking steps to protect the wife's health and well-being. This may involve notifying public health authorities, who can then take steps to inform the wife of her potential exposure without breaching patient confidentiality.\n\nIt's essential to note that the physician's primary responsibility is to the patient, but they also have a duty to protect the health and well-being of others. In this situation, the physician should strive to balance these competing interests while respecting patient autonomy and confidentiality.\n\n**American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines**:\n\nThe AMA guidelines state that physicians have a duty to protect the health and well-being of their patients, as well as the health and well-being of others who may be affected by their patients' actions. In cases where a patient has a serious infectious disease, such as HIV, the physician should:\n\n* Counsel the patient on the importance of disclosure\n* Encourage the patient to disclose their status to their partners\n* Offer to facilitate disclosure or provide resources for counseling and support\n* Follow local reporting laws and regulations\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines**:\n\nThe CDC guidelines recommend that healthcare providers:\n\n* Counsel patients with HIV on the importance of disclosure\n* Encourage patients to disclose their status to their partners\n* Provide resources for counseling and support\n* Follow local reporting laws and regulations\n\nUltimately, the physician should prioritize the health and well-being of all parties involved while respecting patient autonomy and confidentiality.",

When stained with India ink, light microscopy of the patient\u2019s CSF reveals encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds. Assuming a single pathogenic organism is responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms, what diagnostic test results would also be expected in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the presentation and lab findings, the patient is likely suffering from cryptococcal meningitis, caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The expected diagnostic test results in this patient would include:\n\n1. **Positive Cryptococcal Antigen (CrAg) test**: This is a rapid and sensitive test that detects the presence of cryptococcal capsular antigen in the CSF or serum. A positive result would confirm the diagnosis of cryptococcal infection.\n2. **Culture of CSF**: Fungal culture of the CSF would grow Cryptococcus neoformans, confirming the diagnosis.\n3. **CSF PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**: This molecular test can detect the genetic material of Cryptococcus neoformans in the CSF, providing a rapid and sensitive diagnosis.\n4. **Blood cultures**: Although not always positive, blood cultures may grow Cryptococcus neoformans, especially in patients with disseminated disease.\n5. **Imaging studies**: Depending on the severity of the disease, imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans of the head may show signs of increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, or cerebral cryptococcomas (focal lesions).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as headaches and nuchal rigidity, are consistent with meningitis, and the laboratory findings (increased CSF protein, decreased CSF glucose, and encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds on India ink stain) are characteristic of cryptococcal meningitis. The patient's HIV-positive status also increases the risk of opportunistic infections like cryptococcosis.",

    "question": " What would be the best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients?",
    "answer": "To study microRNAs (miRNAs) as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, a multi-disciplinary approach combining molecular biology, bioinformatics, and clinical research is necessary. Here's a suggested methodological approach:\n\n**Pre-clinical studies**\n\n1. **miRNA profiling**: Use high-throughput sequencing (e.g., next-generation sequencing, NGS) to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in HIV-infected cells or tissues compared to healthy controls.\n2. **In vitro experiments**: Use cell culture models (e.g., CD4+ T cells, macrophages) to investigate the effects of miRNAs on HIV replication, latency, and immune responses.\n3. **miRNA target identification**: Use bioinformatics tools (e.g., TargetScan, miRBase) to predict miRNA targets involved in HIV replication, immune modulation, or disease progression.\n4. **miRNA functional analysis**: Use techniques like RNA interference (RNAi), miRNA mimics, or antagomirs to modulate miRNA expression and assess their effects on HIV replication, immune responses, and cellular processes.\n\n**Clinical studies**\n\n1. **miRNA expression analysis**: Measure miRNA expression levels in HIV-infected patients' blood, tissue, or other bodily fluids (e.g., plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or NGS.\n2. **Correlative studies**: Investigate the relationship between miRNA expression levels and clinical parameters, such as viral load, CD4+ T cell count, and disease progression.\n3. **Longitudinal studies**: Monitor miRNA expression levels and clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients over time to identify potential biomarkers for disease progression or treatment response.\n4. **Interventional studies**: Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of miRNA-based therapeutic interventions, such as miRNA mimics or antagomirs, in HIV-infected patients.\n\n**Bioinformatics and systems biology approaches**\n\n1. **Network analysis**: Use tools like Cytoscape or NetworkAnalyzer to reconstruct miRNA-regulated networks involved in HIV replication, immune modulation, or disease progression.\n2. **Pathway analysis**: Apply tools like Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) or Reactome to identify biological pathways regulated by miRNAs in HIV infection.\n3. **Machine learning and predictive modeling**: Use techniques like support vector machines (SVMs) or random forests to identify miRNA signatures associated with disease progression or treatment response.\n\n**Considerations and challenges**\n\n1. **miRNA stability and specificity**: Ensure that miRNA measurements are reliable and specific to the target of interest.\n2. **Cell-type specificity**: Consider the cell-type specific expression of miRNAs and their targets.\n3. **HIV subtype and genetic variation**: Account for the genetic diversity of HIV and its impact on miRNA expression and function.\n4. **Sample size and statistical power**: Ensure sufficient sample sizes and statistical power to detect significant correlations or effects.\n5. **Off-target effects**: Minimize off-target effects of miRNA-based therapeutic interventions.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of miRNAs in HIV infection and develop effective miRNA-based therapeutic strategies to combat the disease.",
    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection have been extensively studied to understand the epigenetic mechanisms involved in HIV-1 latency and reactivation. Here's a summary of the current knowledge:\n\n**Latent HIV-1 infection:**\n\n1. **Hypermethylation of HIV-1 promoter**: In latently infected cells, the HIV-1 promoter region is often hypermethylated, which suppresses viral transcription and contributes to latency.\n2. **Methylation of specific CpG sites**: Certain CpG sites within the HIV-1 promoter and long terminal repeat (LTR) regions are hypermethylated in latent infection, including CpG sites within the NF-\u03baB and Sp1 binding sites.\n3. **Histone modifications**: Latent HIV-1 infection is also associated with repressive histone modifications, such as histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), which further contribute to transcriptional silencing.\n4. **DNA methylation patterns in cellular genes**: Latent HIV-1 infection can also alter DNA methylation patterns in cellular genes involved in immune response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, which may contribute to the maintenance of latency.\n\n**Active HIV-1 infection:**\n\n1. **Hypomethylation of HIV-1 promoter**: In actively infected cells, the HIV-1 promoter region is often hypomethylated, which allows for active viral transcription and replication.\n2. **Methylation of host genes**: Active HIV-1 infection can lead to changes in DNA methylation patterns in host genes involved in immune response, inflammation, and cell signaling, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1.\n3. **Epigenetic regulation of viral replication**: The expression of HIV-1 genes is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, which can influence viral replication and transcription.\n4. **Impact on host cell epigenome**: HIV-1 infection can also alter the epigenetic landscape of host cells, leading to changes in gene expression and cellular behavior, which may contribute to the development of HIV-1-associated diseases, such as cancer and neurocognitive disorders.\n\n**Comparison between latent and active infection:**\n\n1. **Distinct DNA methylation profiles**: Latent and active HIV-1 infections exhibit distinct DNA methylation profiles, with latent infection characterized by hypermethylation of the HIV-1 promoter and active infection characterized by hypomethylation.\n2. **Reversibility of epigenetic marks**: The epigenetic marks associated with latent HIV-1 infection can be reversed upon reactivation, allowing for the resumption of viral transcription and replication.\n3. **Epigenetic regulation of viral reservoirs**: The epigenetic mechanisms involved in HIV-1 latency and reactivation may contribute to the formation and maintenance of viral reservoirs, which are a major obstacle to HIV-1 cure.\n\nIn summary, DNA methylation profiles play a crucial role in regulating HIV-1 latency and reactivation, and understanding these epigenetic mechanisms can provide valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 treatment and cure.",
    "true_answer": "I searched for your question and found some relevant results. According to these results, **DNA methylation** is a possible mechanism that regulates the **latency** and **reactivation** of **HIV-1 provirus** in infected cells  . However, the **methylation profiles** of HIV-1 proviral DNA may vary depending on the **disease progression**, **antiretroviral therapy**, and **cell type** of the patients ."
