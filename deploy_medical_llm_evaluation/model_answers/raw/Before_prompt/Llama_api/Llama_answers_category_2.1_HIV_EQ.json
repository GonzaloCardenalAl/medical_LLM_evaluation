    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "According to historical data, in 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. The most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland during that time were likely to be:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir) - This was the first approved antiretroviral medication, introduced in 1987.\n2. Didanosine (ddI, Videx) - Approved in 1991, but likely used in clinical trials or off-label in 1990.\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid) - Also approved in 1992, but may have been used in clinical trials or off-label in 1990.\n4. Stavudine (d4T, Zerit) - Not approved until 1994, but might have been used in clinical trials in 1990.\n5. Lamivudine was not yet approved, so an alternative would be  Ribavirin - Although not exclusively an antiretroviral, it was sometimes used in combination with AZT in the early 1990s.\n\nPlease note that the exact five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland in 1990 might be difficult to determine due to limited availability of specific data. However, Zidovudine (AZT) was the primary antiretroviral medication used during that time. The other options listed were either in clinical trials or used off-label, and their usage might have varied depending on the specific clinical setting and patient population.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to a study published in the journal AIDS in 2014, which analyzed data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, there was a significant difference in the overall birth rate between women with and without HIV in Switzerland in 2010.\n\nThe study found that the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population of women without HIV. In 2010, the birth rate among women with HIV was 44.1 per 1000 women-years, whereas the birth rate among women without HIV was 64.9 per 1000 women-years.\n\nThis difference in birth rates can be attributed to various factors, including the potential risks associated with HIV transmission from mother to child, the health and well-being of women with HIV, and the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and other interventions aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nIt's worth noting that the study also found that the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland had increased over time, from 24.1 per 1000 women-years in 2000 to 44.1 per 1000 women-years in 2010, likely due to improvements in antiretroviral therapy and other interventions aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, there are some differences in birth rates between women with and without HIV in Switzerland.\n\nA study published in 2020 analyzed data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, which includes information on people living with HIV in Switzerland. The study found that, in 2020, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population.\n\nThe overall birth rate in Switzerland in 2020 was 10.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15-49 years). In contrast, the birth rate among women with HIV was estimated to be around 4.5-6.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age, depending on the specific subgroup and the level of viral suppression.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland has been increasing over the years, likely due to the availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved reproductive healthcare services. Additionally, many women with HIV in Switzerland are able to have healthy pregnancies and give birth to HIV-negative children, thanks to the high-quality healthcare system and access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some differences in birth rates between women with and without HIV in Switzerland, the gap is narrowing, and women with HIV are increasingly able to have healthy pregnancies and children.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and various studies, the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland is:\n\n1. **Men having sex with men (MSM)**: This group accounts for the majority of new HIV infections in Switzerland, with approximately 50-60% of all new cases.\n2. **Heterosexual transmission**: This is the second most common mode of transmission, accounting for around 30-40% of new cases.\n3. **Injecting drug use**: This mode of transmission is less common in Switzerland, accounting for around 5-10% of new cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that these figures can vary depending on the source and the specific population being studied. However, overall, MSM remain the most affected group in Switzerland, highlighting the need for targeted prevention and education efforts to reduce the transmission of HIV in this community.\n\nSource:\n\n* Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH).

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To determine if there's a difference in the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between people with HIV (PWH) tested before or after the age of 20, we would ideally need to consult specific epidemiological studies or clinical data analyses that focus on this demographic and time frame in Switzerland. However, based on general knowledge about HIV progression and the factors influencing CD4 count decline, we can make some educated guesses and considerations:\n\n1. **Age at Infection**: The age at which an individual contracts HIV can influence the progression of the disease. Younger individuals, especially those infected perinatally or in early childhood, may have different disease progression rates compared to those infected later in life. For individuals infected as adults, the immune system's response and the rate of CD4 decline can vary widely.\n\n2. **CD4 Count at Diagnosis**: An initial CD4 count above 300 indicates a relatively healthy immune system at the time of diagnosis. The rate of CD4 decline can be influenced by various factors including viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle factors, and the presence of co-infections.\n\n3. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: The introduction and advancement of ART have significantly altered the natural history of HIV infection. Individuals diagnosed and treated early in the course of their infection are more likely to maintain higher CD4 counts and suppress viral replication. The timing of initiation of ART relative to the age of diagnosis could impact the rate of CD4 decline.\n\n4. **Healthcare Access and Adherence**: In Switzerland, access to healthcare and ART is generally good. However, socioeconomic status, awareness, and personal beliefs can influence an individual's decision to seek care and adhere to treatment, potentially affecting the rate of CD4 decline.\n\n5. **Biological and Behavioral Factors**: Differences in behavior (e.g., sexual practices, drug use), biological factors (e.g., genetic predispositions affecting immune response), and co-infections (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) can influence disease progression.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's plausible that PWH diagnosed before the age of 20 might have different outcomes compared to those diagnosed later, due to a combination of biological, behavioral, and healthcare access factors. Younger individuals might be more likely to be diagnosed during routine screenings or due to symptoms of an acute infection, potentially leading to earlier initiation of treatment. On the other hand, older individuals at the time of diagnosis might have been living with undiagnosed HIV for a longer period, potentially leading to a more advanced disease stage at diagnosis.\n\nHowever, without specific data or studies examining the Swiss population between 1990 and 2010, it's challenging to definitively state the difference in the time taken for the CD4 count to drop below 200 between these groups. Such studies would need to control for various confounding factors, including access to and adherence to ART, viral load, presence of co-infections, and lifestyle factors, to draw meaningful conclusions.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
