    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the results of the lumbar puncture, it is likely that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The initiation of treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nGiven the patient's severely impaired immune system (CD4 count: 47) and the presence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) suggested by the elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (285 mm H2O), additional treatment to manage the increased ICP may be warranted.\n\nIn the acute setting, repeated lumbar punctures may be necessary to relieve elevated ICP and prevent further neurological deterioration. This procedure can help to decrease the pressure and alleviate symptoms such as headache and fatigue.\n\nAdditionally, the patient may benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, to reduce inflammation and swelling in the central nervous system, although this is not universally recommended and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIt's worth noting that Chloramphenicol is not typically used to treat cryptococcal meningitis. The patient you previously treated with Chloramphenicol likely had a different condition.\n\nIn summary, the additional treatments that may be warranted in this patient include:\n\n1. Repeated lumbar punctures to manage elevated ICP\n2. Adjunctive corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and swelling (considered on a case-by-case basis)\n\nClose monitoring of the patient's neurological status, ICP, and overall clinical condition is essential to guide further management.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV of a test is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negatives (people without the disease who test negative) divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives (people with the disease who test negative).\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS = 250\n- Patients with AIDS who tested positive = 240\n- Patients with AIDS who tested negative (false negatives) = 250 - 240 = 10\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n- Patients without AIDS who tested positive (false positives) = 5\n- Patients without AIDS who tested negative (true negatives) = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nPlugging the numbers into the formula: NPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\n\nCalculating the NPV: NPV = 245 / 255\n\nNPV = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nThis means that approximately 96.08% of the patients who test negative with this novel screening examination truly do not have AIDS. \n\nThe initial calculation mentioned (240 / (240 + 5)) actually refers to the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. This is not the NPV.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness of his right hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, particularly a central nervous system (CNS) infection, is high. The patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications increases his risk for opportunistic infections.\n\nThe neurological findings of 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation suggest a focal neurological deficit, which could be indicative of a localized CNS process such as a brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), among others. However, given the patient's fever and the fact that his hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years (suggesting a potential endemic area for certain fungal infections), an infection such as cryptococcal meningitis or another fungal infection should be considered.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to urgently perform diagnostic tests to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms. This should include:\n\n1. **Imaging Studies**: A CT or MRI of the brain to evaluate for any focal lesions, masses, or signs of increased intracranial pressure.\n2. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If the imaging does not show any contraindications (e.g., mass effect or increased intracranial pressure), a lumbar puncture should be performed to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for signs of infection (e.g., cryptococcal antigen, fungal culture, PCR for viruses like JC virus for PML, and bacterial or fungal cultures).\n3. **Blood Cultures**: To evaluate for any systemic infection.\n4. **CD4 Count and HIV Viral Load**: To assess the current status of his HIV infection and guide the management of his ART.\n5. **Toxoplasma Serology**: Given the possibility of toxoplasmosis, especially if the patient has a low CD4 count.\n\nGiven the hospital's empiric use of itraconazole, it might suggest a local prevalence of certain fungal infections. However, starting treatment should ideally be guided by diagnostic findings to ensure the appropriate antimicrobial coverage. Empiric treatment might be necessary in certain cases, but it should be tailored to the most likely diagnosis based on clinical presentation and epidemiological factors.\n\nIn this case, before starting any empiric antifungal treatment like itraconazole, it's crucial to consider the possibility of other opportunistic infections and to proceed with diagnostic testing to guide therapy. The patient's ART regimen should also be reviewed and optimized as part of his management to improve his immune status and reduce the risk of further opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) or possibly Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nThe key points that suggest this diagnosis are:\n\n1. **HIV infection with a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL)**: This indicates poorly controlled HIV infection, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and HIV-related neurological disorders.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient's symptoms, such as right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, and paranoid, agitated, and restless behavior, are consistent with a neurological disorder.\n3. **MRI findings**: The disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on the MRI are consistent with a demyelinating disease, such as PML, which is an opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus that can occur in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS.\n4. **Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive**: While this suggests past exposure to Toxoplasma, it is not necessarily the cause of the current symptoms, as the patient's Cryptococcal antigen is negative, and there is no mention of ring-enhancing lesions on the MRI, which are more typical of toxoplasmosis.\n\nVascular dementia is less likely, given the patient's age, the presence of HIV infection, and the specific neurological and imaging findings. Vascular dementia typically presents with a step-wise decline in cognitive function, often with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, which is not mentioned in this case.\n\n**Most likely diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, neurological symptoms, and MRI findings, PML is a strong consideration.\n2. **HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND)**: This is also a possible diagnosis, given the patient's HIV infection, cognitive symptoms, and neurological findings.\n\nFurther evaluation, including a lumbar puncture and JC virus PCR, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PML.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, the following tests should be performed:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: To determine the patient's blood type and Rh status, which can help identify potential complications during pregnancy.\n3. **Rubella Immunity**: To confirm immunity to rubella (German measles), which can cause congenital rubella syndrome if contracted during pregnancy.\n4. **Varicella Immunity**: To confirm immunity to varicella (chickenpox), which can cause congenital varicella syndrome if contracted during pregnancy.\n5. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)**: To screen for hepatitis B infection, which can be transmitted to the baby during birth.\n6. **HIV Testing**: To screen for HIV infection, which can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although she tested negative 4 years ago, it's recommended to retest during pregnancy.\n7. **Syphilis Testing**: To screen for syphilis, which can cause congenital syphilis if left untreated during pregnancy.\n8. **Urinalysis**: To check for protein, glucose, and ketones in the urine, which can indicate gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or other conditions.\n9. **Pap Smear**: To screen for cervical cancer, if it's been more than 3 years since her last Pap smear.\n10. **Serum TSH**: As mentioned, your hospital has been testing Serum TSH for the past 10 years, to screen for thyroid dysfunction, which can affect fetal development and maternal health.\n\nThe following tests are not universally recommended at this visit:\n\n* **CMV serology**: While your hospital has been testing for CMV serology, it's not a standard test recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for all pregnant women. CMV testing is typically only recommended for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, or a previous child with congenital CMV.\n* **PCR for HSV-2**: This test is not recommended as a routine screening test for all pregnant women. It's typically only recommended for women with a history of genital herpes or those who are suspected of having an active HSV-2 infection.\n\n**Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing**: These tests are typically recommended for pregnant women under 25 years old, or those with a new partner or multiple partners. Since this patient is 25 years old and has no history of recreational drug use or high-risk behavior, these tests may not be necessary at this visit. However, it's essential to assess her individual risk factors and consider retesting if she has a new partner or engages in high-risk behavior during pregnancy.\n\nKeep in mind that these recommendations are based on standard prenatal care guidelines and may vary depending on individual patient circumstances and hospital policies.",

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication often prescribed for patients with advanced HIV disease to prevent opportunistic infections, specifically cryptococcal disease and esophageal candidiasis.\n\nIn addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the patient should be considered for the following medications:\n\n1. **Fluconazole (as mentioned)**: For primary prophylaxis against cryptococcal disease, the patient should receive fluconazole 400 mg orally once daily if his CD4+ count is below 100 cells/mm3.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: For primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), TMP-SMX is the first-line choice. The typical dose is one double-strength tablet (160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole) orally once daily.\n3. **Azithromycin or clarithromycin**: For primary prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), azithromycin 1200 mg orally once weekly or clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily may be considered if the CD4+ count is below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's essential to note that these recommendations are based on guidelines and may need to be tailored to the individual patient's needs and medical history. The patient's depression should also be addressed, as it is a significant factor in his non-adherence to ART. Referral to a mental health professional and support services to help with medication adherence and management of his depression are crucial.\n\nBefore initiating any new medications, it's also important to consider potential drug-drug interactions, especially with the patient's ART regimen, and to monitor for any signs of adverse effects or toxicity.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient is likely suffering from Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a disease caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain in the skin lesion biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, it is essential to choose an effective treatment regimen. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is azithromycin or doxycycline. However, since the hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, it is likely that they are being used for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis, and the patient may be at risk for developing resistance to these medications.\n\nAzithromycin is a reasonable choice for the treatment of Bacillary Angiomatosis, and it can be used as an alternative to doxycycline. The recommended dose of azithromycin is 500 mg daily for at least 3 months.\n\nIn this case, considering the hospital's experience with Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, and the potential risk of resistance, azithromycin would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.\n\nIt's worth noting that erythromycin is also an effective treatment for BA, but azithromycin is generally preferred due to its better tissue penetration and longer half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's treatment regimen includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir for HIV, and considering one of the medications has pancreatitis as an adverse effect, we need to identify which medication is most likely associated with pancreatitis.\n\nAmong the medications listed:\n- **Lamivudine** is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and is not commonly associated with pancreatitis.\n- **Zidovudine** is also an NRTI. While NRTIs as a class can have various side effects, zidovudine is more commonly associated with bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headache rather than pancreatitis directly.\n- **Indinavir** is a protease inhibitor. Protease inhibitors can have several side effects, including gastrointestinal issues, but pancreatitis is not the most commonly highlighted risk specifically for indinavir compared to other side effects like nephrolithiasis.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that **didanosine (ddI)** and **stavudine (d4T)**, both NRTIs not mentioned in this patient's regimen, are more famously associated with pancreatitis among the antiretroviral drugs. But since the question hints at one of the prescribed medications having pancreatitis as an adverse effect and given the choices, we should consider the broader context of antiretroviral therapy side effects.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on the prescribed medications:\n- The patient is at risk for adverse effects related to the prescribed antiretroviral therapy. \n- **Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis** are potential adverse effects associated with NRTIs like lamivudine and zidovudine, though more commonly with stavudine and didanosine.\n- **Nephrolithiasis** is a known side effect of indinavir.\n\nSince pancreatitis was mentioned as an adverse effect of one of the treatments, and considering the provided medications, it seems there might be a bit of confusion in the question as none of lamivudine, zidovudine, or indinavir are primarily known for pancreatitis as a major risk. Didanosine, not listed, is more commonly associated with this risk.\n\nHowever, considering the broader context of side effects from these medications:\n- **Lamivudine and Zidovudine** can cause bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal symptoms, and lactic acidosis (less common with these two but more a class effect of NRTIs).\n- **Indinavir** can cause nephrolithiasis, gastrointestinal issues, and is associated with metabolic changes and lipodystrophy over time.\n\nGiven the confusion and focusing on the actual medications prescribed, the patient would be at risk for the known side effects of these drugs, which include but are not limited to:\n- **Bone marrow suppression** (especially with zidovudine)\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**\n- **Nephrolithiasis** (with indinavir)\n- **Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis** (a class effect of NRTIs, though less commonly emphasized with lamivudine and zidovudine)\n\nAnd, while not directly stated as a common side effect of these specific medications, vigilance for **metabolic changes and lipodystrophy** (associated with protease inhibitors like indinavir) is also necessary.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the current presentation of headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy, along with the laboratory and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why PCNSL is more likely than Glioblastoma in this context:\n\n1. **HIV Status and Immunosuppression**: The patient has a history of HIV with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL), indicating immunosuppression. PCNSL is more common in immunosuppressed individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS. The patient's history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy suggests periods of significant immunosuppression, increasing the risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies like PCNSL.\n\n2. **Neurological Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms, including headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, are consistent with a brain lesion. These symptoms can be seen in both PCNSL and Glioblastoma but are more likely to be associated with PCNSL in the context of HIV and immunosuppression.\n\n3. **Imaging Findings**: The MRI showing a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is highly suggestive of PCNSL, especially in an immunosuppressed patient. While Glioblastoma can also present with ring-enhancing lesions, the patient's immunocompromised state and the specific location involving the corpus callosum lean more towards PCNSL.\n\n4. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the CSF is a strong indicator of PCNSL. EBV is associated with a significant proportion of PCNSL cases in immunosuppressed patients, including those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n5. **Mini-Mental State Examination Score**: The score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment, which can be seen in both conditions but, combined with other factors, supports the diagnosis of PCNSL in this immunosuppressed patient.\n\nIn contrast, while Glioblastoma is a consideration for any patient presenting with a brain lesion and neurological symptoms, the specific combination of this patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, imaging findings, and CSF results pointing towards EBV infection makes PCNSL a more likely diagnosis. Glioblastoma would typically not be associated with EBV DNA in the CSF, and the clinical context provided strongly suggests an opportunistic malignancy related to the patient's immunosuppressed state.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. \n\nGiven the mother's HIV status and viral load, the infant is at risk for acquiring HIV. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis.\n\nThe recommended regimen typically includes:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, which is the most commonly used regimen. However, in cases where the mother's viral load is not well-controlled, as in this scenario (viral load of 678 copies/mL), a combination regimen may be considered.\n\n2. An alternative regimen that includes a combination of antiretroviral medications, such as zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, may be used, especially if the mother's viral load is not well-controlled, as in this case.\n\nIn addition to antiretroviral prophylaxis, the following steps should be taken:\n\n- HIV PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing should be performed on the infant at 14-21 days of life, 1-2 months of life, and 4-6 months of life to diagnose or rule out HIV infection.\n- The infant should not be breastfed, as HIV can be transmitted through breast milk.\n- The infant should receive standard vaccinations, but live vaccines (such as the MMR and varicella vaccines) should be avoided until the infant's HIV status is confirmed to be negative.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a pediatric HIV specialist to determine the best course of management for this infant, as the specific antiretroviral regimen and diagnostic testing schedule may vary depending on various factors, including the mother's viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and the infant's clinical status.",
