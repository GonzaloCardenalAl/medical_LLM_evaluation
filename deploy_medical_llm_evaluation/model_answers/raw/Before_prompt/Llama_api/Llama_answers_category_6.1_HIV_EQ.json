    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, it appears she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nThe mention of a previous patient with similar symptoms being treated with chloramphenicol is likely a red herring, as chloramphenicol is not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, the more critical additional treatment is the management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe patient's opening pressure of 285 mm H2O is significantly elevated, which can lead to complications such as brain herniation. To manage elevated ICP, the following measures may be taken:\n\n1. Frequent lumbar punctures to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduce pressure\n2. Administration of acetazolamide to decrease CSF production\n3. Head elevation to 30-40 degrees to reduce ICP\n4. Monitoring for signs of increased ICP, such as worsening headache, nausea, vomiting, or changes in mental status\n\nIt is essential to note that the management of elevated ICP should be done in consultation with a neurologist or an infectious disease specialist, as the patient's condition requires close monitoring and multidisciplinary care.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of the novel test, we first need to understand what NPV is. NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease. The formula for NPV is:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the data given:\n\n- True Positives (TP) = 240 (patients with AIDS who tested positive)\n- False Positives (FP) = 5 (patients without AIDS who tested positive)\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of False Negatives (FN) and True Negatives (TN).\n\n- False Negatives (FN) = Total patients with AIDS - True Positives = 250 - 240 = 10\n- True Negatives (TN) = Total patients without AIDS - False Positives = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nNPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel test is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of patients who test negative actually do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient presents with sudden weakness of his right hand, which has been gradually worsening. Given his past medical history of HIV with a low CD4 count (77/mm^3), the differential diagnosis should include opportunistic infections and neurological conditions more common in immunocompromised patients. The fever (temperature of 102.6\u00b0F or 39.2\u00b0C) also suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.\n\nThe neurological examination showing 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation indicates a focal neurological deficit. This, combined with the patient's immunocompromised state, raises concerns for conditions such as cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or even a CNS lymphoma. However, the focal nature of the deficit, particularly affecting one extremity, might also suggest a more localized process such as a stroke or an abscess, although the latter would typically have more pronounced focal neurological signs and possibly seizures.\n\nGiven the patient's history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), it's crucial to assess the current viral load and CD4 count to understand the degree of immunosuppression better. However, the immediate next step should focus on stabilizing the patient and further investigating the cause of the neurological deficit.\n\nThe use of empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years in the hospital suggests a protocol possibly aimed at treating fungal infections, which are common in immunocompromised patients. However, itraconazole would be more appropriately used after a diagnosis of a fungal infection is suspected or confirmed, based on clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient would involve:\n\n1. **Immediate Imaging**: A CT or MRI of the brain to evaluate for focal lesions, ischemia, or other abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms. This is crucial given the patient's history and presentation.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), blood cultures, HIV viral load, CD4 count, and other relevant tests to assess the patient's current immune status and to look for signs of infection or inflammation.\n\n3. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If imaging does not show a contraindication (such as a mass effect), an LP could be performed to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for signs of infection (e.g., cryptococcal antigen, toxoplasmosis PCR), inflammation, or malignancy.\n\n4. **Neurological Consultation**: Early consultation with a neurologist, preferably one with experience in HIV-related neurological conditions, to guide further diagnostic and therapeutic management.\n\n5. **Optimization of ART**: Ensuring the patient is on appropriate and effective ART, as improving the immune status can help in managing opportunistic infections and other HIV-related conditions.\n\n6. **Supportive Care**: Management of the patient's fever, blood pressure, and any other symptoms, along with close monitoring of his neurological status.\n\nEmpiric antifungal treatment like itraconazole might be considered if there's a strong suspicion of a fungal infection based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings. However, this should be done under the guidance of an infectious disease specialist and based on a thorough diagnostic workup.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided clinical presentation and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) or more specifically, given the imaging findings and the clinical context, HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD), also known as AIDS Dementia Complex.\n\nThe key points that lead to this diagnosis include:\n1. **HIV Infection with Low CD4+ Count and High Viral Load**: The patient has a very low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and a high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL), indicating poorly controlled HIV infection. This suggests that the patient's immune system is severely compromised, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections and direct effects of HIV on the brain.\n\n2. **Neurological and Cognitive Symptoms**: The patient presents with a decline in cognitive function (forgetfulness, difficulty operating appliances, getting lost), motor symptoms (right leg weakness, unsteady gait), and psychiatric symptoms (paranoia, agitation, restlessness). These are consistent with HIV-Associated Dementia, which can present with a combination of cognitive, motor, and behavioral abnormalities.\n\n3. **MRI Findings**: The MRI shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect. This pattern is consistent with the changes seen in HIV-Associated Dementia, where white matter abnormalities are common.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Causes**: While the patient has risk factors for vascular dementia (hypertension, diabetes), the clinical presentation and imaging findings are not typical for vascular dementia. The absence of focal neurological deficits (other than the right lower extremity weakness) and the presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI also argue against a diagnosis of stroke or vascular dementia. The negative serum Cryptococcal antigen and the clinical presentation do not strongly suggest cryptococcal meningitis, and Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity indicates past exposure rather than active infection.\n\n5. **Somnolence and Confusion**: The patient's somnolence and confusion could be attributed to the direct effects of HIV on the brain or to other opportunistic infections or conditions related to his immunocompromised state.\n\nIn conclusion, given the combination of cognitive decline, motor symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, low CD4+ count, high HIV viral load, and characteristic MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD) rather than vascular dementia. Management would involve antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control the HIV infection, as well as symptomatic treatment for the cognitive, motor, and psychiatric symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Based on the information provided and standard prenatal care guidelines, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and other blood-related conditions.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor:** Determining the blood type and Rh factor is crucial to identify any potential need for Rh immunoglobulin during pregnancy.\n3. **Rubella Immunity:** Confirming immunity to rubella (German measles) is important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome.\n4. **Varicella Immunity:** Checking for immunity to varicella (chickenpox) to assess the risk of varicella infection during pregnancy.\n5. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):** Screening for hepatitis B infection to manage and prevent maternal-fetal transmission.\n6. **HIV Testing:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant women at the initial prenatal visit, regardless of previous test results, due to the potential for new exposure.\n7. **Syphilis Screening:** Testing for syphilis is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n8. **Urinalysis:** To check for urinary tract infections (UTIs), proteinuria, and glucosuria.\n9. **Pap Smear (if due):** If the patient's last Pap smear was not within the recommended screening interval, it may be performed at this visit.\n10. **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** As mentioned, your hospital has been testing Serum TSH as part of routine prenatal care to screen for thyroid dysfunction.\n11. **CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Serology:** Since your hospital has been performing CMV serology, it would be included in the initial screening to assess the risk of congenital CMV infection.\n12. **PCR for HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2):** Given the hospital's protocol, testing for HSV-2 via PCR might be considered, especially if there's a history suggestive of herpes infection or if the patient is at high risk. However, routine screening for HSV-2 in asymptomatic pregnant women is not universally recommended.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening:** Although she tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea for all pregnant women under 25 years of age at the first prenatal visit.\n- **Ultrasonography:** An early ultrasound, around 7-10 weeks of gestation, can confirm the gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and identify potential early complications.\n\nEach patient's specific situation and risk factors should guide the selection of tests. The healthcare provider should discuss the rationale and potential benefits and risks of each test with the patient to make informed decisions about her care.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is commonly prescribed for patients with low CD4+ counts to prevent fungal infections, particularly oral and esophageal candidiasis.\n\nIn addition to restarting his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should be considered for the following medications:\n\n1. **Fluconazole**: As you mentioned, this is often prescribed to prevent oral and esophageal candidiasis, which is common in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: This is a first-line medication for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n3. **Azithromycin**: This may be considered for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is another opportunistic infection that can occur in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nThe patient's depression should also be addressed, as it can significantly impact his adherence to treatment and overall quality of life. Referral to a mental health professional and consideration of antidepressant medication may be necessary.\n\nIt's essential to note that the specific medications and dosages will depend on the patient's individual needs, medical history, and potential drug interactions. A healthcare provider should be consulted to determine the best course of treatment for this patient.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of this condition.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (98/mm3) and HIV status, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is Azithromycin or Erythromycin. However, the hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, which is not the first-line treatment for BA.\n\nThe recommended treatment for BA is:\n\n1. Azithromycin (500-1000 mg/day) for at least 3 months\n2. Alternatively, Erythromycin (500-1000 mg/day) for at least 3 months\n\nPyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are typically used to treat Toxoplasmosis, which is a different condition. While sulfadiazine has some activity against Bartonella species, it is not the preferred treatment for BA.\n\nIn this case, it would be best to consult with an infectious disease specialist and consider switching to Azithromycin or Erythromycin as the primary treatment for Bacillary Angiomatosis.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2.

An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Based on the treatment regimen prescribed, which includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Pancreatitis**: As you mentioned, one of the medications (likely didanosine or stavudine, but in this case, it's not explicitly stated which one) has pancreatitis as an adverse effect. However, among the medications listed (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), none are commonly associated with pancreatitis. But, if we consider didanosine or stavudine (not listed), which are known to cause pancreatitis, then it's a risk.\n2. **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis**: These are potential adverse effects associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like lamivudine and zidovudine.\n3. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis due to its low solubility in urine.\n4. **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can also cause hyperbilirubinemia, which may lead to jaundice.\n5. **Lipodystrophy syndrome**: This is a potential long-term adverse effect associated with antiretroviral therapy, particularly with the use of protease inhibitors like indinavir, and NRTIs like zidovudine.\n\nHowever, considering the recent prescription and the mention of pancreatitis as an adverse effect, the patient is likely at greatest risk for:\n\n* **Pancreatitis** (if the medication in question is indeed associated with this side effect)\n* **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis** (associated with NRTIs like lamivudine and zidovudine)\n* **Mitochondrial toxicity** (associated with NRTIs like zidovudine)\n\nKeep in mind that the actual medication causing pancreatitis is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, it's essential to review the patient's medication regimen and medical history to accurately assess the risk of adverse effects.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV status and immunosuppression**: The patient has a history of HIV and has been inconsistently taking his antiretroviral medications, leading to a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL). This immunosuppression increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, which are consistent with a brain lesion.\n3. **Imaging findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, which is a common location for PCNSL. The size of the lesion (4.5 cm) is also consistent with PCNSL.\n4. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is a known risk factor for PCNSL, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals.\n5. **Distinguishing from Glioblastoma**: While the patient's symptoms and imaging findings could be consistent with Glioblastoma, the presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid and the patient's immunosuppressed status make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis. Additionally, PCNSL is more commonly associated with immunosuppression, whereas Glioblastoma can occur in immunocompetent individuals.\n\nIt's worth noting that PCNSL is a rare and aggressive malignancy that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient's recent adherence to antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may have contributed to the slight improvement in his condition, but further evaluation and treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, and/or steroids may be necessary to manage his PCNSL.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. \n\nGiven the mother's HIV status and viral load, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following:\n\n1. **Administer zidovudine (AZT) to the newborn**: The standard regimen is 2 mg/kg/dose orally every 6 hours for 4-6 weeks. This is the first-line choice for preventing MTCT of HIV in newborns.\n\nThe use of lamivudine and nevirapine, as mentioned, might be considered in certain cases, but for this newborn, zidovudine monotherapy is the initial recommended approach.\n\nAdditionally, the following steps should be taken:\n\n- **HIV testing**: The newborn should undergo HIV testing, including virologic tests (e.g., HIV DNA or RNA PCR) at birth (or as soon as possible), at 14-21 days, at 1-2 months, and at 4-6 months of age. \n- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular follow-up with a pediatrician experienced in HIV care to monitor for signs of HIV infection and to adjust the antiretroviral prophylaxis as needed based on the infant's HIV test results.\n- **Support and counseling for the mother**: Ensuring the mother is receiving appropriate care and support for her HIV infection and providing counseling on safe feeding practices (e.g., formula feeding in settings where it is safe and feasible, as HIV can be transmitted through breast milk).\n\nIt's crucial to note that guidelines and recommendations can evolve, and the management should be tailored to the specific clinical scenario and in accordance with the most current guidelines from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the AAP.",
