    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is appropriate for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, the more critical additional treatment is the management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe patient's opening pressure of 285 mm H2O is significantly elevated, which can lead to complications such as brain herniation and death. To manage elevated ICP, the following treatments may be considered:\n\n1. Frequent lumbar punctures to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduce ICP.\n2. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to decrease CSF production.\n3. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, to reduce ICP.\n4. Ventriculostomy or other neurosurgical interventions, if necessary, to manage refractory elevated ICP.\n\nIt is essential to closely monitor the patient's neurological status, ICP, and overall condition, and to involve a neurologist and/or an infectious disease specialist in her care.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we first need to understand what NPV is. The NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who are truly free of the disease. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\n- True Negatives (TN) are the number of patients without AIDS who test negative. Since 5 out of 250 patients without AIDS tested positive, the number of patients without AIDS who tested negative is 250 - 5 = 245.\n- False Negatives (FN) are the number of patients with AIDS who test negative. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, the number of patients with AIDS who tested negative is 250 - 240 = 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nNPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 96.08%. This means that about 96.08% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection or a stroke is high. The patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and his immunocompromised state increase his risk for various opportunistic infections, including those that can affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). However, the acute onset of focal neurological deficits (weakness in one hand) also raises concern for a cerebrovascular event (stroke), which could be ischemic or hemorrhagic.\n\nThe next best step in management would involve several concurrent actions:\n\n1. **Immediate Neuroimaging**: A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head should be performed promptly to differentiate between ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and other causes such as space-occupying lesions (e.g., toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma). If the CT scan does not show a hemorrhage, further evaluation with MRI (including diffusion-weighted imaging) could be considered to better assess for ischemic changes or other pathologies.\n\n2. **Laboratory Evaluation**: \n   - Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for signs of infection or inflammation.\n   - Electrolyte panel to evaluate for any imbalances that could contribute to weakness.\n   - Liver function tests (LFTs) and renal function tests to assess the impact of medications and potential organ dysfunction.\n   - Blood cultures to evaluate for bacteremia, especially given the fever.\n   - HIV viral load and CD4 count to assess the current status of HIV infection and the effectiveness of the current ART regimen.\n   - Coagulation studies if there's suspicion of a bleeding disorder or if anticoagulation is considered.\n\n3. **Infectious Disease Consultation**: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, consultation with an infectious disease specialist can help guide the evaluation and treatment of potential opportunistic infections, including consideration of empirical treatment for conditions like toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis based on clinical suspicion and diagnostic findings.\n\n4. **Neurology Consultation**: A neurologist can provide valuable insight into the acute management of stroke or other neurological conditions, including the potential use of thrombolytic therapy if an ischemic stroke is diagnosed within a appropriate time window, and guidance on further diagnostic testing (e.g., lumbar puncture).\n\n5. **Admission and Monitoring**: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring of his neurological status, fever, and other vital signs. This will also allow for timely initiation of any necessary treatments based on diagnostic findings.\n\n6. **Optimization of HIV Management**: The patient's ART regimen should be reviewed, and adherence should be strongly encouraged. Consideration should be given to adjusting the regimen if the current viral load is not well controlled.\n\nGiven the complexity of this patient's presentation and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to his care, immediate consultation with neurology, infectious disease, and potentially other specialties (depending on findings) is crucial for optimal management.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nPML is a rare and serious demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The disease is caused by the reactivation of the JC virus, a common virus that is usually harmless in healthy individuals.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as progressive weakness, unsteady gait, forgetfulness, and cognitive decline, are consistent with PML. The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI is also characteristic of PML. The lack of mass effect and the absence of enhancement with contrast are typical features of PML.\n\nThe patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) indicate advanced HIV disease and a compromised immune system, which increases the risk of developing PML.\n\nOther possible diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis, are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen test and the absence of focal neurological deficits or mass effect on MRI. Toxoplasmosis is also less likely given the presence of nonenhancing lesions, as toxoplasmosis typically causes enhancing lesions.\n\nOverall, the combination of the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings makes PML the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Given the patient's presentation and history, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. **Confirmation of Pregnancy**: Although the patient is already aware of her pregnancy, a urine or serum pregnancy test can confirm the pregnancy if it hasn't been done recently.\n\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: Determining the patient's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh factor (positive or negative) is crucial. If the patient is Rh-negative, she may need additional testing and potentially Rh immune globulin during pregnancy to prevent sensitization.\n\n3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: This test assesses for anemia, which is common in pregnancy due to increased blood volume, and detects any other abnormalities in blood cell counts.\n\n4. **Blood Screening for Infections**:\n   - **HIV**: Even though she tested negative 4 years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HIV screening for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, regardless of previous test results.\n   - **Syphilis**: Screening for syphilis is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n   - **Hepatitis B**: Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n\n5. **Urinalysis**: To check for protein, glucose, and signs of infection in the urine.\n\n6. **Pap Smear (if due)**: If the patient is due for a routine cervical cancer screening according to guidelines (generally every 3 years for women aged 21-65), a Pap smear may be performed at this visit.\n\n7. **Ultrasound**: An ultrasound at 7-10 weeks can confirm the gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and identify potential complications early on.\n\n8. **Screening for Gestational Diabetes and Other Conditions**: While not typically done at the first visit, discussing risk factors for gestational diabetes and planning for the glucose screening test around 24-28 weeks of gestation is part of prenatal care.\n\n9. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening**: This is typically done between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation, but discussing the risks and planning for this screening is part of comprehensive prenatal care.\n\nGiven the patient's negative history for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago, and assuming she has had no new exposures or risk factors since then, routine screening for these infections might not be immediately necessary unless there are specific risk factors or symptoms. However, guidelines often recommend screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea for all pregnant women under 25 years old at the first prenatal visit, regardless of previous test results. \n\nIt's also important to note that while this patient's BMI is within the normal range, discussing nutrition, weight gain expectations, and other lifestyle factors is an essential part of prenatal care.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of non-adherence to his HIV medications due to depression, and considering his current low CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm^3, it's crucial to address both the HIV management and the mental health aspect. For the HIV management, the focus will be on re-initiating or optimizing his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to improve his CD4+ count and suppress the viral load. However, the question specifically asks for medication(s) in addition to ART.\n\nTo address the patient's depression, which is a significant concern given its impact on his adherence to HIV treatment, antidepressant medication(s) should be considered. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used as first-line treatment for depression in the general population and can be used in HIV-positive patients as well. However, the choice of SSRI should be made with consideration of potential drug-drug interactions with the patient's ART regimen.\n\nSome SSRIs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which can be affected by certain antiretroviral drugs, particularly protease inhibitors and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). For example:\n\n- **Efavirenz**, an NNRTI, can induce CYP3A4, potentially reducing the levels of certain SSRIs.\n- **Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors** can inhibit CYP3A4, potentially increasing the levels of certain SSRIs.\n\nGiven these considerations, an SSRI with a lower risk of drug-drug interactions would be preferable. **Escitalopram** and **sertraline** are often considered good options because they have fewer interactions with antiretroviral medications compared to other SSRIs.\n\nIn addition to treating depression, the patient should be evaluated for other potential issues such as anxiety, substance use, or social determinants of health that might be affecting his adherence. A multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatric care, social work support, and adherence counseling, is crucial for managing his overall health.\n\nIt's also important to consider prophylactic medications to prevent opportunistic infections given his low CD4+ count. For a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm^3, prophylaxis against **Pneumocystis jirovecii** pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, and possibly other opportunistic infections should be considered, according to current guidelines. **Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)** is commonly used for PCP prophylaxis and can also provide protection against toxoplasmosis.\n\nIn summary, in addition to optimizing his anti-retroviral therapy, the patient should be considered for:\n\n1. **Antidepressant medication**, such as escitalopram or sertraline, to manage his depression.\n2. **Prophylactic medications** for opportunistic infections, such as TMP/SMX for PCP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis, based on his current CD4+ count and according to current guidelines.\n\nA thorough evaluation and management plan should be developed in consultation with an HIV specialist and, if necessary, a psychiatrist, to address both his HIV care and mental health needs.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. This condition is more common in individuals with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is antibiotics that target Bartonella species. The recommended treatment is:\n\n1. Erythromycin: 500 mg orally four times a day for at least 3 months.\n2. Doxycycline: 100 mg orally twice a day for at least 3 months.\n\nAlternative treatments include:\n\n1. Azithromycin: 500 mg orally once a day for at least 3 months.\n2. Clarithromycin: 500 mg orally twice a day for at least 3 months.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's HIV status and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count also require attention. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized to improve the patient's immune function and prevent further opportunistic infections.\n\nIn addition to treating the BA, it's crucial to address the patient's substance use disorder, malnutrition, and other comorbidities to improve overall health outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach, including infectious disease specialists, HIV care providers, and social workers, can help manage the patient's complex needs.",

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Based on the treatment regimen started, which includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis**: This is a rare but serious side effect associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like lamivudine and zidovudine. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue.\n\n2. **Bone marrow suppression**: Zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n3. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can increase the risk of kidney stones due to its low solubility in urine.\n\n4. **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can also cause hyperbilirubinemia (elevated bilirubin levels), which may lead to jaundice.\n\n5. **Lipodystrophy syndrome**: This is a long-term side effect associated with antiretroviral therapy, particularly with protease inhibitors like indinavir, and NRTIs. It includes symptoms like fat redistribution (e.g., buffalo hump, central obesity), dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal side effects**: All three medications can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, although these are often more common with the initiation of therapy and may diminish over time.\n\nIt's essential for the patient to be closely monitored for these potential adverse effects and to maintain open communication with his healthcare provider regarding any symptoms or concerns that arise during treatment.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **HIV diagnosis and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy adherence**: The patient's history of HIV and inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, are consistent with a brain lesion.\n3. **Mini-Mental State Examination score**: A score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment, which is consistent with a brain lesion affecting cognitive function.\n4. **MRI findings**: The solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is a characteristic feature of PCNSL. The lesion's location and appearance are consistent with a lymphoma.\n5. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis (increased cell count) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is a known risk factor for PCNSL, particularly in immunocompromised individuals like those with HIV.\n6. **Low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count**: The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 90/\u03bcL indicates significant immunosuppression, which increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n\nWhile other diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, could be considered, the combination of the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings makes PCNSL the most likely diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.\n\nGiven that the mother has a viral load of 678 copies/mL, which is above the threshold of 1000 copies/mL where the risk of MTCT significantly increases, but still indicates that the mother is on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), the baby is at risk of acquiring HIV. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all infants born to HIV-positive mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce this risk.\n\nThe recommended regimen typically involves the administration of zidovudine (AZT) to the newborn, starting as soon as possible after birth, ideally within the first 6-12 hours of life, and continuing for 4-6 weeks. This regimen may be adjusted based on the specifics of the case, including the mother's viral load, the mode of delivery, and whether any other interventions were used to reduce MTCT.\n\nAdditionally, the infant should undergo HIV testing, including a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for HIV DNA or RNA, at birth (or as soon as possible), at 14-21 days, at 1-2 months, and at 4-6 months of age. This testing is crucial for early diagnosis of HIV infection in the infant.\n\nOther considerations include:\n\n- Providing supportive care and monitoring the infant's health closely.\n- Counseling the mother on safe feeding practices, as HIV can be transmitted through breast milk. In settings where safe alternatives are readily available and culturally acceptable, HIV-positive mothers are advised against breastfeeding their infants.\n- Ensuring the mother continues her antiretroviral therapy and receives appropriate medical care.\n\nIt's also important to note that the management of the infant should be done in consultation with a pediatrician experienced in the care of HIV-exposed infants, and as part of a comprehensive program that includes both pediatric and adult HIV care services.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
