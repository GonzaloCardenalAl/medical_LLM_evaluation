    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is appropriate for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment that may be warranted in this patient is:\n\n1. **Corticosteroids**: The patient has increased intracranial pressure (ICP) as evidenced by the elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (285 mm H2O). Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, may be used to reduce inflammation and swelling, thereby decreasing ICP and alleviating symptoms.\n2. **Repeat lumbar punctures**: To manage increased ICP, repeat lumbar punctures may be necessary to remove excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduce pressure.\n3. **Anticonvulsant prophylaxis**: Cryptococcal meningitis can increase the risk of seizures, so anticonvulsant prophylaxis may be considered to prevent seizures.\n4. **Supportive care**: The patient should receive supportive care, including pain management, antipyretics, and hydration, to manage her symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's CD4 count is very low (47), indicating advanced immunosuppression. Therefore, it is crucial to consider other opportunistic infections and to provide comprehensive care to manage her underlying HIV infection and prevent further complications.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we need to understand what NPV represents. NPV is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease. Mathematically, it can be calculated as:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\n- True Negatives (TN) are the patients without AIDS who test negative. Since 5 out of 250 patients without AIDS tested positive, 250 - 5 = 245 patients without AIDS tested negative.\n- False Negatives (FN) are the patients with AIDS who test negative. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 250 - 240 = 10 patients with AIDS tested negative.\n\nSo, the NPV calculation is:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\nNPV \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of the patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient presents with sudden weakness of his right hand, which has been gradually worsening, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, indicating a compromised immune system. Given his symptoms and medical history, the differential diagnosis includes:\n\n1. **Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** Although less common in younger individuals, his family history of cardiovascular disease and his own history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase his risk. However, his age and the gradual onset of symptoms are somewhat atypical for a traditional stroke.\n2. **Infectious or Inflammatory Causes:** Given his immunocompromised state, infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, or abscesses could present with focal neurological deficits. However, the absence of headache, fever (until now), or altered mental status makes these less likely.\n3. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** A rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus that affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It can cause focal neurological deficits but typically does not present with acute weakness.\n4. **Toxoplasmosis:** An opportunistic infection that can cause focal brain lesions in immunocompromised patients, leading to neurological symptoms.\n\nGiven the acute presentation and the presence of fever, the immediate concern would be to rule out an infectious or inflammatory cause, as well as a stroke. The next best steps in management would include:\n\n1. **Imaging Studies:** An urgent MRI of the brain with and without contrast is crucial to evaluate for stroke, infections, or other focal lesions such as toxoplasmosis or PML. If MRI is not available, a CT scan of the head could be an alternative, though it is less sensitive for some of these conditions.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests:** Complete blood counts, blood cultures, and HIV viral load should be checked. Given his immunocompromised state, checking for other opportunistic infections might also be necessary.\n\n3. **Neurological Consultation:** Consulting with a neurologist can help in interpreting the neurological exam and guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\n4. **Start Empiric Treatment:** Depending on the suspected cause, empiric treatment might be initiated. For example, if toxoplasmosis is suspected, empiric treatment with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine could be started. If a stroke is suspected, urgent evaluation by a stroke team for potential thrombolytic therapy or other interventions would be necessary.\n\n5. **Address Fever and Potential Infection:** Given the patient's fever, broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or antiviral medications might be considered pending culture results and further diagnostic clarification.\n\n6. **Adherence to HIV Medication:** It's crucial to address the patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy, as improving his immune status can help prevent opportunistic infections and other complications.\n\nThe patient's presentation with fever and focal neurological deficits in the context of immunocompromise requires a broad and urgent diagnostic approach to identify and treat potentially life-threatening conditions.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nPML is a rare and often fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the JC virus, which is a type of polyomavirus. It primarily affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS, as in this case.\n\nThe key features that point towards PML in this patient include:\n\n1. **Immunocompromised state**: The patient has advanced HIV/AIDS, as indicated by a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL).\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: The patient presents with progressive right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, and cognitive decline (forgetfulness, difficulty with familiar routes, and operating appliances), which are consistent with a CNS demyelinating disease.\n3. **MRI findings**: The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI is characteristic of PML. These lesions typically do not enhance with contrast, which helps to differentiate PML from other CNS infections or tumors.\n4. **Absence of mass effect**: The lack of mass effect on the MRI also supports the diagnosis of PML, as the disease typically causes demyelination without significant inflammation or edema.\n5. **Negative cryptococcal antigen and toxoplasmosis IgG positive**: While the patient has a positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG, indicating past exposure, the negative cryptococcal antigen makes cryptococcal meningitis less likely. Toxoplasmosis can cause CNS lesions, but they are typically enhancing and associated with a different clinical presentation.\n\nOther diagnoses, such as CNS lymphoma or toxoplasmosis, could be considered, but the combination of the patient's immunocompromised state, clinical presentation, and characteristic MRI findings make PML the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby. Given the information provided, the following tests should be considered for this patient:\n\n1. **Confirmation of Pregnancy**: Although the patient is already aware of her pregnancy, a urine pregnancy test or a quantitative beta-hCG test can confirm the pregnancy and help estimate gestational age if the last menstrual period (LMP) is uncertain.\n\n2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia and other blood abnormalities.\n\n3. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: Determining the patient's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh factor (positive or negative) is crucial. If the patient is Rh-negative, she may require RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) later in pregnancy to prevent sensitization.\n\n4. **Rubella Immunity**: Confirming immunity to rubella (German measles) is important to prevent infection during pregnancy, which can have serious consequences for the fetus.\n\n5. **Varicella Immunity**: Checking for immunity to varicella (chickenpox) is also recommended. If the patient is not immune, she should be counseled on avoiding exposure and potentially vaccinated postpartum.\n\n6. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)**: Screening for hepatitis B infection is standard to identify mothers who can transmit the virus to their newborns. If positive, the baby will receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth.\n\n7. **Syphilis Screening**: A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test to screen for syphilis, which can have severe consequences for the fetus if left untreated.\n\n8. **HIV Screening**: Although the patient tested negative 4 years ago, the CDC recommends HIV screening for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). This is because the risk factors for HIV can change over time.\n\n9. **Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening**: The CDC recommends screening all pregnant women under the age of 25 for Chlamydia and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit, as well as those over 25 with risk factors. Since this patient is under 25 and was last tested 4 years ago, she should be screened again.\n\n10. **Urine Culture**: To check for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and potentially pyelonephritis, a serious condition that requires prompt treatment.\n\n11. **Pap Smear**: If the patient is due for a routine cervical cancer screening according to current guidelines (generally every 3 years for women aged 21-65), a Pap smear may be performed at this visit. However, it's not necessarily a standard test at the first prenatal visit unless it's due based on her screening history.\n\n12. **Ultrasound**: An early ultrasound can confirm gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and check for embryonic cardiac activity. It's typically performed between 7-10 weeks of gestation.\n\n13. **First Trimester Screening for Aneuploidy**: This includes non-invasive tests such as the combined test (which combines ultrasound markers with blood tests) or cell-free DNA screening, which can be offered to all pregnant women, regardless of age, to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome.\n\nEach of these tests and screenings serves a unique purpose in ensuring a healthy pregnancy and identifying any potential issues early on. The specific tests performed may vary based on the patient's individual risk factors, medical history, and preferences, as well as the recommendations of her healthcare provider.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to depression and his current low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), it is crucial to address both his mental health and the risk of opportunistic infections associated with a severely compromised immune system. \n\n1. **Antidepressant Medication**: To manage his depression, the patient should be started on an antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used and generally safe in patients with HIV. Examples include fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine. However, it's essential to choose an SSRI that has minimal interactions with his antiretroviral medications, as some antiretrovirals are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which can be affected by certain SSRIs.\n\n2. **Prophylaxis against Opportunistic Infections**: With a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3, patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Specifically, for a CD4+ count as low as 33 cells/mm3, prophylaxis against the following opportunistic infections should be considered:\n   - **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the first-line choice for PCP prophylaxis.\n   - **Toxoplasmosis**: TMP-SMX also provides protection against toxoplasmosis, so separate prophylaxis may not be needed if the patient is already on TMP-SMX.\n   - **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)**: Azithromycin is recommended for MAC prophylaxis in patients with a CD4+ count below 50 cells/mm3.\n   - **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** and other opportunistic infections may require specific prophylaxis based on individual risk factors and geography.\n\n3. **Reinitiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: The patient should be restarted on ART as soon as possible, with careful selection of medications to ensure susceptibility of the patient's HIV strain, given the history of non-adherence which may have led to drug resistance. Genotypic resistance testing can guide the choice of antiretroviral medications.\n\nIt's also important to address the reasons for non-adherence, provide counseling, and consider directly observed therapy (DOT) or other adherence support strategies to help the patient maintain adherence to his treatment regimen. Additionally, the patient should be screened for other mental health issues, substance abuse, and social determinants of health that may impact his ability to adhere to treatment.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain in the skin biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is azithromycin. The recommended treatment is:\n\n* Azithromycin 500 mg orally daily for at least 3 months\n\nAlternative treatments include:\n\n* Erythromycin 500 mg orally four times a day for at least 3 months\n* Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for at least 3 months\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (98/mm3) indicate a compromised immune system, which increases her risk for opportunistic infections like bacillary angiomatosis. Therefore, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized to improve her immune function and prevent further opportunistic infections.\n\nIn addition to treating the bacillary angiomatosis, the patient's other health issues, such as her substance use disorder and malnutrition (BMI 19 kg/m2), should also be addressed.",

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects due to the treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis**: This is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like lamivudine and zidovudine. Patients should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\n2. **Bone marrow suppression**: Zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Regular blood counts should be performed to monitor for these effects.\n\n3. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis due to its low solubility in urine. Patients should be advised to drink plenty of water to reduce this risk.\n\n4. **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can also cause an increase in bilirubin levels, which may lead to jaundice.\n\n5. **Lipodystrophy**: The combination of antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors like indinavir, can lead to lipodystrophy, characterized by abnormal fat distribution, including lipoatrophy (loss of fat) and lipohypertrophy (accumulation of fat).\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: All three medications can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n7. **Peripheral neuropathy**: Some antiretroviral medications, including certain NRTIs, can cause peripheral neuropathy, although this is less common with lamivudine and zidovudine compared to other NRTIs like didanosine and stavudine.\n\nRegular monitoring and follow-up appointments with the healthcare provider are essential to manage these potential side effects and adjust the treatment regimen as necessary to minimize adverse effects while effectively managing HIV.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, which are common symptoms of PCNSL.\n2. **HIV status**: The patient has a history of HIV infection, and PCNSL is a known complication of immunosuppression, particularly in patients with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n3. **Imaging**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, which is a characteristic feature of PCNSL.\n4. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL, as EBV is associated with a significant proportion of PCNSL cases in immunocompromised patients.\n5. **Low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count**: The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL, which indicates significant immunosuppression and increases the risk of developing PCNSL.\n\nWhile other diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, are possible in an HIV-positive patient with a ring-enhancing lesion, the combination of symptoms, imaging findings, and cerebrospinal fluid results makes PCNSL the most likely diagnosis.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's recent inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy may have contributed to the development of PCNSL, as it can lead to a decline in immune function and increase the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant, born to an HIV-positive mother, is to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. The specific regimen and duration may vary based on guidelines and the mother's viral load at the time of delivery, but the general approach includes:\n\n1. **Administering Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to the Newborn:**\n   - For newborns born to mothers with a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, or in cases where the viral load is not well controlled, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other guidelines often recommend a combination of antiretroviral drugs for the infant. Typically, this includes zidovudine (AZT) for 4-6 weeks, with or without additional medications like nevirapine or lamivudine, depending on the specific circumstances and the most current guidelines.\n\n2. **HIV Testing for the Infant:**\n   - Arrange for HIV testing of the infant. The initial test is usually a virologic test (such as HIV DNA or RNA PCR) performed at 14-21 days of life, with subsequent tests at 1-2 months and 4-6 months of age. If any of these tests are positive, they confirm HIV infection in the infant.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Care:**\n   - Ensure the infant is seen regularly by a healthcare provider experienced in the care of infants at risk for HIV, for ongoing monitoring and assessment.\n\n4. **Counseling:**\n   - Provide the mother with counseling on the importance of adherence to her antiretroviral therapy and the need for follow-up care for both herself and her infant.\n\nGiven the mother's viral load of 678 copies/mL one week prior to delivery, indicating that her HIV is not optimally controlled, it is crucial to take these steps to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. The specifics of the treatment regimen and follow-up schedule should be tailored to the most current clinical guidelines and the infant's individual circumstances.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
