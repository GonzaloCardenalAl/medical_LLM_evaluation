    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "That's an interesting question about the early days of HIV treatment.\n\nIn 1990, the landscape of antiretroviral therapy was very different from today. At that time, only a very limited number of antiretroviral drugs were available, and combination therapy (using multiple drugs together) was not the standard approach.\n\nThe main, and likely only, frequently administered antiretroviral drug in 1990, including in Switzerland, was **zidovudine (AZT)**.\n\nTherefore, the concept of the \"five most frequently administered\" drugs doesn't really apply to 1990, as there simply weren't five distinct drugs widely in use. Treatment primarily relied on monotherapy with AZT.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "Unfortunately, I do not have access to specific historical prescription data for Switzerland from 2010. Drug utilization patterns can vary based on cohort studies, national databases, or pharmaceutical sales data, none of which I can directly access.\n\nTherefore, I cannot definitively tell you which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in that specific year.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific question about historical demographic data. While national birth rates are tracked, collecting data on birth rates specifically broken down by HIV status is complex and not typically reported in standard public health statistics.\n\nTo accurately compare the birth rate between women with and without HIV, you would need detailed data on:\n1.  The total number of births to women with HIV in Switzerland in 2010.\n2.  The total number of women with HIV of reproductive age in Switzerland in 2010.\n3.  Comparable data for the general female population without HIV.\n\nThis kind of detailed, population-wide comparison based on health status is not routinely collected or published in a way that allows for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer or a precise numerical difference. While data might exist within specific research studies or clinical cohorts, it's not a readily available statistic for the entire country's population in that year.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "That's a specific question comparing birth rates between two populations within Switzerland.\n\nWhile data is collected on the overall birth rate in Switzerland and on the number of births to women living with HIV (primarily for tracking mother-to-child transmission), public health statistics typically do not calculate and publish a direct, comparable *birth rate* specifically for women with HIV versus women without HIV using the same denominator (e.g., per 1,000 women of reproductive age) for a specific year like 2020.\n\nTherefore, a readily available statistic directly answering your question about the difference in overall birth *rate* between these two groups for Switzerland in 2020 is not typically compiled or reported. Differences in reproductive decisions, health status, access to care, and other factors may influence childbearing outcomes in women with HIV compared to the general population, but quantifying this as a standard birth rate difference for that specific year is not feasible with commonly available data.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Based on current data from Switzerland, the most common source of HIV infection is sexual contact among men who have sex with men (MSM).",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific question about a precise metric (proportion of *visits*) based solely on self-reported monthly adherence.\n\nWhile self-reported adherence is assessed regularly in clinical practice in Switzerland, standard national databases like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study typically report adherence differently \u2013 often as the proportion of patients achieving a high level of adherence (e.g., >95%) over a longer period, or focus on outcomes like viral suppression which are strongly linked to adherence.\n\nA precise statistic for the \"proportion of *visits* where a patient self-reported missing treatment at least once in the *preceding month*\" across the entire country based on a comprehensive, aggregated dataset is not a readily available or commonly reported metric. Therefore, I cannot provide that specific number.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "That's a specific question about psychosocial experiences. While stigma and feelings like guilt can unfortunately be associated with HIV for some individuals, this kind of specific emotional data (the proportion of PLWH reporting feeling guilty) is not routinely collected in standard epidemiological surveillance or clinical records.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a precise percentage for Switzerland from 2020 onwards. Data on such subjective experiences typically comes from dedicated psychosocial surveys, which may not be conducted frequently or publicly available with this specific detail broken down by year.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "That's a crucial question addressing the lived experience of PWH. Feelings of being treated like outcasts are a direct consequence of stigma, which unfortunately persists.\n\nHowever, finding a precise, publicly available statistic for the proportion of PWH in Switzerland who felt *exactly* like 'outcasts' in the specific year 2020 is difficult. Surveys on stigma and discrimination among PWH are conducted, but the exact wording of questions can vary, and comprehensive results for a specific feeling in a particular year might not always be published or readily accessible.\n\nWhile stigma remains a significant issue for many PWH globally and in Switzerland, I don't have the exact percentage you requested for 2020 based on a specific survey question using that precise phrase.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific epidemiological question.\n\nData on HIV in Switzerland is collected by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and through the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). While data is available on age at diagnosis and mortality among people living with HIV, the precise statistic you are asking for \u2013 the proportion of *HIV-related* deaths among PWH in Switzerland specifically for those diagnosed *before the age of 20* \u2013 is not a standard, readily published figure.\n\nTo get this number would require detailed analysis of death registry data linked with diagnosis data, filtering specifically for HIV-related causes of death and age at diagnosis. Such granular analysis might exist within the FOPH or the SHCS data but is not typically found in public reports.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide that specific proportion.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."

  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific epidemiological question requiring analysis of detailed data from a large cohort study in Switzerland covering that time period.\n\nWhile age can influence HIV progression, and specific cohorts like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) track these details, I am not aware of a readily available published analysis that specifically examines the difference in time to CD4 < 200 cells/mm\u00b3 comparing individuals diagnosed before versus after age 20, *specifically* within that 1990-2010 timeframe in Switzerland, *and* restricted to those with initial CD4 > 300.\n\nTherefore, I cannot definitively answer whether such a difference has been demonstrated in a published study. It would require a dedicated analysis of the relevant cohort data.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
