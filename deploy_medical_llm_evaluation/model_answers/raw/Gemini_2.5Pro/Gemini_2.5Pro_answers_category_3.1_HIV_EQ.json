    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "This clinical picture, especially with severe immunosuppression (CD4 75), progressive neurological deficits, the characteristic MRI findings of multiple asymmetric non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect, and the brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes, is highly suggestive of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nPML is caused by the JC virus and is a demyelinating disease that typically occurs in individuals with significant cellular immunodeficiency, such as advanced HIV infection with low CD4 counts. The non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy explains her profound immunosuppression.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient presents with a new focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness) in the setting of advanced HIV (CD4: 77), fever, and inconsistent ART adherence. This presentation raises concern for several serious conditions, including but not limited to stroke, CNS opportunistic infections (such as Toxoplasmosis, Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy [PML], Cryptococcoma), and Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThe next best step in management is **Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Neuroimaging is essential:** To determine the cause of the focal neurological deficit, imaging of the brain is required to identify stroke, mass lesions, or inflammatory changes.\n2.  **Broad Differential:** Given the advanced HIV and fever, opportunistic infections and PCNSL are highly likely possibilities in addition to vascular events.\n3.  **Superiority of MRI:** Contrast-enhanced MRI is superior to CT for visualizing subtle infarcts, demyelinating lesions (like PML), ring-enhancing lesions (typical of Toxoplasmosis or abscess), and uniformly enhancing lesions (typical of PCNSL). A non-contrast CT can rule out hemorrhage quickly but may miss other pathologies evident on MRI.\n4.  **Guiding Further Management:** The findings on MRI will guide subsequent steps, such as urgent treatment (e.g., for stroke if ischemic, or empiric antibiotics/antiparasitics), or further diagnostic procedures like lumbar puncture or biopsy.\n\nWhile a non-contrast Head CT might be performed first in some settings, particularly if considering thrombolysis for a very acute stroke presentation or needing to rapidly rule out hemorrhage or significant mass effect prior to LP, the clinical picture here (fever, advanced immunosuppression, potentially subacute/worsening symptoms) makes non-vascular opportunistic diseases a high probability. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the most definitive initial imaging study to evaluate for the range of potential causes in this specific patient.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, advanced HIV, and the characteristic skin biopsy findings (vascular proliferation with bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain), the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis, caused by *Bartonella* species.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy involves antibiotics targeting *Bartonella*.\n\nPrimary options include:\n*   **Doxycycline**\n*   **Erythromycin** or other macrolides (e.g., Azithromycin)\n\nTreatment duration typically ranges from several weeks to months, depending on the extent and severity of the disease. Given the systemic symptoms and multiple lesions, a prolonged course is usually necessary.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is doxycycline, erythromycin, or azithromycin for bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Based on the description of painless, skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions on the penile shaft and around the anus that turn white with acetic acid application in a patient with a history of HIV and multiple sexual partners, the etiology of these lesions is most likely **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**. These findings are classic for anogenital warts.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This clinical presentation, occurring after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a patient with treated pulmonary tuberculosis and evidence of immune recovery (rising CD4, falling viral load, positive Mantoux conversion), is highly suggestive of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS).\n\nThe most appropriate initial step in treatment is to add corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory response. Continue both the antitubercular therapy and the ART.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's poorly controlled HIV, African-American ethnicity, and significant proteinuria, the most likely etiology is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). This condition is a severe form of kidney disease that can occur in people with HIV, particularly those with uncontrolled infection.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "This patient presents with a complex picture highly suggestive of **syphilis**, specifically involving the nervous system (neurosyphilis presenting with Argyll Robertson pupils and ataxia) and the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular syphilis presenting with aortic regurgitation and likely aortic root dilation/aneurysm causing the widened mediastinum). His non-adherent HIV status makes him more susceptible to severe manifestations of opportunistic infections like syphilis.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is **Syphilis (Neurosyphilis and Cardiovascular Syphilis)**.\n\nThe therapy to treat the underlying infection and halt the progression of these pathological abnormalities is **intravenous Penicillin G**, given at a dose and duration appropriate for neurosyphilis. This treatment targets the *Treponema pallidum* infection causing the disease process, rather than specific metabolic abnormalities. Structural damage already present (like severe aortic regurgitation or nerve damage) may not be fully reversible with treatment.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)**.\n\nThis is supported by:\n*   The patient has a high-grade, bulky lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma), which has a high cell turnover.\n*   She developed symptoms and laboratory abnormalities shortly after initiating chemotherapy, which rapidly kills cancer cells.\n*   The laboratory findings show acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine and BUN), severe hyperuricemia, and severe hyperkalemia, which are hallmarks of TLS caused by the rapid release of intracellular contents from dying tumor cells.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
