    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "That's a good question that highlights how much HIV treatment has evolved.\n\nIn 1990, the landscape of antiretroviral therapy was vastly different from today. Combination therapy, as we know it, did not exist.\n\nAt that time, the primary, and often only, antiretroviral drug available and administered was **Zidovudine (AZT)**. While other drugs were in development or early trials, they were not widely available or frequently administered in clinical practice like AZT was.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to list five frequently administered antiretroviral drugs for 1990, as the concept of using multiple drugs concurrently was not the standard, and the drugs themselves were not yet available.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "As a physician, I do not have access to specific historical prescription data like the most frequently administered drugs in a particular country and year.\n\nThis kind of information is typically gathered and published by national health authorities, statistical offices, or specific research cohorts monitoring HIV treatment trends (like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study).\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide you with the list of the five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland in 2010. You would need to consult reports or publications from relevant Swiss health or research institutions from that time period.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "It is not possible to provide a direct statistical comparison of the overall birth rate specifically broken down by HIV status for women in Switzerland in 2010.\n\nNational birth rate statistics are typically collected for the overall population or by standard demographics like age and region, but not by specific medical conditions like HIV status. Data on HIV status is highly sensitive and not part of routine birth registration or national demographic surveys used to calculate these rates.\n\nTherefore, official statistics that would allow for a direct comparison of the birth rate between these two groups of women in that specific year are not available.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

  {
    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific statistical question.\n\nWhile data exists for the overall birth rate in Switzerland in 2020 and data is collected on births to women living with HIV (often for preventing mother-to-child transmission), a readily available, directly comparable statistic on the *overall birth rate per capita* specifically contrasting women *with* HIV versus women *without* HIV for that particular year is not a standard, easily accessible public health figure.\n\nCalculating such a figure would require detailed demographic data on both populations of women of childbearing age, which is complex to compile and often not published in a simple comparative statistic.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Based on current data from Switzerland, the most common source of HIV infection is sexual contact.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific question looking for data on the proportion of *visits* where a patient self-reports missing treatment at least once in the past month.\n\nWhile data on HIV treatment adherence in Switzerland, particularly from sources like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), indicates high rates of viral suppression and overall good adherence among patients, the exact statistic you are asking for is not a standard metric that is routinely published or readily available.\n\nAdherence data is often collected at visits, but analysis typically focuses on the proportion of *patients* achieving high levels of adherence over a period (e.g., >95% adherence), rather than the proportion of individual *visits* meeting a specific low adherence threshold like \"missed at least once last month.\" Adherence can also fluctuate between visits for the same patient.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a precise figure for the proportion of visits fitting this description based on currently available aggregate data.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific question about the emotional experience of living with HIV. While it's known that some people living with HIV may experience feelings like guilt, often related to internalized stigma or circumstances surrounding acquisition, obtaining a precise *proportion* of people in Switzerland who specifically reported feeling 'guilty *because* they have HIV' for the year 2020 is not something that is routinely tracked or reported in standard epidemiological data or public health statistics.\n\nSuch data would typically come from specific, detailed psychosocial surveys, which are not conducted every year across the entire population of PLWH. Therefore, I don't have a reliable statistic for that specific question.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "Finding an exact proportion of people with HIV in Switzerland who felt 'treated like outcasts' specifically from 2020 surveys using that precise phrasing is difficult. While surveys on stigma among PWH exist and show that stigma remains a concern, this specific metric isn't a standard, readily available statistic from that timeframe. Data from such surveys often focus on broader categories of discrimination or perceived negative attitudes rather than this exact phrasing.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific epidemiological question. While data is collected in Switzerland on HIV diagnoses by age and on causes of death among people with HIV, the precise statistic you are asking for \u2013 the proportion of those who died specifically from HIV-related causes who also had their first positive test before the age of 20 \u2013 is not a standard, readily published figure.\n\nThis level of detailed cross-analysis linking age at diagnosis to cause of death within the specific subgroup of HIV-related deaths would typically require a dedicated analysis of national cohort or surveillance data and is not something generally reported in routine public health statistics. Therefore, I cannot provide that specific proportion.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."

  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific question requiring detailed analysis of longitudinal data from a cohort like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) covering that specific period (1990-2010).\n\nAnswering precisely whether there's a statistically significant difference in the time it took for CD4 counts to drop below 200 in individuals diagnosed with initial CD4 > 300, based solely on whether they were diagnosed before or after age 20 during that particular timeframe, would necessitate performing or referencing a specific analysis of that dataset.\n\nFactors like changing treatment guidelines during that period (introduction and evolution of HAART) would also significantly influence the time course of CD4 decline, making such an analysis complex and requiring careful consideration of treatment initiation times.\n\nWithout access to and analysis of that specific cohort data, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on general knowledge or readily available summary statistics.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
