    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, HIV treatment was still in its very early stages. Only a limited number of antiretroviral drugs were available, and standard treatment typically involved monotherapy (using a single drug), not combinations of multiple drugs, let alone five.\n\nThe most frequently administered and widely available antiretroviral drug in 1990, both in Switzerland and globally, was **Zidovudine (AZT)**.\n\nOther drugs were either not yet approved, only available in clinical trials, or not yet standard practice for combination therapy, which became common much later in the 1990s. Therefore, it's not possible to list five \"most frequently administered\" drugs as only one (AZT) fits that description for that year.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "Determining the exact top five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland for a specific year like 2010 requires access to detailed national prescription or dispensing data from that time.\n\nThis specific data isn't something I have readily available. Such information would typically be found in national health statistics, pharmacy records, or specific epidemiological reports published by Swiss public health authorities or research institutions covering that period.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide the precise list you requested.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "That specific comparison \u2013 the overall birth rate in the entire population of women with HIV versus the entire population of women without HIV for Switzerland in 2010 \u2013 is not a statistic that is routinely collected or published.\n\nNational birth rate data is typically collected by age, region, etc., but not based on confidential medical information like HIV status. Therefore, I cannot provide you with a direct comparison of the overall birth rates for these two groups.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

  {
    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "That's an interesting question comparing specific sub-populations. While overall birth rates for countries like Switzerland are standard demographic data, statistics bodies typically report the birth rate for the *entire* population or by broader demographics, not specifically broken down and compared between women *with* HIV and women *without* HIV.\n\nPublic health data in Switzerland would track the number of people living with HIV, and data related to births to women with HIV (like mother-to-child transmission rates), but it doesn't usually calculate and publish a specific \"birth rate\" (live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age) *solely for the group of women with HIV* compared directly to that *solely for the group of women without HIV*.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide you with a figure showing the difference in *overall birth rate* specifically between these two distinct groups for 2020, as this specific statistic is not routinely compiled or publicly available in that format.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Based on recent epidemiological data from Switzerland, the most common route of HIV transmission among new diagnoses is sexual contact between men (MSM). Heterosexual contact is also a significant route.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific question focusing on visit-level data linked to self-reported adherence frequency per month in Switzerland.\n\nWhile studies track adherence rates and factors influencing them in Switzerland and elsewhere, a single, publicly available statistic for the *proportion of visits* across the country fitting this precise description (self-reported missed dose at least once per month) is not readily available.\n\nAdherence data is often collected at specific points in time within studies or clinics, and the frequency of reporting can vary. Aggregating this to a national \"proportion of visits\" with this specific self-reported pattern would require a dedicated, large-scale collection effort.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

  {
    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific question about the emotional experience of people living with HIV in Switzerland. While studies and surveys do look at the mental health and quality of life among people with HIV, including experiences of stigma and shame, finding a precise, published statistic on the *proportion* of PLWH in Switzerland who specifically reported feeling 'guilty' in 2020 or any year since is not information that is typically collected or reported as a standard public health metric.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a specific number or proportion for that feeling. However, I can say that feelings of guilt, shame, or self-blame are unfortunately not uncommon experiences for some individuals living with HIV, often linked to societal stigma surrounding the virus. Support services and mental health resources are important in addressing these feelings.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "Finding the exact proportion of people living with HIV in Switzerland who considered themselves 'treated like outcasts' specifically in 2020 is challenging.\n\nWhile studies and reports on HIV stigma and discrimination in Switzerland are conducted, the wording and timing of surveys vary. A precise statistic for that exact question and year is not readily available in general public reports I can access.\n\nData on experiences of stigma and discrimination is collected, but it might be phrased differently or be from surveys conducted in slightly different years.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific epidemiological question requiring granular data linkage between national death registries and HIV surveillance data, including detailed cause of death and age at diagnosis.\n\nI do not have access to a precise, published statistic that answers exactly what proportion of people with HIV dying from HIV-related causes in Switzerland were diagnosed before age 20.\n\nThis type of analysis would typically come from national public health surveillance bodies (like the Federal Office of Public Health) or large, comprehensive cohort studies (like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study). While these bodies collect relevant data, this specific proportion is not a standard, readily available figure.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a number for this specific proportion.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."

  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "That is a very specific question about a particular cohort of people living with HIV in Switzerland.\n\nTo answer whether there is a difference in the time it took for the CD4 count to drop below 200 between those tested before or after age 20, within the defined group (Switzerland, diagnosis 1990-2010, initial CD4 > 300), one would need access to detailed data from a specific study or cohort analysis, such as the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, that has specifically investigated this outcome stratified by age at testing.\n\nAs a general medical practitioner, I do not have immediate access to the specific statistical results of such a detailed analysis from that precise cohort. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether such a difference exists based on publicly available general medical knowledge.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
