    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed using tests that look for evidence of the virus in the body. The most common methods are:\n\n1.  **Combination Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These blood tests detect both HIV antibodies (produced by the body in response to the virus) and the p24 antigen (a protein from the virus). They are highly accurate and can detect infection earlier than antibody-only tests.\n2.  **Rapid Antibody Tests:** These can use blood (fingerstick) or oral fluid and provide results quickly (often 20-30 minutes). They are primarily screening tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT/PCR):** These tests detect the actual genetic material of the virus. They are used for diagnosing acute infection (very early stages) or for confirming positive results from other tests.\n\nAny positive screening test (like a rapid antibody test) always requires a confirmatory test, typically a combination antigen/antibody test or a NAT, to ensure accuracy.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV infection typically progresses through three stages if left untreated:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Many people have flu-like symptoms during this time. There is a high viral load.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** This stage can last for many years. The virus is still active but reproduces at lower levels. People may have no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild ones. With effective treatment (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when HIV has severely damaged the immune system. It is defined by a low CD4 count (below 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, survival is typically about three years.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "Even with effective HIV treatment, people living with HIV are at increased risk for certain comorbidities. Some common ones include:\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular disease:** Higher risk of heart attack and stroke.\n2.  **Kidney disease:** Chronic kidney disease.\n3.  **Liver disease:** Often related to viral hepatitis co-infection (HBV/HCV) or fatty liver disease.\n4.  **Bone disease:** Osteoporosis and osteopenia.\n5.  **Neurological disorders:** Including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).\n6.  **Certain Cancers:** Both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining cancers.\n7.  **Metabolic syndrome:** Including dyslipidemia and diabetes.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "There are several effective strategies to prevent HIV transmission:\n\n1.  **Using condoms** consistently and correctly during sexual activity.\n2.  **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Taking specific HIV medication before potential exposure.\n3.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Taking specific HIV medication shortly after potential exposure.\n4.  **Not sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment.**\n5.  **Ensuring blood transfusions and organ transplants are screened.**\n6.  **Using antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding** for mothers with HIV to prevent transmission to the child.\n7.  **Treatment as Prevention (TasP):** People with HIV who take their medication as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load effectively cannot sexually transmit HIV.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

  {
    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Most Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) regimens are taken **once daily**. Some specific regimens may require dosing twice daily, but this is less common now. The frequency depends entirely on the specific medications prescribed. Adhering strictly to the prescribed schedule is crucial for effectiveness.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "Okay, this is a fundamental distinction.\n\n1.  **HIV** stands for **Human Immunodeficiency Virus**. It is the **virus** itself. HIV attacks and weakens the immune system, specifically targeting CD4 T cells.\n2.  **AIDS** stands for **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome**. It is the **most advanced stage** of HIV infection. AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has severely damaged the immune system, typically defined by a very low CD4 cell count or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers that indicate severe immune deficiency.\n\nSo, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS is the condition that develops as a result of untreated, progressive HIV infection. With effective treatment (ART), most people with HIV do not progress to AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is a bloodborne virus and is transmitted through specific body fluids during certain activities. It is **not** transmitted through:\n\n*   Air or water\n*   Insects like mosquitoes\n*   Saliva, tears, or sweat (unless mixed with the blood of a person with a high viral load)\n*   Casual contact such as hugging, kissing (social or dry), shaking hands, or sharing utensils, towels, or bedding\n*   Using toilets, swimming pools, or hot tubs",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "That \"switch\" you refer to is essentially the **reactivation of the latent HIV reservoir**.\n\nHere's what is known:\n\n1.  **Latency:** HIV can integrate into the DNA of certain cells (primarily resting CD4+ T cells) and remain dormant, not actively replicating. This is the latent reservoir.\n2.  **Reactivation:** This dormant virus can be triggered to become active and start replicating again.\n3.  **The Trigger:** The primary trigger for this switch from latency to active replication is **cellular activation**.\n4.  **Causes of Activation:** When a latent infected cell (like a resting CD4+ T cell) becomes activated (e.g., by exposure to an antigen during an infection, inflammation, or other immune stimuli), the conditions inside the cell become favorable for the integrated HIV DNA to be transcribed and translated, leading to the production of new virus particles.\n\nSo, the switch isn't an internal clock, but rather the cell hosting the latent virus receiving a signal to become metabolically active, which in turn allows the virus to resume replication. This process of reservoir reactivation is a major barrier to curing HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
