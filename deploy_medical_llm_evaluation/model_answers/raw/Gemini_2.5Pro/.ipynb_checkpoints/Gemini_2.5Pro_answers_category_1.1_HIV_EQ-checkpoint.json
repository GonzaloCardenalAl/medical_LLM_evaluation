    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": [
      "HIV is diagnosed using tests that detect antibodies to HIV, antigens (like p24), or the virus's genetic material (RNA).\n\nThe main types of tests include:\n\n1.  **Antibody Tests:** Detect antibodies the body produces in response to HIV infection. Can use blood, oral fluid, or urine.\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests:** Detect both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen (a protein of the virus). Often preferred as they can detect infection sooner than antibody-only tests. Usually done with blood.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs) / RNA Tests:** Directly detect the virus's RNA. Can detect infection earliest, often used for confirming other test results, or for screening in specific situations (like blood donation). Done with blood.\n\nDiagnosis typically involves an initial screening test (often antigen/antibody) followed by a confirmatory test if the initial test is positive or indeterminate.",

    ],
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": [
      "There are typically three main stages of HIV infection without treatment:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV:** The initial phase, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Some people experience flu-like symptoms, but many have no symptoms. The virus is multiplying rapidly.\n2.  **Chronic HIV (Clinical Latency):** The asymptomatic period. The virus is still active but reproduces at a much lower level. This stage can last for many years, even decades, with treatment. Without treatment, it progresses more quickly.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** The most advanced stage of HIV infection. It occurs when the immune system is severely damaged, typically defined by a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or the presence of certain opportunistic infections or cancers.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively control the virus and prevent progression through these stages, maintaining the person's health and preventing the development of AIDS.",

      true
    ],
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

Elective cesarean section might be considered if the viral load is high near delivery.\n4.  **Safe infant feeding:** Avoiding breastfeeding if safe and sustainable alternatives (like formula feeding) are available is recommended in settings where this is feasible.

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": [
      "That's a good question that gets to the heart of why HIV is so difficult to cure.\n\nWhen we talk about \"latent HIV,\" we usually mean the virus that has integrated its genetic material into the DNA of certain cells (primarily CD4+ T cells) but is not actively producing new virus particles. This state is often referred to as the **viral reservoir**.\n\nThe \"switch\" you're asking about is the process of **reactivation**. This happens when these reservoir cells become activated, often in response to the immune system encountering antigens or inflammatory signals. When the cell is activated, it starts transcribing its DNA, and unfortunately, it also starts transcribing the integrated HIV DNA.\n\nThis transcription leads to the production of viral RNA and proteins, assembling new virus particles. If these cells are not suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART), the newly produced virus can go on to infect other cells, leading to active infection and a rising viral load.\n\nSo, the transition isn't a simple on/off switch like a light, but rather the return to active viral production from integrated provirus, primarily triggered by the activation of the host reservoir cell. This persistence of the reservoir is a major challenge for achieving an HIV cure.",
      true
    ],
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
