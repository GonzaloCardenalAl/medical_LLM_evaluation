    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is primarily diagnosed through blood tests that detect antibodies to the virus, antigens (like p24 antigen), or the virus's genetic material (RNA).\n\nInitial screening tests often look for both antibodies and antigens. If the screening test is positive, a more specific confirmatory test is performed to ensure the diagnosis. Rapid tests are also available and can be followed by laboratory confirmation if positive.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV infection typically progresses through three stages if left untreated:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV:** This is the earliest stage, usually within 2-4 weeks after infection. Many people experience flu-like symptoms. The virus is multiplying rapidly and is highly contagious.\n2.  **Chronic HIV (Clinical Latency):** In this stage, the virus is still active but reproduces at very low levels. People may not have symptoms for many years. With antiretroviral therapy (ART), people can stay in this stage and live long, healthy lives without progressing to AIDS.\n3.  **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome):** This is the most severe stage. The immune system is severely damaged, making the person susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. A diagnosis of AIDS is made when the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or if specific opportunistic infections occur.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "Common comorbidities among people living with HIV include:\n\n*   Cardiovascular disease (CVD)\n*   Metabolic disorders (such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance/diabetes)\n*   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n*   Bone disorders (like osteoporosis)\n*   Certain malignancies (cancers), both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining\n*   Liver disease (often related to viral hepatitis co-infection, but also non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)\n*   Mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety)",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several effective methods:\n\n1.  **Use condoms correctly and consistently** during sexual activity.\n2.  **Take Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Medication taken by HIV-negative individuals to prevent infection.\n3.  **Take Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**: Medication taken after potential exposure to prevent infection.\n4.  **Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)**: People with HIV who are on effective treatment and have an undetectable viral load cannot transmit the virus to others.\n5.  **Never share needles, syringes, or other injection equipment**.\n6.  **Prevent mother-to-child transmission** by using antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breastfeeding.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Most commonly, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is taken once daily.\n\nHowever, some regimens may be taken twice daily. Newer injectable options allow for less frequent dosing (e.g., monthly or every two months).\n\nThe precise frequency depends entirely on the specific medication(s) prescribed. Consistent adherence to the prescribed schedule is crucial for effectiveness. Always follow the instructions provided with the specific regimen.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "That's a crucial distinction to understand.\n\n**HIV** (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that infects cells of the immune system, primarily CD4 T cells.\n\n**AIDS** (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. It's defined by the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers, or a severely low CD4 cell count, indicating significant damage to the immune system caused by the virus.\n\nSo, HIV is the cause, and AIDS is the severe, late-stage condition that results from untreated HIV infection. With effective treatment, most people with HIV never progress to AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is not transmitted through casual contact. This includes activities such as:\n\n*   Shaking hands, hugging, or closed-mouth kissing.\n*   Sharing eating utensils, towels, or bedding.\n*   Using the same toilet, shower, or swimming pool.\n*   Being bitten by insects like mosquitoes or ticks.\n*   Through air, water, or food.\n*   Sweat, tears, or saliva (unless there are open sores or cuts).",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "That's a good question, but it's important to clarify the terms slightly. HIV infection itself is typically active shortly after transmission, leading to an active, replicating infection. Latency refers to a state where some virus has integrated into the DNA of certain host cells, but those specific cells are not actively producing new virus particles. This creates a \"reservoir\" of inactive virus.\n\nThe switch isn't from a whole-body latent state to an active state in the sense of primary infection. Instead, it's about what causes the *reactivation* of the virus specifically from these latent reservoir cells.\n\nWhat is known is that various stimuli can trigger these latent cells to become active and start producing new virus. These stimuli often involve general immune activation, such as:\n\n1.  **Infections:** Other viral, bacterial, or fungal infections.\n2.  **Inflammatory signals:** Cytokines and other molecules released during immune responses.\n3.  **Cellular activation:** Activation of the specific immune cells (like CD4+ T cells) that harbor the latent virus.\n\nSo, the \"switch\" is the process of reactivating the silent virus from these specific reservoir cells, often driven by signals that tell the cell to become active and divide, which in turn can trigger the virus to replicate. Research is ongoing to fully understand and target these mechanisms.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
