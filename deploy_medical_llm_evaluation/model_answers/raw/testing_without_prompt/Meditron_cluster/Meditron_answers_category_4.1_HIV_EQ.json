    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "|||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id|||\n\nThis patient's presentation is suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS. The treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate. However, the elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture suggests increased intracranial pressure, which can be life-threatening. In this case, repeated lumbar punctures to reduce intracranial pressure may be warranted, along with careful monitoring of the patient's neurological status.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "|||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id|||\n\n## Calculating the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a Novel AIDS Screening Test\n\n### Background:\nTo determine the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a novel AIDS screening test, we need to understand the following concepts:\n\n* **True Negatives (TN)**: Patients who do not have AIDS and test negative on the screening examination.\n* **False Negatives (FN)**: Patients who have AIDS but test negative on the screening examination.\n\n### Study Data:\n- **AIDS Patients (n=250)**:\n  - Positive Screening Results: 240\n  - Negative Screening Results: 10 (False Negatives)\n- **Control Arm (n=250)**:\n  - Positive Screening Results: 5\n  - Negative Screening Results: 245 (True Negatives)\n\n### Calculating NPV:\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\n### Substituting Values:\n- TN = 245 (True Negatives in the control arm)\n- FN = 10 (False Negatives in the AIDS patient group)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV = 245 / 255\nNPV = 0.96\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening test is 0.96, indicating that 96% of patients who test negative on the screening examination do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "|||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id|||\n\nThe patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one extremity, fever, and history of HIV infection raises concern for an opportunistic infection such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis. Given his fever and neurological symptoms, he should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. The next best step would be to obtain a lumbar puncture to evaluate for possible central nervous system infection. Additionally, the patient's HIV regimen should be reviewed and optimized, and he should be started on appropriate antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infections.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "|||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id||||eot_id||start_header_id|||\n\nThis patient's clinical presentation, including cognitive decline, personality changes, and motor deficits, in the context of advanced HIV disease with a low CD4+ count, is suggestive of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect further support this diagnosis. HAND is a common complication of HIV infection, particularly in individuals with advanced immunosuppression. The patient's positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG suggests prior exposure, but this is not indicative of active toxoplasmosis, which typically presents with focal neurological deficits and enhancing lesions on MRI. Cryptococcal antigen is negative, ruling out cryptococcal meningitis. Other differentials such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and primary CNS lymphoma are less likely given the MRI findings and the absence of specific diagnostic markers.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
