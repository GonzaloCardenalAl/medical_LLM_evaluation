    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through several testing methods:\n\n1. Standard HIV tests:\n- Blood tests that detect HIV antibodies and antigens\n- Results typically available in 1-3 days\n- Most accurate 3 months after potential exposure\n\n2. Rapid HIV tests:\n- Results available in 20-30 minutes\n- Can use blood from finger prick or oral fluid\n- May need confirmation with standard testing\n\n3. Home testing kits:\n- Available over-the-counter\n- Self-administered\n- Results in 20-40 minutes\n\nTests look for:\n- HIV antibodies (proteins made by immune system)\n- HIV antigens (part of the virus itself)\n- HIV genetic material (RNA)\n\nTesting is recommended:\n- After potential exposure\n- As part of routine healthcare\n- During pregnancy\n- If experiencing HIV-related symptoms\n\nEarly diagnosis is important for:\n- Beginning treatment promptly\n- Preventing transmission to others\n- Better health outcomes\n- Accessing appropriate medical care",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several methods:\n\n1. Safe Sex Practices:\n- Using condoms correctly and consistently\n- Getting tested regularly with sexual partners\n- Limiting sexual partners\n- Abstaining from sexual activity\n\n2. Medical Prevention:\n- PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) for high-risk individuals\n- PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) within 72 hours of potential exposure\n- Prevention of mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy/childbirth\n\n3. Avoiding Shared Needles:\n- Using clean needles for medical procedures\n- Not sharing needles for drug use\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n\n4. Blood Screening:\n- Testing donated blood\n- Using screened blood products\n\n5. Other Preventive Measures:\n- Getting tested and knowing your status\n- Early treatment if infected\n- Education about HIV transmission\n- Open communication with partners\n- Not sharing personal items that may have blood contact (razors, toothbrushes)\n\n6. Healthcare Settings:\n- Universal precautions\n- Proper sterilization of medical equipment\n- Safe disposal of medical waste\n\nRemember: Early detection and treatment can help prevent transmission to others.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."
