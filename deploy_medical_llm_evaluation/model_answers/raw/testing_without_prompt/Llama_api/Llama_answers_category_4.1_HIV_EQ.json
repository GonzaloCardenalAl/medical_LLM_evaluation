    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and laboratory results, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is appropriate for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of adjunctive corticosteroids, specifically prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to manage any potential cerebral edema. However, the more critical additional treatment is repeated lumbar punctures to manage elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe elevated opening pressure of 285 mm H2O on the initial lumbar puncture suggests increased ICP, which is a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis. Repeated lumbar punctures may be necessary to relieve the elevated ICP and prevent further complications, such as brain herniation or visual loss. This is typically done until the opening pressure is reduced to a safe range.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of increased ICP, such as worsening headache, vision changes, or altered mental status, and managed accordingly.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we need to understand what NPV represents. The NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who are truly free of the disease. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\n1. **True Positives (TP)**: 240 patients with confirmed AIDS tested positive.\n2. **False Positives (FP)**: 5 patients without AIDS tested positive.\n3. **True Negatives (TN)**: Since 5 out of 250 patients without AIDS tested positive, 250 - 5 = 245 patients without AIDS tested negative.\n4. **False Negatives (FN)**: Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 250 - 240 = 10 patients with AIDS tested negative.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n     = 245 / (245 + 10)\n     = 245 / 255\n     = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nTherefore, the negative predictive value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96.08%, meaning that about 96.08% of individuals who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the clinical suspicion for an infectious or inflammatory process, particularly involving the central nervous system (CNS), is high. The patient's inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a history of opportunistic infections (such as pneumonia) further increase the risk for CNS infections or other complications related to HIV.\n\nThe next best step in management would involve several concurrent actions:\n\n1. **Immediate Neuroimaging**: Given the focal neurological deficit (weakness in one hand), an urgent MRI of the brain is crucial to rule out conditions such as a stroke, CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which are more common in immunocompromised patients.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: \n   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for signs of infection or inflammation.\n   - **Blood Cultures**: To identify any systemic infection.\n   - **HIV Viral Load**: To assess the current level of viral suppression.\n   - **CD4 Count**: Although the patient's CD4 count is known, monitoring changes can be helpful.\n   - **Toxoplasma IgG**: To assess for toxoplasmosis, a common cause of CNS lesions in HIV patients.\n   - **JC Virus PCR**: To consider PML, especially if the MRI suggests this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Empirical Treatment**:\n   - **Antipyretics**: For fever management.\n   - **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be started pending culture results, especially if there's suspicion of bacterial infection.\n   - **Antiepileptic Drugs**: If there's a concern for seizures, particularly if the patient has a history of seizure or if the imaging suggests a lesion that could cause seizures.\n\n4. **Consultations**:\n   - **Neurology**: For further evaluation and guidance on management of the neurological condition.\n   - **Infectious Disease**: Given the patient's HIV status and potential for opportunistic infections, early involvement of an infectious disease specialist is crucial.\n\n5. **Adherence to ART**:\n   - Ensuring the patient is on effective ART and encouraging adherence is critical for improving immune function and reducing the risk of opportunistic infections.\n\n6. **Supportive Care**:\n   - **Hydration**: Ensure the patient is well-hydrated, especially if feverish.\n   - **Monitoring**: Close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status for any changes.\n\nThe management of this patient requires a multidisciplinary approach, considering the complexity of HIV infection, potential for opportunistic infections, and the need for both diagnostic clarification and therapeutic intervention.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **Clinical presentation**: The patient has a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls, which suggests a progressive neurological decline. Additionally, he has become more forgetful, has difficulty with daily activities, and has developed psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia, agitation, and restlessness.\n2. **HIV status and immune suppression**: The patient has HIV with a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL), indicating severe immune suppression. This increases his risk for opportunistic infections and neurological disorders.\n3. **Neuroimaging findings**: The MRI shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect, which is consistent with PML. PML is a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which affects the white matter of the brain.\n4. **Laboratory results**: The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his HIV infection and immune suppression. The negative cryptococcal antigen and positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG results help to rule out other opportunistic infections.\n5. **Lack of mass effect**: The absence of mass effect on the MRI suggests that the lesions are not caused by a space-occupying lesion, such as a tumor or abscess, which further supports the diagnosis of PML.\n\nOther possible diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or CNS lymphoma, are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings. Toxoplasmosis typically presents with enhancing lesions on MRI, and CNS lymphoma often presents with a more aggressive clinical course and mass effect on imaging.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the patient's clinical presentation, HIV status, immune suppression, and characteristic neuroimaging findings make Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At the first prenatal visit, several tests and screenings are recommended to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Given the information provided, the following tests should be considered for this 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation:\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and other blood disorders.\n2. **Blood Type and Rh Factor:** Determining the woman's blood type and Rh factor is crucial. If she is Rh-negative, her partner's Rh status may need to be determined to assess the risk of Rh incompatibility.\n3. **Rubella Titer:** To confirm immunity to rubella (German measles), as infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital rubella syndrome.\n4. **Varicella Titer:** To assess immunity to varicella (chickenpox), as severe varicella infection can occur in non-immune pregnant women.\n5. **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):** Screening for hepatitis B infection.\n6. **Syphilis Screening:** A non-treponemal test (e.g., RPR or VDRL) to screen for syphilis.\n7. **Urine Analysis and Culture:** To check for urinary tract infections (UTIs) or asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to serious complications if left untreated during pregnancy.\n8. **Pap Smear (if due):** If the patient's last Pap smear was not within the last 3 years or if her screening history is unknown, a Pap smear may be recommended, though guidelines often suggest it can be deferred until after pregnancy if recently normal.\n9. **Ultrasound:** An early ultrasound can confirm gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and identify potential complications early on.\n10. **HIV Screening:** Even though she tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend HIV screening for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, regardless of previous test results, due to the potential for new exposure.\n11. **Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends screening for these infections in all pregnant women under the age of 25, as well as in older women at increased risk. Even though she tested negative 4 years ago, her age puts her in the category for routine screening.\n12. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening:** Typically performed between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation, but initial prenatal visits often set the stage for understanding the need for this screening later in pregnancy.\n\nIt's also essential to discuss and offer screening for genetic disorders based on the patient's age, family history, and ethnic background. This includes carrier screening for conditions like cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as considerations for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities) if she is at increased risk due to age or other factors.\n\nEach of these tests and screenings serves to provide a comprehensive overview of the patient's health and to identify any potential risks or complications early in the pregnancy, allowing for timely management and intervention if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to depression, it's essential to consider medications that will help prevent opportunistic infections (OIs) and manage his mental health. \n\nFor opportunistic infection prophylaxis, the following medications are recommended:\n\n1. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: This is the first-line medication for preventing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common OI in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n2. **Azithromycin**: This may be considered for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is recommended for patients with CD4+ counts < 50 cells/mm3.\n\nFor depression management:\n\n1. **Antidepressant medications**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine are commonly used to treat depression in HIV-positive patients. However, it's crucial to choose an SSRI that has a low potential for interacting with the patient's ART regimen.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n1. **Vitamin and mineral supplements**: Ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition and consider supplements such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calcium.\n2. **Mental health support**: Refer the patient to a mental health professional for counseling and support to address his depression and improve adherence to ART.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's ART regimen should be re-initiated as soon as possible, and the patient should be closely monitored for potential side effects and interactions between his ART medications and any new medications prescribed.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain in the skin lesion biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is azithromycin or doxycycline. The recommended treatment regimen is:\n\n* Azithromycin: 500 mg orally daily for 3 months\n* Doxycycline: 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 months\n\nErythromycin is also an alternative treatment option, but it is less commonly used due to its gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (98/mm3) indicate a compromised immune system, which increases her risk for opportunistic infections such as BA. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be optimized to improve her immune function and reduce the risk of future opportunistic infections.\n\nIn addition to treating the BA, the patient's substance use disorder and malnutrition should also be addressed. She should be referred to a substance abuse treatment program and receive counseling and support to help her quit using crack cocaine. Nutritional supplements and counseling may also be necessary to help her regain weight and improve her overall health.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key findings that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, which are common symptoms of a brain tumor or mass lesion.\n2. **HIV status and antiretroviral therapy**: The patient has a history of HIV infection and was not consistently taking his antiretroviral medications until recently. This immunocompromised state increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n3. **Neurological examination**: The patient shows ataxia (loss of coordination) and apathy, which are consistent with a brain lesion affecting motor function and cognitive processing.\n4. **Mini-Mental State Examination score**: A score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment, which is consistent with a brain tumor or mass lesion.\n5. **Laboratory studies**: The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low (90/\u03bcL), indicating a compromised immune system.\n6. **MRI findings**: The solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is a characteristic imaging feature of PCNSL.\n7. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis (increased cell count) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder, which is consistent with PCNSL. EBV is a known risk factor for PCNSL in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nPrimary Central Nervous System Lymphoma is a rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain, spine, or eyes. It is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.\n\nOther possible diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results. Toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is associated with a distinct pattern of demyelination on MRI.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this infant, born to an HIV-positive mother, is to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. The specific regimen and duration may vary depending on current guidelines and the mother's antiretroviral therapy regimen, but typically, it involves administering zidovudine (AZT) to the newborn.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations, for infants born to mothers with HIV, the recommended prophylaxis is:\n\n1. **Zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy** for 4-6 weeks, starting as soon as possible after birth, preferably within the first 6-12 hours of life. The dose is typically 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours.\n\nAdditionally, consideration should be given to:\n\n- **HIV PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing** at birth (or as soon as possible), 2 weeks, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age to assess for HIV infection in the infant. If any of these tests are positive, the infant should be referred to a pediatric HIV specialist for further management.\n- **Continuation of antiretroviral prophylaxis** based on the HIV exposure and the mother's viral load. For a mother with a viral load >1000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, some guidelines recommend combination antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant, but the specifics can depend on various factors including the mother's regimen and resistance testing if available.\n- **Support and follow-up** with a pediatric HIV specialist to monitor for signs of HIV infection, manage any potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy, and to ensure adherence to the recommended prophylactic regimen.\n- **Safe feeding practices**, such as formula feeding, if the mother is not planning to exclusively formula feed, due to the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV through breast milk.\n\nIt's also crucial to ensure that the mother receives appropriate postpartum care, including management of her HIV infection, to prevent further transmission and to maintain her health.\n\nGiven the specifics of this case, where the mother's viral load is 678 copies/mL, which is below 1000 copies/mL, the initial approach would typically involve zidovudine monotherapy for the infant, along with the aforementioned monitoring and follow-up. However, the exact approach may be tailored based on current guidelines, the specifics of the mother's antiretroviral regimen, and consultation with pediatric HIV specialists.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
