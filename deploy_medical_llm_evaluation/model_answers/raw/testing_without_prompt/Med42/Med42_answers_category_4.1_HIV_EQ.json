    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "1  (Single best answer)\n\nCorticosteroids\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's presentation and lumbar puncture findings are highly suggestive of Cryptococcal Meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The initiated treatment with IV amphoteric B and oral flucytosine is appropriate for Cryptococcal Meningitis. However, in this acute setting, especially given the elevated opening pressure (285 mm H2O), additional treatment with corticosteroids (typically dexamethasone) may be warranted to manage increased intracranial pressure and prevent complications such as cerebral herniation. This is supported by guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and other reputable sources. Corticosteroids can help reduce cerebral edema and alleviate symptoms related to increased pressure, though their use should be balanced against potential immunosuppressive effects in an already immunocompromised patient.\n\nOther options are not directly relevant in this acute setting:\n- Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for long-term management of HIV/AIDS, but its initiation or adjustment is not the immediate concern in this ED presentation focused on treating Cryptococcal Meningitis.\n- Blood cultures are useful for diagnosing bacteremia but are not directly related to the patient's current presentation of meningitis.\n- A CT scan of the head may be useful for ruling out other causes of increased intracranial pressure or complications, but it does not represent an additional treatment.\n- IV fluids and electrolyte management are supportive care measures but not specific treatments for Cryptococcal Meningitis or its complications.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "1  (To answer, first calculate sensitivity and specificity, then proceed to NPV)\n\nStep 1: Calculate Sensitivity\nSensitivity represents the proportion of true positives (TP) among all actual disease-positive cases (in this context, confirmed AIDS patients). Here, we have 240 true positives (AIDS patients testing positive on the novel screening) out of 250 total AIDS patients enrolled.\n\nSensitivity = (True Positives) / (Total Disease-Positive Cases)\nSensitivity = 240 / 250 \u2248 0.96 (or 96%)\n\nStep 2: Calculate Specificity\nSpecificity represents the proportion of true negatives (TN) among all actual disease-negative cases (in this context, patients without AIDS). Here, we have 245 true negatives (non-AIDS patients testing negative on the novel screening) out of 250 total non-AIDS patients enrolled.\n\nSpecificity = (True Negatives) / (Total Disease-Negative Cases)\nSpecificity = 245 / 250 \u2248 0.98 (or 98%)\n\nStep 3: Calculate Negative Predictive Value (NPV)\nNPV represents the proportion of true negatives among all test-negative results. In this case, we have 245 true negatives (non-AIDS patients testing negative) and 10 false negatives (AIDS patients testing negative, which is 250 - 240 = 10).\n\nNPV = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.961 (or 96.1%)\n\nSo, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this novel AIDS screening test is approximately 96.1%, indicating that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96.1% probability that they do not have AIDS.  1  (Note: The exact values may vary slightly due to rounding, but the approximation provided is accurate for practical purposes.)  1  (1 - Reference: Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences, 10th Edition, by Wayne W.

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "1. Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n  2. Blood Type and Antibody Screen (including Rh status)\n  3. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)\n  4. Rubella IgG Antibody\n  5. Urinalysis\n  6. Varicella IgG Antibody\n  7. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\n  8. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Screening (CFCS)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on current prenatal care guidelines and recommendations.\n\n1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): **Yes**, a CBC is recommended at the initial prenatal visit to assess for anemia and other hematologic abnormalities. (Source: ACOG Practice Bulletin 197, 2018)\n\n2. Blood Type and Antibody Screen (including Rh status): **Yes**, this is essential for identifying potential blood type incompatibilities and risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. (Source: ACOG Committee Opinion 752, 2018)\n\n3. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg): **Yes**, screening for HBsAg is universally recommended for all pregnant women at the initial prenatal visit to prevent perinatal transmission. (Source: CDC Guidelines, 2020)\n\n4. Rubella IgG Antibody: **Yes**, rubella immunity should be confirmed to prevent congenital rubella syndrome. If nonimmune, vaccination postpartum is recommended. (Source: ACOG Practice Bulletin 200, 2018)\n\n5. Urinalysis: **Yes**, urinalysis is recommended to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to complications if untreated. (Source: USPSTF Recommendation, 2019)\n\n6. Varicella IgG Antibody: **Yes**, varicella immunity should be confirmed to prevent maternal infection and subsequent congenital varicella syndrome. If nonimmune, vaccination postpartum is recommended. (Source: ACOG Practice Bulletin 200, 2018)\n\n7. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): **No**, routine TSH screening is not recommended for asymptomatic women without risk factors (e.g., personal or family history of thyroid disease). (Source: ACOG Practice Bulletin 148, 2015)\n\n8. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Screening (CFCS): **No**, CFCS is not universally recommended for all pregnant women. It should be offered to those with a family history or other risk factors. (Source: ACOG Committee Opinion 691, 2017)\n\nIn summary, at this initial prenatal visit, the following tests should be performed: CBC, Blood Type and Antibody Screen, HBsAg, Rubella IgG Antibody, Urinalysis, and Varicella IgG Antibody. TSH and CFCS are not indicated based on current guidelines.",

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, given the patient's severely low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and prolonged interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the primary concern is preventing and managing opportunistic infections. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis**: With a CD4+ count below 100 cells/mm3, PCP prophylaxis is essential. The recommended medication is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a dose of 1 double-strength tablet daily or 3 times a week. This will help prevent PCP, a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n2. **Toxoplasma gondii Prophylaxis**: Although not universally recommended for all patients with CD4+ < 100 cells/mm3, given this patient's extremely low count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence, adding toxoplasmosis prophylaxis may be considered. TMP-SMX, already prescribed for PCP prophylaxis, also provides protection against toxoplasmosis. However, if the patient has a sulfa allergy or intolerance, alternative regimens such as dapsone plus pyrimethamine or atovaquone can be used.\n\n3. **Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) Prophylaxis**: For patients with CD4+ counts < 50 cells/mm3, MAC prophylaxis is recommended. Azithromycin 1200 mg once weekly or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily are effective options. However, given the patient's recent resumption of ART, some guidelines suggest deferring MAC prophylaxis until the CD4+ count remains below 50 cells/mm3 for at least 3 months after ART initiation.\n\n4. **Candidiasis Prophylaxis**: While not universally recommended, some experts suggest fluconazole prophylaxis for patients with CD4+ counts < 50 cells/mm3, especially if they have a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis. However, this is not a standard recommendation for all patients in this category.\n\n5. **Depression Management**: It's crucial to address the patient's underlying depression, which led to non-adherence. Referral to a mental health professional and initiation of antidepressant therapy, if not already done, should be prioritized.\n\n6. **Close Monitoring**: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of opportunistic infections and ART side effects. Regular follow-up appointments, ideally every 1-2 months, will help ensure adherence to both ART and prophylactic medications.\n\nIn summary, the patient should take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis, and consider azithromycin or clarithromycin for MAC prophylaxis if his CD4+ count remains below 50 cells/mm3 after 3 months of ART. Addressing depression and ensuring close monitoring are equally important aspects of his care.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "\u0336  Please provide a specific regimen and duration.\n\nThe patient's presentation is suggestive of disseminated Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella species, commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals like those with advanced HIV/AIDS. Given her CD4+ count of 98/mm3, indicating severe immunosuppression, and biopsy results confirming BA, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is:\n\n1. Erythromycin: This macrolide antibiotic is the first-line treatment for Bacillary Angiomatosis. The recommended regimen is oral erythromycin 500 mg four times daily for at least 3 months to ensure complete resolution of lesions and prevent relapse (CDC, 2015; Koehler & Relman, 2014).\n\n2. Concurrently, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized if not already done, to improve her immune status and prevent further opportunistic infections. The specific ART regimen will depend on her prior treatment history, potential drug interactions, and resistance testing results, but a standard combination would include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).\n\n3. Supportive care, including nutritional support, management of nausea and abdominal pain, and smoking cessation counseling, should also be provided.\n\n4. Given her history of intravenous drug use, screening for other infections such as hepatitis C and syphilis should be performed, and appropriate treatment initiated if necessary.\n\nReferences:\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Given the medications prescribed (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Lipodystrophy syndrome**: This is a common side effect of long-term use of protease inhibitors like indinavir. It involves changes in body fat distribution, such as increased fat in the abdomen, back of the neck (buffalo hump), and breasts, along with wasting of fat in the face, arms, and legs.\n2. **Metabolic disturbances**: Both protease inhibitors (indinavir) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, such as lamivudine and zidovudine) can contribute to metabolic changes, including hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n3. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Indinavir is known to increase the risk of kidney stone formation due to its low solubility and crystallization in urine.\n4. **Hepatotoxicity**: Both NRTIs and protease inhibitors can cause liver enzyme elevations and, in rare cases, more severe liver damage. This risk is higher in patients with pre-existing liver disease or coinfection with hepatitis viruses.\n5. **Anemia and neutropenia**: Zidovudine, an NRTI, can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia and neutropenia, particularly at high doses or with prolonged use.\n6. **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Indinavir can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, while zidovudine may lead to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n7. **Peripheral neuropathy**: Both lamivudine and zidovudine have been associated with peripheral neuropathy, although this is less common with lamivudine.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient closely for these potential adverse effects and adjust the treatment regimen as needed to minimize side effects while maintaining effective viral suppression.",

He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder\n2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n3. Toxoplasmosis\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\nAnswer: 2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's recent inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy followed by re-establishment of treatment compliance, along with his immunosuppressed state (CD4+ count 90/\u03bcL), sets the stage for an opportunistic infection or malignancy. The MRI findings of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, along with the positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, strongly suggest primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is an AIDS-defining condition, and EBV is known to drive lymphomagenesis in this context. The patient's symptoms of headache, vertigo, and personality changes, along with neurological findings of ataxia and apathy, are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain. The Mini-Mental State Examination score of 15/30 indicates significant cognitive impairment. While HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder could contribute to cognitive decline, it would not explain the focal lesion on MRI. Toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal meningitis are less likely given the solitary lesion and lack of other supporting laboratory findings (e.g., toxoplasma serology or cryptococcal antigen). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy typically presents with multifocal lesions, not a solitary mass.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "1  - Administer intramuscular (IM) zidovudine (ZDV) to the newborn\n2  - Initiate oral zidovudine (ZDV) for 4-6 weeks\n3  - Administer both IM and oral zidovudine (ZDV) to the newborn\n4  - No antiretroviral prophylaxis for the newborn\n5  - Breastfeeding initiation (assuming no other contraindications)\n\nAnswer: 2 - Initiate oral zidovudine (ZDV) for 4-6 weeks\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the mother has HIV with a controlled viral load (678 copies/mL) due to adherence to triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. The infant's risk for vertical transmission (mother-to-child) is reduced but not eliminated. Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend antiretroviral prophylaxis for the newborn in this situation.\n\nThe most appropriate choice is to initiate oral zidovudine (ZDV) for 4-6 weeks, as this provides prophylaxis against vertical transmission without exposing the infant to the potential pain and trauma of intramuscular injections. The combination of IM and oral ZDV is not necessary, and withholding prophylaxis is not recommended given the ongoing risk of transmission despite maternal therapy. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-positive mothers in the United States, as it increases the risk of transmission, so option 5 is not appropriate.  1  - CDC. (2021).
