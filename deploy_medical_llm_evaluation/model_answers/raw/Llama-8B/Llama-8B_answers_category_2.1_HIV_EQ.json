    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC virus (JCV) reactivation.\n\nThe presence of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, along with lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis and positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, might seem contradictory, but EBV is not the causative agent in this case. However, EBV is a herpesvirus and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV patients, even in the absence of active EBV infection.\n\nThe key factors supporting a diagnosis of PML include the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL), which increases the risk of opportunistic infections, and the presence of a JC virus (JCV) in the cerebrospinal fluid. PML is a rare but serious condition caused by JCV reactivation in immunocompromised patients, typically those with advanced HIV disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (also known as T-20). It's a fusion inhibitor that works by binding to the gp41 subunit, preventing the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane, thereby inhibiting viral entry.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the presentation and test results, the patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts.\n\nThe most appropriate drug for managing MAC infection is Clarithromycin, an antibiotic belonging to the macrolide class.\n\nThe mechanism of action of Clarithromycin involves binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to bacterial cell death. Specifically, it binds to the site where the aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the ribosome, preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain. This action is bacteriostatic, meaning it inhibits the growth and replication of bacteria, but does not kill them directly. However, in the context of MAC infection, the combination of Clarithromycin with other antibiotics such as ethambutol and azithromycin (or rifabutin) is typically used to achieve bactericidal effects and improve treatment outcomes.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response include gp41, gp120, and gp160. However, the most likely target of the antibody the physician scientist is designing would be gp120. \n\nThis is because gp120 is a key component of the HIV envelope that interacts with the host cell CD4 receptor, facilitating viral entry into the cell. It is a major antigenic target for the immune system, and antibodies against gp120 have been shown to neutralize the virus by blocking this interaction.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely causal organism is Aspergillus species. The septate hyphae that branch at acute angles are characteristic of Aspergillus. Aspergillus is a common opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV, and can cause pulmonary aspergillosis, which may present with symptoms like fever and hemoptysis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to the patient's current regimen puts him at greatest risk for nephrotoxicity. Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir, which is known to cause nephrotoxicity, especially when used in combination with other nephrotoxic agents, such as tenofovir (not mentioned in this case, but a common NRTI used in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine). The combination of valganciclovir and tenofovir increases the risk of renal impairment.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate diagnostic test for HIV in the newborn would be the HIV DNA/ RNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test. This test can detect the presence of HIV RNA in the baby's blood, which indicates active infection. It's typically performed at 14-24 hours and 1-2 weeks of age, and it's considered the gold standard for diagnosing HIV in newborns.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "The physician should inform the patient that maintaining confidentiality is a fundamental aspect of the doctor-patient relationship. However, they also have a duty to protect the patient's wife, who is also their patient, from potential harm. \n\nThe most appropriate next step is to inform the patient that, due to the risk of transmission to his wife, it is mandatory to disclose the diagnosis to her. This is because HIV is a reportable disease, and failure to disclose can lead to legal consequences. The physician should explain this to the patient and encourage him to disclose the information to his wife. If the patient still refuses, the physician should consider involving public health authorities or reporting the case to the state health department, which may lead to mandatory disclosure.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the abdominal pain radiating to the back and nausea/vomiting, are classic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. The contrast CT of the abdomen further supports this diagnosis by showing an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection.\n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV infection, it's essential to consider potential opportunistic infections or medications as contributing factors to acute pancreatitis. However, the patient's HIV medications are unknown, and without more information, it's difficult to determine if any of these might be contributing to the pancreatitis.\n\nIn the context of this patient's history, it's also essential to consider the potential role of alcohol use in the development of acute pancreatitis. The patient reports moderate social alcohol use, which may be a contributing factor.\n\nA thorough investigation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and further laboratory tests, is necessary to determine the exact etiology of this patient's condition.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine, also known as AZT, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme essential for the replication of retroviruses like HIV.\n\nThe biological process most likely disrupted by zidovudine's action is the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. Reverse transcription is a crucial step in the HIV life cycle, where the viral RNA genome is converted into DNA, allowing the virus to integrate into the host's genome and replicate. By inhibiting this process, zidovudine reduces the viral load, thereby decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during childbirth.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "Research has shown that DNA methylation profiles can differ between individuals with latent HIV-1 infection and those with active HIV-1 infection. \n\nIn latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation patterns are often characterized by increased methylation of certain gene promoters, particularly those involved in immune response and inflammation, which may contribute to the virus's ability to remain dormant. This is often seen in cells like resting CD4+ T cells.\n\nIn contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with decreased methylation of certain gene promoters and increased methylation of others, which may indicate ongoing viral replication and immune activation. These changes can be seen in various cell types, including activated CD4+ T cells.\n\nStudies have also identified specific DNA methylation signatures that can distinguish between latent and active HIV-1 infection, which may have implications for developing biomarkers for monitoring HIV-1 status and potentially for identifying individuals at risk of reactivation.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
