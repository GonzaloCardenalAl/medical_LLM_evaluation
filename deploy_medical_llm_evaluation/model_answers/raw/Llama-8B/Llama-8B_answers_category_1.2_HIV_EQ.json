    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is typically diagnosed through a combination of tests that detect the presence of the virus or the body's immune response to it. The standard steps for diagnosing HIV include:\n\n1. **Rapid tests**: These are point-of-care tests that provide immediate results, usually within 20-30 minutes. They detect antibodies or antigens (substances produced by the virus) in a blood sample.\n2. **Serum tests**: These are laboratory tests that detect antibodies or antigens in a blood sample. They are more sensitive and specific than rapid tests.\n3. **Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**: These tests detect the genetic material of the virus (RNA or DNA) in a blood sample. They are highly sensitive and specific.\n4. **Fourth-generation tests**: These tests combine antibodies and antigens to detect both early infection (p24 antigen) and later infection (antibodies).\n\nA diagnosis of HIV is confirmed when two or more tests are positive.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV infection progresses through several stages. The main stages are:\n\n1. **Acute HIV infection**: This is the initial stage, usually occurring within 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus. During this period, the virus replicates rapidly, and the individual may experience flu-like symptoms.\n\n2. **Clinical latency (also known as chronic HIV infection)**: This stage can last for many years, even decades, without symptoms. The virus continues to replicate, but at a slower rate. During this time, the individual can still transmit the virus to others.\n\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: This is the final stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged, and the individual becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer. This stage typically occurs when the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells per microliter.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the concept of \"stages\" is somewhat outdated. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have adopted a more nuanced approach, using the following categories to describe the progression of HIV infection:\n\n- **Acute HIV infection**\n- **Clinical latency (or chronic HIV infection)**\n- **AIDS diagnosis (defined by a CD4 count below 200 cells/\u03bcL or the presence of certain opportunistic infections or cancers)**\n- **AIDS-related illnesses**\n\nIt's essential to note that with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the progression from HIV infection to AIDS can be significantly delayed or even prevented.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at an increased risk of various comorbidities due to the disease itself, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and other factors. Common comorbidities include:\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke.\n2.  **Liver disease**: Liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n3.  **Kidney disease**: Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.\n4.  **Neurological disorders**: Neurocognitive disorders, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures.\n5.  **Mental health conditions**: Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.\n6.  **Osteoporosis**: Weakened bones due to low bone density.\n7.  **Osteonecrosis**: Avascular necrosis of the bone, often in the hip or knee.\n8.  **Cancer**: Increased risk of certain cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer.\n9.  **Malnutrition**: Malabsorption and malnutrition due to gastrointestinal issues or ART side effects.\n10. **Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)**: Inflammatory reactions when the immune system recovers from HIV.\n\nThese comorbidities can be managed with proper medical care, adherence to ART, and regular health check-ups.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several methods:\n\n1. **Abstinence**: Avoiding any sexual activity or sharing needles can prevent HIV transmission.\n2. **Condoms**: Using latex or polyurethane condoms consistently and correctly during sex can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.\n3. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medication daily can prevent HIV infection in people who are at high risk.\n4. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medication within 72 hours after potential exposure can prevent HIV infection.\n5. **HIV testing and treatment**: Knowing your HIV status and getting treatment if infected can prevent transmission to others.\n6. **HIV vaccination**: There is currently no licensed HIV vaccine available, but several candidates are in development.\n7. **Needle exchange programs**: Replacing used needles with new ones can prevent HIV transmission through needle sharing.\n8. **Blood screening**: Screening blood donations can detect HIV and prevent transmission through blood transfusions.\n\nIt's essential to note that no single method is 100% effective, and using a combination of these methods can provide the best protection against HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "For most people living with HIV, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is taken once daily. The specific regimen and dosing schedule may vary depending on the individual's health status, the type of medications prescribed, and any potential interactions with other medications. However, once-daily dosing is the standard for most modern ART regimens. It's essential to follow the prescribed treatment plan as directed by your healthcare provider.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

  {
    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Preventing perinatal transmission of HIV involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the mother**: Effective ART reduces the viral load in the mother's blood, significantly lowering the risk of transmission to the baby.\n2. **Pregnancy planning and testing**: Identifying HIV-positive women early in pregnancy allows for timely ART initiation and planning for a safe delivery.\n3. **Elective cesarean delivery**: Delivering by cesarean section can reduce the risk of transmission, especially if the mother's viral load is high.\n4. **Breastfeeding alternatives**: HIV-positive mothers should not breastfeed their babies, as the virus can be transmitted through breast milk.\n5. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Administering PEP to the baby within 72 hours of birth can prevent HIV transmission if the mother's status is unknown or if there was an exposure during delivery.\n6. **HIV testing for the baby**: Testing the baby for HIV at birth, 1-2 months, and 4-6 weeks of age can identify any potential transmission early.\n\nThese measures can significantly reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) are related but distinct conditions.\n\nHIV is a viral infection that attacks the body's immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which help fight infections. If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS.\n\nAIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged, making the person more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer. In other words, AIDS is a condition that occurs when HIV has significantly weakened the immune system.\n\nThink of it like a tree: HIV is the infection that damages the tree (immune system), and AIDS is the point at which the tree is severely weakened and more prone to disease.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is not transmitted through:\n\n1. **Casual contact**: Hugging, kissing, shaking hands, or sharing food and drinks with someone who has HIV.\n2. **Insect bites**: Mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects cannot transmit HIV.\n3. **Air or water**: HIV is not airborne and cannot be spread through water, air, or swimming pools.\n4. **Casual sharing of personal items**: Sharing towels, utensils, or other personal items with someone who has HIV is not a risk.\n\nHowever, HIV can be transmitted through:\n\n1. **Unprotected sex**: Unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has HIV.\n2. **Sharing needles or syringes**: Sharing needles or syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood.\n3. **Mother-to-child transmission**: From an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n4. **Blood transfusions**: Receiving HIV-infected blood through a blood transfusion (this is extremely rare in countries with strict blood screening).\n\nIt's essential to note that HIV can also be transmitted through **occupational exposure** in healthcare settings, such as needlesticks or mucous membrane exposure, if proper precautions are not taken.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent HIV and active infection is a complex process. \n\nLatent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates into the host's DNA and remains dormant. This is often due to a balance between the virus and the host's immune system. The virus can reactivate when the host's immune system is weakened, such as during immunosuppression or stress.\n\nThe reactivation of latent HIV is thought to occur through a process called \"lysis\" where the virus reactivates from its latent state. However, the exact mechanisms behind this process are not fully understood.\n\nResearch suggests that certain factors can trigger reactivation, including:\n\n1.  CD4+ T cell activation: When the body's immune system is activated, it can lead to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n2.  Inflammation: Chronic inflammation can lead to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n3.  Immunosuppression: Weakened immune systems, such as those caused by HIV itself or other conditions like cancer or organ transplantation, can lead to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n4.  Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during pregnancy or menopause, can also contribute to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n\nIt's worth noting that the reactivation of latent HIV is a rare event, and the majority of people living with HIV remain in a latent state.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
