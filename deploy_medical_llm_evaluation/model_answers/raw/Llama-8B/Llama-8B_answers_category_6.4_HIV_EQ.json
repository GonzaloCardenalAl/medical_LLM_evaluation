    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, antiretroviral therapy for HIV was still in its early stages. I do not have exact data on the most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland for that year. However, some of the first antiretroviral drugs approved were AZT (zidovudine), ddI (didanosine), ddC (zalcitabine), and saquinavir was not yet available, but some others like zalcitabine and didanosine were used.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "Unfortunately, I couldn't find the exact information on the most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland in 2010. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the commonly used antiretroviral drugs around that time.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the most commonly used antiretroviral drug classes were:\n\n1.  Tenofovir (NRTI)\n2.  Lamivudine (NRTI)\n3.  Efavirenz (NNRTI)\n4.  Lopinavir (PI)\n5.  Ritonavir (PI, used as a booster)\n\nPlease note that the specific combination and usage may have varied depending on the treatment guidelines and patient-specific factors. For more accurate information, I recommend checking the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) or other reliable sources for data from 2010.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "I couldn't find any specific data on the birth rate in Switzerland in 2010 comparing women with and without HIV. However, I can provide some general information. \n\nIn general, HIV status does not directly affect a woman's ability to become pregnant. However, HIV-positive women with advanced disease or very low CD4 counts might face challenges with fertility due to the effects of the virus on the reproductive system. \n\nIf you're looking for specific data, I recommend checking the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or other reliable sources for more accurate information on birth rates in Switzerland in 2010.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "I couldn't find any specific data on the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV for 2020. However, according to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, the general fertility rate in Switzerland in 2020 was 1.47 children per woman. \n\nIn the context of HIV, research suggests that women with HIV may face various reproductive health challenges, such as higher rates of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight. However, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved maternal and infant health outcomes for women living with HIV.\n\nTo find a more specific answer to your question, I would recommend consulting the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or other reputable sources that focus on reproductive health and HIV statistics in Switzerland.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "answer": "I'm not aware of the specific data for Switzerland regarding the proportion of people with HIV (PWH) who died from HIV-related causes and had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20. However, I can suggest some possible sources where you may be able to find this information.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) might have published data on this topic. The SHCS is a well-established cohort study that has been tracking HIV-positive individuals in Switzerland since 1988.\n\nIf you're looking for the most up-to-date and accurate information, I recommend checking the official websites of the FOPH or the SHCS, or searching for peer-reviewed articles published in reputable scientific journals.",

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "Research suggests that age at HIV diagnosis can impact the rate of CD4 decline. A study published in the 'AIDS' journal found that in individuals diagnosed with HIV between 1996 and 2006, those diagnosed before the age of 20 had a slower rate of CD4 decline compared to those diagnosed at an older age. \n\nHowever, I couldn't find specific data for individuals in Switzerland diagnosed between 1990 and 2010. More research is needed to confirm the exact impact of age at diagnosis on CD4 decline in this specific population.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
