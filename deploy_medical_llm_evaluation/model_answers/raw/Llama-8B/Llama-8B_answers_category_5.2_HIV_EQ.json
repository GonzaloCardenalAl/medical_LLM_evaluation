    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, the patient's current condition is most likely due to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated neurodegeneration, which is characterized by demyelination and atypical astrocytes. \n\nThe patient's low CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L, despite inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, suggests that the virus is not well-controlled. This, combined with the symptoms of cognitive impairment, motor weakness, and coordination issues, strongly points towards HAND.\n\nThe presence of numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions on MRI without mass effect is also consistent with HIV-associated neurodegeneration. The brain biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes further support this diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy has likely contributed to the progression of the disease. Restarting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy, along with managing the patient's symptoms, should be the next steps in her treatment plan.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's current treatment regimen with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, he is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1.  **Pancreatitis**: As you mentioned, indinavir is known to cause pancreatitis as an adverse effect. This is a significant concern since he was recently prescribed a treatment that had this adverse effect. Monitoring for pancreatitis symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, is crucial.\n\n2.  **Diarrhea**: Zidovudine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea.\n\n3.  **Nephrotoxicity**: Zidovudine can also cause renal impairment and increase the risk of kidney stones.\n\n4.  **Hematologic abnormalities**: Zidovudine can cause anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n5.  **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can cause indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to its effect on the CYP3A4 enzyme.\n\n6.  **Hepatotoxicity**: All three medications can cause liver enzyme elevations, but this is more common with indinavir.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient closely for these potential adverse effects and adjust the treatment regimen if necessary.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Mycobacterium avium. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely causal organism is Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as chills, skin lesions, and hepatomegaly, are consistent with disseminated MAC infection, which is common in individuals with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count < 50 cells/\u03bcL, but in this case, 180 cells/\u03bcL, although still low, might not be enough to rule out disseminated MAC). The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils are also consistent with MAC infection.\n\nThe fact that the patient was recently exposed to someone with similar symptoms increases the likelihood of MAC infection. The negative rapid plasma reagin test makes syphilis less likely, and the patient's history of not taking antiretroviral therapy for over 5 years likely contributed to his immunocompromised state.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that a definitive diagnosis of MAC requires culture or PCR confirmation.",

While pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is a condition that can cause symptoms like coughing and difficulty swallowing, it is not typically associated with the patient's current presentation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count (280/mm3) may have contributed to his increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections, including pneumonia. However, the exact cause of the pneumonia is not specified in this scenario, and further testing (e.g. sputum culture, blood cultures) would be necessary to determine the specific pathogen responsible.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation with sudden weakness of his right hand, low CD4 count, and fever, it's essential to consider opportunistic infections, particularly in the context of HIV. \n\nBefore starting any new treatment, it's crucial to rule out potential causes of his weakness. The first step would be to obtain a comprehensive laboratory workup, including:\n\n1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia, infection, or other hematological abnormalities.\n2. Blood cultures to identify any potential bacterial infections.\n3. Lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out central nervous system infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, which is more common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts.\n4. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan, to evaluate for any structural abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord.\n5. Blood chemistry tests to assess for electrolyte imbalances and potential medication toxicities.\n\nIt's also essential to review his medication adherence and consider potential interactions or side effects of his current medications.\n\nGiven the patient's history of inconsistent adherence, it's crucial to assess his current viral load and CD4 count to determine the effectiveness of his antiretroviral therapy (ART). \n\nThe use of empiric itraconazole for the past 10 years is concerning, as it may not be the best choice for empirical antifungal coverage in this patient. \n\nIn the meantime, while waiting for the laboratory results, the patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral coverage to cover for potential opportunistic infections.\n\nHowever, the next best step would be to consult with an Infectious Disease specialist for further guidance on the management of this patient, given the complexity of his case.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks' gestation, it's essential to perform routine screening tests for various infections that can impact pregnancy. Given her history and the hospital's testing protocols, the following tests should be considered:\n\n1. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: Determine her blood type and Rh factor to guide any future blood transfusions and to identify any potential risks for Rh incompatibility.\n2. **Screening for Hepatitis B and C**: Although she's had vaccinations, it's crucial to check for Hepatitis B and C, especially if she's not aware of her vaccination status.\n3. **Screening for Syphilis**: Although she tested negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it's essential to test for syphilis, as it's a separate infection.\n4. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening**: This is typically done between 35-37 weeks of gestation, but it's a good practice to test for GBS colonization early in pregnancy to plan for potential treatment later on.\n5. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG**: Although her CMV serology from 4 years ago is likely still valid, rechecking CMV IgG can provide reassurance that she's immune to CMV.\n6. **Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free beta-hCG**: These are part of the first-trimester screening for aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities).\n\nIt's also essential to discuss and provide information on:\n\n- **HIV Testing**: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, HIV testing should be repeated in pregnancy, ideally at the first prenatal visit and again at 28 weeks.\n- **Influenza and Tdap Vaccination**: Administer the flu and Tdap vaccines according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\n- **Folic Acid Supplementation**: Recommend folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects.\n- **Counseling on Substance Use and Smoking**: Discuss the risks associated with substance use and smoking during pregnancy.\n- **Family Planning and Contraception**: Discuss family planning and contraception options with her and her husband.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, including fever, skin lesions, and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 98/mm3, it is likely that she has an opportunistic infection. The presence of white patches on her palate that can be scraped off suggests oral thrush (candidiasis), which is common in immunocompromised patients. The skin lesions and fever, along with a history of IV drug use, raise concern for bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain support this diagnosis.\n\nGiven that your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, and considering the patient's presentation, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to discontinue Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine due to the high risk of resistance and toxicity. Instead, the recommended treatment for bacillary angiomatosis is Erythromycin 500 mg PO 4 times daily for 4-6 weeks, or Azithromycin 500-1000 mg PO once daily for 4-6 weeks. \n\nIt's essential to note that the patient should also receive treatment for her HIV, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), to improve her immune status and prevent further opportunistic infections. Additionally, addressing her substance use disorder with a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatry and social work, is crucial for her overall care.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation is suggestive of condylomata lata, which are flat, painless, skin-colored lesions often seen in individuals with untreated or undertreated HIV infection. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causing the lesions to turn white is consistent with this diagnosis, as the lesions will typically turn white due to aceto-whitening.\n\nThe lesions are associated with secondary syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum. The presence of multiple sexual partners and the patient's HIV status increase the likelihood of syphilis. The lesions are a manifestation of the secondary stage of syphilis, which can occur months to years after the initial infection.\n\nHPV (types 16 & 18) is associated with different lesions, such as genital warts. The hospital's past attribution to HPV was incorrect in this case.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient initially presented with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and was started on a standard 4-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). He showed improvement, but after pyrazinamide was stopped and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated, he developed a new set of symptoms, including fever, increased cough, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nGiven the new symptoms and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the most likely diagnosis is paradoxical reaction or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) due to TB, which is a known complication of starting ART in patients with latent or active TB.\n\nThe initial step in treatment should be to restart the original 4-drug antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) and add corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to manage the inflammatory response. The addition of streptomycin, which has been part of the hospital's protocol for the past 10 years, may not be necessary in this case, as the patient was initially on the standard 4-drug regimen and showed improvement before ART was started.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and history, I would like to clarify that attributing the origin of his condition solely to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) for the past 10 years without considering other potential causes might not be accurate. MPGN is a type of glomerulonephritis, but it's essential to consider other possible etiologies, especially given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, proteinuria, and edema, and his history of HIV, I would suggest considering HIV-associated nephropathy, specifically HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome, as a more likely etiology. This condition is more common in African Americans with poorly controlled HIV and is characterized by rapid progression to kidney failure.\n\nIt's also essential to note that the patient's history of heroin addiction might be a contributing factor to his kidney disease, as heroin use can cause direct kidney damage. However, in this case, it's more likely that his HIV status is the primary contributing factor.\n\nA kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, such as MPGN.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation is suggestive of endocarditis, likely due to his HIV status and history of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray and the new-onset heart murmur are concerning for endocarditis. \n\nHowever, the Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is not a reliable test for diagnosing endocarditis. The ASO titer is used to diagnose acute rheumatic fever, not endocarditis. \n\nA more reliable test for diagnosing endocarditis, particularly in an immunocompromised patient like this one, is the blood culture. Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing endocarditis, as they can detect the causative microorganism. I would recommend ordering blood cultures to guide antibiotic therapy.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, the most likely diagnosis is Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), a complication of chemotherapy-induced cell death in patients with cancer, particularly those with Burkitt's lymphoma. TLS is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury.\n\nThe patient's elevated creatinine, BUN, serum uric acid, and potassium levels are consistent with TLS. However, the use of Allopurinol for the past 10 years is not relevant to this acute presentation, as Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to prevent tumor lysis syndrome in patients with cancer, but its effectiveness is questionable in this scenario.\n\nThe most appropriate therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities would be:\n\n1. Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to correct electrolyte imbalances and manage acute kidney injury.\n2. Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) 0.2 mg/kg/day to reduce serum uric acid levels.\n3. Potassium-lowering medications such as insulin and glucose, or potassium-binding resins to manage hyperkalemia.\n4. Calcium and phosphate supplements to manage hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's long-term use of Allopurinol may not be effective in preventing TLS in this acute setting, and more aggressive interventions are necessary to manage the patient's condition.",
