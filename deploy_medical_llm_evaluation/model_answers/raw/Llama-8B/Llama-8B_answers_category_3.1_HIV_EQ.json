    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the MRI findings, the most likely cause of her condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nPML is a rare and serious viral infection caused by the JC virus, which affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV. The patient's low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L) and history of skipping antiretroviral therapy are consistent with immunosuppression. The MRI findings of non-enhancing, hyperintense lesions without mass effect are typical of PML, and the brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes supports this diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of acute weakness in one limb, fever, and recent history of inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART), I would recommend ordering an HIV viral load and a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for potential immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or opportunistic infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis, which can cause neurological symptoms in patients with HIV.\n\nAdditionally, given the patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis, it would be essential to rule out other potential causes of neurological weakness, such as a vascular event (e.g., transient ischemic attack or stroke), and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (e.g., Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome).\n\nHowever, given the patient's recent hospitalization for pneumonia and inconsistent ART adherence, I would prioritize assessing for opportunistic infections that can cause neurological symptoms. \n\nThe next best step in management would be to order the following:\n\n1. HIV viral load\n2. CBC with differential\n3. Lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to evaluate for cryptococcal antigen, toxoplasmosis, and other opportunistic infections\n4. Neuroimaging studies, such as a non-contrast head CT or MRI, to evaluate for structural abnormalities or vascular events.\n\nThese tests will help guide further management and determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At this visit, I would recommend the following tests:\n\n1. **Rapid HIV test**: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, HIV testing is recommended at the beginning of pregnancy due to the risk of undiagnosed HIV infection between tests. A rapid HIV test will provide a result within 20-30 minutes.\n2. **Urinalysis**: To check for any potential urinary tract infections or other abnormalities.\n3. **Blood work**: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine, and Liver Function Tests (LFTs) to assess her overall health and detect any potential issues early.\n4. **Blood Type and Rh factor**: To determine her blood type and Rh factor, which is essential for future blood transfusions and to guide any potential blood transfusions during delivery.\n5. **Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening**: Although not universally required, it's recommended for all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation. However, some institutions may perform it earlier. \n6. **Pap smear and HPV testing**: Not immediately necessary, but recommended for cervical cancer screening in the future.\n7. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test**: To check for hepatitis B infection.\n8. **Syphilis screening**: Recommended for all pregnant women to detect syphilis infection.\n9. **Pregnancy-specific ultrasounds**: To confirm the pregnancy and fetal viability.\n10. **Counseling on HIV, STIs, and other pregnancy-related topics**: Essential for informed decision-making and education.\n\nThese tests will help identify any potential health issues early in pregnancy, allowing for prompt intervention and management if necessary.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, I would suspect a diagnosis of Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a complication of HIV infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, often seen in immunocompromised individuals with a history of intravenous drug use. \n\nThe presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain from the skin biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosa is doxycycline 100mg orally twice daily for 6-8 weeks. However, in this patient's case, given her low CD4 count and history of intravenous drug use, a more comprehensive treatment approach should be considered.\n\nI would recommend starting doxycycline 100mg orally twice daily, and also adding rifampicin 600mg orally daily for 6-8 weeks to cover for possible co-infection with other pathogens. Additionally, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized to increase her CD4 count and improve her immune function.\n\nIt's essential to note that ART should be tailored to the patient's specific HIV genotype and resistance profile. A consultation with an HIV specialist would be beneficial to determine the most suitable ART regimen for this patient.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the physical examination findings, I would suspect condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts. The characteristic appearance of the lesions, which are painless, skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform, is consistent with this diagnosis. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causing the lesions to turn white (acetowhitening) is a diagnostic clue for condyloma acuminata, as this reaction is a result of the acid highlighting the lesions.\n\nGenital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically low-risk types such as HPV-6 and HPV-11. This patient's history of multiple sexual partners increases his risk for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), also known as paradoxical reaction, occurring due to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. \n\nThe initial step is to continue both TB treatment and ART. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a known complication of starting ART in patients with TB. It is characterized by an exacerbation of symptoms, often accompanied by worsening radiographic findings, but not necessarily a worsening of the TB smear. Treatment of TB and ART should be continued, and the patient may require additional supportive care, such as corticosteroids, but this should be done under close supervision and with caution due to potential risks of immunosuppression and TB exacerbation.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, morbid obesity, and 2+ proteinuria, I would consider several potential etiologies. However, given the patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and difficulty climbing stairs, I would initially suspect renal impairment.\n\nThe presence of proteinuria (2+ protein in the urine) suggests kidney damage or disease. Considering the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, I would also consider the possibility of HIV-associated nephropathy, also known as HIV-associated kidney disease or HIVAN. This is a common cause of kidney disease in HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with low CD4 counts and poorly controlled viral loads.\n\nThe patient's remote history of heroin addiction may also be relevant, as intravenous drug use can lead to renal impairment due to various mechanisms, including nephrotoxic substances and potential endocarditis or other vascular complications.\n\nHowever, without further diagnostic testing (e.g., serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and possibly a kidney biopsy), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact etiology. I would recommend further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the patient's kidney disease and proteinuria.\n\nLet's order some additional tests, such as a complete metabolic panel (CMP), a serum creatinine level, and a urinalysis with microscopy to further assess the patient's renal function and potential underlying causes of his symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, I would suspect Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients. The widening of the mediastinum on the chest X-ray is consistent with this diagnosis, as PCP can cause bilateral interstitial infiltrates and a widened mediastinum.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and tachycardia are also consistent with PCP. The missed doses of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have compromised his immune system, making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections.\n\nTo reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities, we need to start him on PCP prophylaxis and treat his PCP infection. This would involve starting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as soon as possible, and also restarting his ART regimen to ensure adherence.\n\nAdditionally, considering his recent fall and loss of balance, a lumbar puncture to check for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and possibly toxoplasmosis (another opportunistic infection) should be considered.\n\nHowever, the most likely immediate concern is the patient's respiratory symptoms, and treating the PCP infection should take priority.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's lab results, the most likely diagnosis is Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). This is a complication of chemotherapy, particularly in patients with bulky lymphoma like Burkitt's lymphoma. The elevated serum uric acid, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium), and acute kidney injury (indicated by the elevated creatinine and BUN) are classic findings of TLS.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
