    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV diagnosis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. \n\nThe primary method of HIV diagnosis is through blood tests that detect the presence of the virus or the body's immune response to it. There are two types of tests:\n\n1.  **Rapid tests**: These are point-of-care tests that provide quick results, usually within 20-30 minutes. They detect antibodies or antigens (substances produced by the virus) in the blood.\n2.  **Serum tests**: These are laboratory tests that analyze blood samples for antibodies or antigens. They are more sensitive and specific than rapid tests.\n3.  **Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**: These tests detect the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of the virus in the blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. They are highly sensitive and specific.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a two-step testing approach:\n\n1.  **Screening**: A rapid or serum test to detect HIV antibodies or antigens.\n2.  **Confirmation**: A second test, usually a NAT or a more specific antibody test, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA positive result on any of these tests indicates HIV infection. A negative result does not rule out HIV, especially if the test was done early after exposure.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "There are three main stages of HIV infection: \n\n1. **Acute HIV infection**: This is the initial stage of HIV infection, which occurs within 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus. During this stage, the virus replicates rapidly, and the person may experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Clinical latency (also known as chronic HIV infection)**: This stage can last for many years, even decades, if left untreated. During this stage, the virus continues to replicate at a slower rate, and the person may not show any symptoms. However, the virus is still present in the body and can be transmitted to others.\n\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: This is the final stage of HIV infection, which occurs when the immune system is severely weakened due to prolonged HIV infection. AIDS is characterized by the presence of certain opportunistic infections or cancers, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or Kaposi's sarcoma.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing various comorbidities due to chronic inflammation, immune system suppression, and shared risk factors. Some common comorbidities include:\n\n1. Cardiovascular disease: Increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease.\n2. Chronic kidney disease: HIV itself and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can affect kidney function.\n3. Liver disease: Hepatitis B and C co-infections are common, and HIV can also cause liver damage.\n4. Neurological disorders: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), peripheral neuropathy, and seizures.\n5. Osteoporosis: Weakened bones due to HIV and ART.\n6. Mental health disorders: Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders are more prevalent.\n7. Cancer: Increased risk of non-AIDS-defining cancers, such as lung, liver, and anal cancer.\n8. Diabetes: Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are common due to HIV and ART.\n9. Bone marrow suppression: Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia can occur due to HIV or ART.\n10. Tuberculosis (TB): Immune suppression increases the risk of TB infection.\n\nIt's essential to note that these comorbidities can be managed and even prevented with proper HIV care, ART adherence, and regular monitoring.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "Prevention of HIV involves a combination of methods. Here are some effective ways:\n\n1.  **Safe sex practices**: Use condoms correctly every time you have sex, and consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for individuals at high risk.\n2.  **Testing and treatment**: Regular HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those living with HIV can prevent transmission to others.\n3.  **Vaccination**: There is no licensed HIV vaccine available yet, but research is ongoing.\n4.  **Avoid sharing needles**: Use clean needles and syringes, or consider needle exchange programs.\n5.  **Blood screening**: Ensure that blood products are screened for HIV before transfusion.\n6.  **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Take PEP within 72 hours after potential exposure to HIV.\n\nRemember, prevention is key to controlling the spread of HIV.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV typically needs to be taken daily, as a combination of medications. The specific regimen and dosing schedule may vary depending on the individual patient's needs and the type of medications prescribed. However, the general guideline is to take ART once or twice daily, with the most common regimen being once daily. Adherence to the prescribed schedule is crucial for maintaining viral suppression and preventing resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Preventing perinatal transmission of HIV involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Prenatal care**: HIV-infected women should receive regular prenatal care, including HIV viral load monitoring and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve viral suppression.\n2. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: ART should be started as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, ideally before 28 weeks of gestation. This reduces the risk of transmission to less than 1%.\n3. **Elective cesarean delivery**: Women with a high viral load (>1000 copies/mL) or those with a history of previous perinatal transmission may benefit from an elective cesarean delivery before the onset of labor and before the rupture of membranes.\n4. **Avoid breastfeeding**: Exclusive formula feeding is recommended to prevent postnatal transmission through breast milk.\n5. **Antiretroviral prophylaxis**: The mother should receive antiretroviral prophylaxis during labor, typically with a combination of zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC).\n6. **Neonatal prophylaxis**: The newborn should receive zidovudine (AZT) within 6 hours of birth and for 6 weeks to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission.\n\nThese measures significantly reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, making it possible for HIV-positive women to have healthy, HIV-negative children.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) are related but distinct conditions.\n\nHIV is a viral infection that attacks the body's immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells). If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS.\n\nAIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by a severely weakened immune system. When the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, or when the individual develops specific opportunistic infections or cancers, it's considered AIDS.\n\nIn other words, HIV is the virus itself, while AIDS is the condition that results from a long-term, untreated HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is not transmitted through:\n\n1. Casual contact: hugging, kissing, shaking hands, or sharing food and drinks.\n2. Insects like mosquitoes or ticks.\n3. Animals, unless they are infected with a specific strain of SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus).\n4. Sweat, saliva, or tears.\n5. Coughing or sneezing.\n\nHowever, HIV can be transmitted through:\n\n1. Unprotected sex with an infected person.\n2. Sharing needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood.\n3. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, if the mother is not on effective treatment.\n\nIt's essential to note that HIV can only be transmitted through bodily fluids that contain the virus, such as blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch from latent HIV to active infection is a complex process, but it's largely understood as a reactivation of the virus from a dormant state. \n\nLatent HIV integrates into the host's genome as a provirus, and the virus is not actively replicating. However, the immune system can't eliminate the virus entirely. \n\nReactivation is often triggered by immune system suppression, such as during untreated HIV infection or when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is stopped. Additionally, other factors like inflammation, immune activation, and certain co-infections can also contribute to reactivation.\n\nWhen the virus reactivates, it can lead to a resurgence of viral replication, resulting in detectable viremia and potentially, a decrease in CD4 T-cell counts.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
