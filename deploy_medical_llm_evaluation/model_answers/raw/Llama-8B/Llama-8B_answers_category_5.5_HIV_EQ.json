    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient's condition is most likely due to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nThe patient's low CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L and history of skipping antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is used to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), increase her risk for opportunistic infections. The MRI findings of numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect, along with the brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes, are characteristic of PML. \n\nPML is a rare but serious complication of HIV infection, caused by the JC virus reactivation in individuals with severely compromised immune systems.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's new HIV diagnosis and the prescribed treatment regimen, which includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for several potential adverse effects. \n\n1.  **Pancreatitis**: As you mentioned, indinavir is known to cause pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas. This is a serious side effect that requires close monitoring.\n\n2.  **Nephrolithiasis**: Indinavir can also cause kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) due to its crystalluria. This is another potential complication that the patient should be aware of.\n\n3.  **Hyperlipidemia**: Indinavir can cause changes in lipid profiles, leading to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Monitoring of lipid profiles will be necessary to manage this risk.\n\n4.  **Diarrhea**: Lamivudine and zidovudine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea.\n\n5.  **Hepatotoxicity**: Although less likely with the combination of lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, liver function should be monitored regularly to detect any signs of hepatotoxicity.\n\nIt's essential to closely monitor the patient for these potential adverse effects and adjust the treatment regimen as necessary to minimize risks and maximize the effectiveness of the therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), particularly given the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI. PCNSL is a type of lymphoma that primarily affects the central nervous system, often in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV.\n\nThe presence of EBV in the CSF is a strong indicator of PCNSL, as EBV is a known causative agent in this type of lymphoma. The patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy and low CD4 count also increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Glioblastoma is a possibility, the presence of EBV in the CSF and the patient's immunocompromised state make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, lab results, and chest x-ray findings, the most likely causal organism is Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). This is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm\u00b3, but in this case, the patient's CD4 count is 520/mm\u00b3, which is above the typical threshold. However, the patient has a history of HIV and has been on antiretroviral therapy for 4 years, which may not be sufficient to completely suppress the virus and prevent opportunistic infections.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are consistent with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients. The recent exposure to a patient with Staphylococcus aureus does not make it the most likely causal organism in this case.",

He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Mycobacterium avium. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely causal organism is Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The patient's low CD4 count (180/mm3), skin lesions, hepatomegaly, and abdominal ultrasonography findings are consistent with disseminated MAC infection. The biopsy of the skin lesion showing vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils also supports this diagnosis. The negative rapid plasma reagin test makes syphilis less likely.",

The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Entamoeba histolytica. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, travel history, and the presence of oocysts on the modified acid-fast stain, the most likely causal organism is Cryptosporidium. \n\nThe presence of oocysts in the stool is a key diagnostic clue. Cryptosporidiosis is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, especially when they have a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. The patient's low CD4 count of 85/mm3 and history of noncompliance with HIV therapy increase her susceptibility to opportunistic infections like Cryptosporidiosis.\n\nWhile Entamoeba histolytica can cause diarrhea, it typically produces cysts rather than oocysts, and the modified acid-fast stain would not be the primary diagnostic method for this organism.",

He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as vascular dementia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The patient's symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, difficulty with daily activities, and right lower extremity weakness, are consistent with HAD. The patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) also support this diagnosis. The disseminated white matter lesions on the MRI are also consistent with HIV-associated neuroinflammation.\n\nWhile vascular dementia is a possibility, the patient's age, HIV status, and the presence of disseminated white matter lesions make HAND a more likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of noncompliance with medications, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), likely contributed to the progression of HIV disease and the development of HAND.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result is not directly relevant to the current presentation, as it suggests past exposure to the parasite, but not an active infection.",

This is standard practice for infants born to HIV-positive mothers who received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. The goal is to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the risk of mother-to-child transmission is already significantly reduced. Nonetheless, administering zidovudine to the newborn for 6 weeks is still recommended to provide additional protection.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HIV testing for the infant at 14-16 days and 1-2 months of age, regardless of the mother's HIV status.

This is especially concerning given his low CD4 count (280/mm3) and history of HIV infection.\n\nPCP is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and is often characterized by symptoms such as cough, fever, night sweats, and malodorous phlegm.\n\nThe mention of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is unrelated to the patient's current symptoms. It's a condition where a pouch forms in the esophagus, but it does not typically cause the symptoms described in this patient.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's history of heavy smoking and alcohol use may also contribute to his respiratory symptoms, but the combination of his immunocompromised state and the specific symptoms and radiographic findings point more strongly towards PCP.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness, fever, and immunocompromised state (HIV with a low CD4 count), the differential diagnosis should include opportunistic infections. However, the use of empiric itraconazole for the past 10 years suggests that the hospital has a high prevalence of fungal infections, and the patient's symptoms could be related to a fungal infection.\n\nThe first step would be to consider imaging studies to evaluate for central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as an MRI or CT scan of the brain and spine, to rule out conditions like cryptococcal meningitis, which is more common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. \n\nAdditionally, a lumbar puncture (LP) should be considered to evaluate for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities, such as elevated opening pressure, pleocytosis, or fungal elements.\n\nIt's also essential to review the patient's medication adherence and adjust his antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen if necessary, as poor adherence can lead to treatment failure and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.\n\nLastly, the patient's fever and hypertension should be managed appropriately with antipyretics and antihypertensives, respectively.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks' gestation, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the following tests:\n\n1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia and other hematologic abnormalities.\n2. Blood Type and Rh factor to determine if the patient is Rh-negative and needs Rh immunoglobulin.\n3. Urine pregnancy test to confirm the pregnancy and screen for proteinuria and glucose.\n4. Urinalysis to check for proteinuria, glucose, and leukocyte esterase (indicative of a urinary tract infection).\n5. Rubella serology to check for immunity to rubella (German measles), as this is a live virus vaccine and should be administered if the patient is not immune.\n6. Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening, but since this test is usually performed at 35-37 weeks, it can be deferred for now.\n7. HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae re-testing, although the patient tested negative 4 years ago, due to the risk of reinfection.\n8. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs) to check for hepatitis B status.\n9. Syphilis screening, as this is a congenital infection risk.\n10. Fetal ultrasound to confirm the gestational age and rule out any fetal abnormalities.\n\nNote that the patient's past test results are not up-to-date, so re-testing is recommended.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and biopsy results, it appears she has cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis (CBA), likely caused by Bartonella henselae. The presence of white patches on her palate that can be scraped off suggests oral hairy leukoplakia, which is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients with HIV.\n\nConsidering the patient's low CD4 count (98/mm3), the use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not sufficient for this case. \n\nThe recommended treatment for CBA is Erythromycin 500 mg PO QID for 6-8 weeks, or Azithromycin 1g PO weekly for 6-8 weeks. \n\nHowever, given the patient's immunocompromised state, I would recommend consulting with an infectious disease specialist for further guidance on the most appropriate treatment regimen, which may also include antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage her HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the physical examination findings, the lesions described are likely condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts. The fact that the lesions turned white with the application of 5% acetic acid solution (a process known as \"acetowhitening\") further supports this diagnosis.\n\nHowever, attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV types 16 & 18 is an oversimplification. While HPV 16 and 18 are high-risk types associated with cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers, the most common types associated with genital warts are low-risk types, such as HPV 6 and 11. These types are also the most common cause of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is paradoxical reaction to antitubercular therapy, which is a known complication in HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis. This reaction is characterized by worsening symptoms and new findings, despite initial improvement on therapy.\n\nThe initial step in treatment should not be to change the antitubercular regimen to the hospital's standard regimen (isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin), as this would likely be a worsening of the situation due to the potential for pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity in this patient, especially with the addition of rifampin.\n\nInstead, the most appropriate initial step is to continue the current antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) and add corticosteroids (such as prednisone) to manage the paradoxical reaction. The patient's HIV treatment should also be optimized, and the CD4 count has improved significantly, but the viral load is still elevated. The HIV treatment regimen can be adjusted if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, morbid obesity, and 1+ pitting edema, I would like to consider alternative diagnoses beyond Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). MPGN is a pattern of glomerulonephritis, but it's not a specific diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of heroin addiction and poorly controlled HIV, I would suspect HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) as a more likely etiology. HIVAN is a common cause of kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals, particularly those with poorly controlled HIV.\n\nThe presence of proteinuria (2+ proteinuria) and edema also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fatigue and nausea could be related to the progression of kidney disease.\n\nIt's essential to note that a kidney biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but based on the clinical presentation, HIVAN should be a primary consideration.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, particularly the widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray and the presence of a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur, I suspect Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) as a complication of untreated or undertreated Syphilis, but given his HIV status, I'm also considering Neurosyphilis. However, the described symptoms do not strongly support Syphilis as the primary cause.\n\nFor diagnosing Syphilis, the most reliable assays are:\n\n1. **Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA)**: This is a sensitive and specific test for detecting antibodies against Syphilis. It's the preferred test for diagnosing Syphilis in patients with a high pre-test probability.\n2. **Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) with reflex to fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)**: This is another combination test that's used for confirmatory purposes.\n\nThe Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is actually used for diagnosing rheumatic fever, which is a complication of untreated or undertreated Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) infection, not Syphilis.\n\nGiven the patient's clinical presentation, it would be essential to perform a thorough evaluation for both Syphilis and HIV-related complications.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's laboratory studies, the most likely diagnosis is tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of chemotherapy that causes rapid cell breakdown, leading to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury.\n\nThe patient's serum uric acid level of 28 mg/dL is significantly elevated, indicating uric acid nephropathy, a component of TLS. The use of Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is not effective in this scenario because it only works by reducing uric acid production, but it does not address the existing hyperuricemia.\n\nThe therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities would be to initiate aggressive hydration, usually with intravenous fluids, and allopurinol should be discontinued. Instead, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with rasburicase, a uricase enzyme that breaks down uric acid into allantoin, should be initiated. This can help rapidly reduce uric acid levels and prevent further kidney damage.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
