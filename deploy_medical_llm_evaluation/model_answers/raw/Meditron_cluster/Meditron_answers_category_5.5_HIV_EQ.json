    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are most consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus. PML is a serious opportunistic infection that can occur in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts. The patient's history of skipping doses of her antiretroviral medications and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole likely contributed to her low CD4 count and increased risk of developing PML. The brain biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes are also consistent with PML. Treatment for PML typically involves antiretroviral therapy to improve the patient's immune function, but there is no specific treatment for the virus itself.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results suggest a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's low CD4 count and inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL. Glioblastoma is a type of brain tumor that is less common in HIV-positive individuals, and the imaging findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are more consistent with PCNSL.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that she has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which indicates advanced HIV disease. The presence of white patches on her palate that can be scraped off is consistent with oral thrush, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. The biopsy of the skin lesion showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is indicative of bacillary angiomatosis, which is caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. Given that the patient has advanced HIV disease and is at high risk for opportunistic infections, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible, along with treatment for the specific opportunistic infection. The recommended treatment for bacillary angiomatosis is a combination of doxycycline and rifampin. Additionally, the patient should be treated for oral thrush with an antifungal medication such as fluconazole.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The patient's skin findings are consistent with condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts, which are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11, not types 16 and 18. HPV types 16 and 18 are associated with cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers. The use of 5% acetic acid solution is a diagnostic tool that can help identify the lesions as they turn white when applied. The patient should be advised to use condoms to prevent transmission of HPV and to undergo regular follow-up with a healthcare provider for monitoring and treatment of the lesions.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). IRIS occurs when the immune system becomes overactive in response to ART, leading to inflammation and worsening of symptoms. The patient's improved CD4+ T cell count and decreased HIV RNA level also support this diagnosis. The appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue the current antitubercular therapy and ART, and to consider adding corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory response.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, morbid obesity, and proteinuria are suggestive of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a common cause of kidney disease in patients with HIV and is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and renal failure. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a different type of kidney disease that is not typically associated with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of syphilis, specifically neurosyphilis. The presence of a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur and widening of the mediastinum on chest x-ray suggests syphilitic aortitis, which can lead to aortic regurgitation and aneurysm formation. The neurological findings, including pupillary abnormalities and loss of balance, are also consistent with neurosyphilis. The Antistreptolysin O titer is not a reliable test for syphilis. The most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis is the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) or the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. These tests detect antibodies to T. Pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a complication of cancer treatment that results in the rapid breakdown of cancer cells and release of their contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, which can cause acute kidney injury. The patient's elevated creatinine, BUN, and uric acid levels, as well as her decreased urinary output, are consistent with TLS. \n\nThe therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive hydration, electrolyte correction, and the use of a medication to prevent hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is a medication that inhibits the production of uric acid and is commonly used to prevent TLS. However, it is not recommended to use allopurinol alone in the setting of established TLS, as it can actually worsen the condition. Instead, rasburicase, a recombinant uricase enzyme, is recommended for the treatment of TLS. Rasburicase rapidly breaks down uric acid into allantoin, which is more soluble and can be easily excreted by the kidneys.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
