    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises within the brain, and it is more common in patients with HIV infection, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL, as this virus is associated with the development of lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is called Enfuvirtide (also known as T-20). However, it is not commonly used in first-line treatment regimens and is typically reserved for patients with drug-resistant HIV. The patient should be started on a combination of antiretroviral medications that target different stages of the HIV life cycle, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). The specific regimen should be tailored to the patient's viral load, CD4 count, and other factors, and should be chosen in consultation with an HIV specialist.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
    "answer": "This patient is most likely in the acute stage of HIV infection. The acute stage typically occurs within 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus and is characterized by symptoms such as fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. The CD4+ count of 650/mm3 is also consistent with this stage, as the CD4+ count typically remains high in the acute stage before dropping in later stages of the infection.",
    "true_answer": "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection, likely caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The most appropriate drug for managing this patient's condition is azithromycin. Azithromycin works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA and inhibiting peptide chain elongation. This leads to the death of the bacterial cells.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate diagnostic test for detecting HIV infection in the newborn is the HIV DNA or RNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. This test detects the presence of the HIV virus in the baby's blood and is typically performed within 48 hours of birth. The test is highly sensitive and specific and can detect HIV infection as early as 14 days after exposure. The HIV antibody test is not recommended for newborns because the antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, resulting in a false positive result.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The most likely etiology of this patient's condition is acute pancreatitis. The patient's symptoms of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The laboratory findings of elevated serum amylase and lipase also support this diagnosis. The CT findings of an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection are also characteristic of acute pancreatitis. Given her HIV status, it is important to consider drug-induced pancreatitis as a possible cause, as some antiretroviral medications are associated with pancreatitis. Other potential causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia. Further evaluation may be needed to determine the underlying cause of the pancreatitis.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that disrupts the biological process of reverse transcription, which is necessary for HIV replication. Reverse transcription is the process by which the viral RNA is converted into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell genome. Zidovudine works by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, thereby preventing the conversion of viral RNA into DNA and ultimately inhibiting viral replication.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection have been studied to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV latency and pathogenesis. It has been observed that there is a significant increase in DNA methylation in the HIV-1 promoter region in latently infected cells, which contributes to the suppression of viral gene expression. In contrast, active HIV-1 infection is associated with a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoter region, allowing for the transcription of viral genes. These findings suggest that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression and may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling HIV-1 replication and latency.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
