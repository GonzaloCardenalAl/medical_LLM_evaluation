    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed by the physician scientist is the gp120 protein, which is one of the HIV envelope proteins. This protein is the primary target of the natural humoral immune response and is also the target of many current HIV vaccines and therapies. The gp120 protein is responsible for binding to the CD4 receptor on host cells and is a key component of the HIV envelope that is exposed to the immune system. Therefore, generating a potent antibody against gp120 could potentially be an effective strategy for treating HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). It works by inhibiting the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that is essential for the replication of retroviruses such as HIV. Reverse transcriptase is responsible for converting the viral RNA into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome. By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, zidovudine disrupts the viral replication cycle and reduces the viral load. This can help to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV from mother to child during childbirth.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."
