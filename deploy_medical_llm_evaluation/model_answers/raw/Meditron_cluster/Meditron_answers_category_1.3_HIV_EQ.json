    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed using a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies to the virus. This test is usually done after a person has had a potential exposure to HIV, such as unprotected sex or sharing needles. The test can also be done as part of routine screening for people who are at high risk of HIV infection. In some cases, a rapid test may be used to get results quickly, but these tests are not as accurate as the standard blood test. If the test is positive, further testing is done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the viral load, which is the amount of virus in the blood.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "The different stages of HIV are:\n\n1. Acute HIV infection: This is the initial stage of HIV infection, usually occurring within the first two to four weeks after exposure. During this stage, the virus replicates rapidly and the immune system begins to respond.\n\n2. Clinical latency (also called chronic HIV infection): This is the stage that follows acute HIV infection, and it can last for years. During this stage, the virus continues to replicate but at a slower rate, and the immune system continues to respond.\n\n3. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome): This is the final stage of HIV infection, and it occurs when the immune system is severely weakened by the virus. At this stage, the body is unable to fight off opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented by avoiding high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, and engaging in risky sexual practices. Using condoms and practicing safe sex, getting tested regularly for HIV, and taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication can also help prevent HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "The frequency of taking ART depends on the specific medication prescribed. Some medications are taken once a day, while others are taken twice a day. It is important to follow the medication schedule as prescribed by your healthcare provider to ensure optimal treatment and prevent drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "## Cell Types Infected with HIV\n\nHIV primarily targets and infects cells of the immune system. The main cell types infected with HIV are:\n\n### 1. CD4+ T Cells\nCD4+ T cells, also known as T helper cells, play a crucial role in the immune system by helping to activate and coordinate the immune response. HIV infects and destroys these cells, leading to a weakened immune system and increased susceptibility to infections and diseases.\n\n### 2. Macrophages\nMacrophages are a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests foreign particles, bacteria, and dead cells. HIV can also infect macrophages, which can act as reservoirs for the virus, making it difficult to eradicate the infection.\n\n### 3. Dendritic Cells\nDendritic cells are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the initiation of the immune response. They can also be infected with HIV, which can disrupt the immune system's ability to respond to infections and diseases.\n\n### Summary:\nHIV primarily infects and destroys CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to a weakened immune system and increased susceptibility to infections and diseases.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "## Switch from Latent HIV to Active Infection\n\nThe switch from latent HIV to active infection is a complex process that involves various factors. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, research suggests that:\n\n*   **Viral Replication**: The virus may reactivate from latency due to various triggers, such as changes in the immune system or exposure to certain medications.\n*   **Immune System Suppression**: Weakening of the immune system can allow the virus to replicate more freely, leading to the progression from latent to active infection.\n*   **Genetic Factors**: Certain genetic mutations or variations may influence the likelihood of the virus switching from latent to active infection.\n\nHowever, the exact switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection is still not fully understood and requires further research.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
