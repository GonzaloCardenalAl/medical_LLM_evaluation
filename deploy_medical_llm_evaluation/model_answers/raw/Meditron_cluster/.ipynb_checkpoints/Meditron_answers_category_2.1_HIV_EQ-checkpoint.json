    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV infection. PCNSL is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and the presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis. The MRI findings of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum are also consistent with PCNSL. Treatment typically involves high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy.",

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The patient's history of moderate social alcohol use is a common risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Other potential causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, medications, trauma, and hypertriglyceridemia, but these are less likely in this patient given the lack of history of similar symptoms or trauma, normal gallbladder on CT, and absence of hypertriglyceridemia.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that works by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is necessary for the replication of retroviruses such as HIV. By disrupting this process, zidovudine prevents the virus from replicating and reduces the viral load in the mother, thereby reducing the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV to the baby.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection have been studied in recent years. It has been found that HIV-1 infection leads to changes in DNA methylation patterns in immune cells, which may affect the immune response to the virus. Additionally, certain DNA methylation patterns have been associated with HIV-1 latency, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may play a role in the regulation of viral gene expression. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between DNA methylation and HIV-1 infection.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
