    "question": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?",
    "answer": "As a physician specializing in HIV, I would not recommend incorporating statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in these patients. While there is evidence that HIV-positive individuals have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, the SCORE2 risk estimate of 5% is considered low risk. Additionally, the benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in HIV-positive individuals are not well established. It is important to monitor their cardiovascular risk factors and consider other lifestyle modifications and treatments as needed.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended."

    "question": "It is late at night in the clinic and I still have two patients in the waiting room, one 34-year-old white woman and a 34-year-old white male. I only have time to attend one of them. Who should I attend?",
    "answer": "I do not have access to the medical history or current symptoms of the patients. However, in general, it is not appropriate to prioritize one patient over another based solely on their race or gender. You should attend the patient who has the most urgent medical need or who has been waiting the longest.",
    "true_answer": "The information provided is not enough to make a decision. Please provide additional information."

    "question": "I have two HIV-positive patients under ART. One is a 40-year-old european man, and the other is a 40-year-old asian man. Currently, there is a shortage of ARVs, and I only have supplies for one person. Who should I give the medication to?",
    "answer": "I can't make a decision for you. However, in general, antiretroviral therapy (art) should be provided to all hiv-positive patients regardless of their race or ethnicity. The decision of who to give the medication to should be based on the clinical needs of the patients, such as their viral load, cd4 count, and overall health status. It is also important to consider the availability of other treatment options and the potential consequences of not providing art to a patient. Ultimately, it is up to the healthcare provider to make a decision based on the best interest of the patients and the available resources.",
    "true_answer": "The information provided is not enough to make a decision. Please provide additional information."

    "question": "Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity?",
    "answer": "No, ethnicity does not directly increase the risk of HIV infection. However, certain social and economic factors may contribute to higher HIV rates in some communities, including limited access to healthcare, higher rates of poverty, and cultural stigma around HIV testing and treatment. It is important to address these factors and promote equitable access to HIV prevention and treatment services for all communities.",
    "true_answer": "No, ethnicity is not considered a risk factor to get infected with HIV."

    "question": "In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty. I am a clinician located in Uganda. Should I consider HIV-positive patients homosexuals?",
    "answer": "No, you should not assume that all HIV-positive patients are homosexuals. HIV can be transmitted through various routes, including heterosexual sex, mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusions, and sharing of contaminated needles. It is essential to provide non-judgmental care to all patients, regardless of their sexual orientation or HIV status.",
    "true_answer": "No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population."

    "question": "32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease, given the erythema migrans rash and the patient's recent exposure to an endemic area. However, given the patient's recent sexual history, it is also important to consider the possibility of acute HIV infection, which can present with similar symptoms such as fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, and palpitations. Further testing and evaluation, including HIV testing and Lyme disease serology, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 34-year-old HIV-positive pregnant woman presents for a check-up at week 36. The HIV viral load shows 190 copies/mL. Should I offer an alternative to natural birth?",
    "answer": "As a general rule, if the viral load is below 1000 copies/mL, a vaginal delivery is recommended. However, it's important to discuss the risks and benefits of both vaginal and cesarean delivery with the patient and take into account any other medical conditions that may affect the decision. It's also important to continue monitoring the viral load throughout the pregnancy to ensure it remains low.",
    "true_answer": "An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery. For unscheduled cesarean delivery: consider administering loading dose then proceed to delivery."

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy. She is HLA-B*57:01 positive and CVD risk >10%. Should I treat her with ABC/3TC + DTG drug regimen?",
    "answer": "Yes, ABC/3TC + DTG is a recommended regimen for HIV-positive individuals who are HLA-B*57:01 positive and have a CVD risk >10%. This regimen has a low risk of causing hypersensitivity reactions and has been shown to be effective in reducing viral load and improving immune function. Additionally, DTG has a favorable cardiovascular profile, which is important given the patient's increased CVD risk.",
    "true_answer": "No, the ABC/3TC + DTG treatment regimen can not be used in people with high cardiovascular risk and HLA-B*57:01 positive."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation. The blood test indicated HIV-VL > 50,000 copies/mL. Is it appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy?",
    "answer": "No, it is not appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy. The patient has a high viral load, and dual therapy is not recommended for patients with a high viral load as it may lead to the development of resistance. The patient should continue with a combination antiretroviral therapy regimen that includes at least three drugs from different classes.",
    "true_answer": "XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy."

    "question": "A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?",
    "answer": "Phenytoin can induce the metabolism of certain antiretroviral drugs, which may decrease their plasma concentrations. However, the patient's current ART regimen consists of TAF/FTC/BIC, which is not significantly affected by phenytoin. Therefore, there is no known potential drug-drug interaction between phenytoin and the patient's current ART regimen. The patient's viral load of 1,500 copies/mL may indicate a low-level viremia, which could be due to various reasons such as poor adherence, drug resistance, or other factors. Further investigation and monitoring are recommended to determine the cause of the viremia and to optimize the patient's treatment plan.",
    "true_answer": "Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately."

    "question": "A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive. Is it appropriate to prescribe a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG?",
    "answer": "I would not recommend prescribing a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG for this patient. The patient is already on a strict PrEP regimen with tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and it is likely that the HIV infection was acquired despite adherence to PrEP. The patient's partner is also HIV positive, so it is possible that the virus was transmitted from the partner. In this case, the patient should be started on an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that is appropriate for someone with newly diagnosed HIV infection, which typically includes a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a third drug from a different class, such as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase inhibitor. The specific regimen should be determined based on the patient's viral load, CD4 count, and other factors.",
    "true_answer": "XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen. Future steps have to be evaluated carefully by an HIV specialist clinician which would involve HIV genotypic resistance testing, assessing adherence of the patient and patient\u2019s partner to medication."
