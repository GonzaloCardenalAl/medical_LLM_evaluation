    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation and MRI findings suggest progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus. This is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV, particularly those with low CD4 counts. The patient's non-adherence to her antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis likely contributed to the development of PML. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a different condition, characterized by cognitive and motor impairments, but it does not typically present with the same MRI findings or brain biopsy results as PML.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, recent inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid further supports this diagnosis, as EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients. While glioblastoma is a possibility, the presence of EBV DNA and the patient's immunocompromised status make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis.",

What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation of skin lesions, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count suggest an opportunistic infection. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils suggest Kaposi's sarcoma, which is caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). The negative rapid plasma reagin test helps to rule out syphilis, which can also cause skin lesions and hepatomegaly. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) can also cause similar symptoms in patients with advanced HIV infection, but the biopsy findings are not consistent with MAC infection.",

She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's clinical presentation, the diagnosis is most likely Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a skin infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain are characteristic of this condition. The recommended treatment for BA is a combination of antibiotics, such as erythromycin or doxycycline, and rifampin. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count increase her risk for opportunistic infections, including BA. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be erythromycin or doxycycline combined with rifampin.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "The etiology of these lesions is human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically types 16 and 18, which are known to cause genital warts. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causing the lesions to turn white is a common diagnostic test for HPV. Given the patient's history of HIV and multiple sexual partners, it is not surprising that he has developed these lesions.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest a paradoxical worsening of tuberculosis, also known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This occurs when the immune system is restored by antiretroviral therapy and mounts an inflammatory response against the tuberculosis bacteria. The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue the current antitubercular regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol) and antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine) while managing the symptoms of IRIS with supportive care and possibly corticosteroids. The addition of streptomycin is not necessary in this case as the patient is already smear-negative and there is no evidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV and proteinuria, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a common cause of kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals and can lead to progressive kidney failure if not treated appropriately. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and edema are consistent with chronic kidney disease, and the proteinuria on urinalysis supports this diagnosis. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a different condition that can also cause proteinuria and kidney disease, but it is less common in HIV-positive individuals.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation of a patient with HIV, fever, and a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur, along with a chest x-ray showing widening of the mediastinum, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis. The most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis is blood cultures. Blood cultures should be obtained from at least two separate sites and at different times to increase the sensitivity of the test. In addition to blood cultures, an echocardiogram should also be performed to evaluate for the presence of valvular vegetations or other signs of endocarditis. Antistreptolysin O titer is not a reliable assay for diagnosing infective endocarditis.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation of decreased urinary output, elevated creatinine, BUN, and serum uric acid, along with hyperkalemia, is suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is a common complication of chemotherapy in patients with high tumor burden, such as Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma. The therapy to reverse the metabolic abnormalities of TLS is aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and the use of a medication called Rasburicase. Allopurinol can be used to prevent TLS, but it is not effective in treating established TLS.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
