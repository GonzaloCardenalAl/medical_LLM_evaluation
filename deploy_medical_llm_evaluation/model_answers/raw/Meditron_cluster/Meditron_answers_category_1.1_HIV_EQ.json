    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies to the virus, which can take up to 3 months to develop after exposure. There are also rapid tests available that can detect the presence of HIV antigens in the blood within minutes. If the initial test is positive, a confirmatory test is performed to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "There are three stages of HIV: acute HIV, clinical latency, and AIDS. Acute HIV is the initial stage of infection, which can cause flu-like symptoms. Clinical latency is the stage where the virus is still present in the body but is not actively replicating, and symptoms may not be present. AIDS is the final stage, where the virus has severely weakened the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person, sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs, or through mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. It can also be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ transplants from an infected donor.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at increased risk of developing a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. These comorbidities can be caused by the virus itself, antiretroviral therapy (ART), or other factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and obesity. Regular monitoring and management of these comorbidities is important for the overall health and well-being of people living with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented by practicing safe sex, using condoms, avoiding sharing needles or syringes, and avoiding contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person. Additionally, antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection in individuals at high risk of acquiring the virus.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) must be taken daily, at the same time every day, as prescribed by the healthcare provider. It is essential to maintain adherence to the medication regimen to ensure viral suppression and prevent drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

  {
    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Preventing perinatal transmission of HIV involves a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the mother, elective cesarean delivery, and post-exposure prophylaxis for the newborn. Pregnant women with HIV should receive ART throughout their pregnancy to reduce viral load and prevent transmission to the baby. If the viral load is not suppressed, an elective cesarean delivery should be performed before the onset of labor to reduce the risk of transmission. After birth, the newborn should receive post-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs for 6 weeks to prevent infection. Breastfeeding should be avoided, as it can transmit HIV to the baby.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which is a virus that attacks the immune system of the body. AIDS, on the other hand, stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, which is a condition that develops when HIV has severely damaged the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and diseases. In other words, AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

  {
    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is not transmitted through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, sharing food or drinks, or using the same toilet or shower. It is also not transmitted through insect bites or by breathing the same air as someone who is HIV-positive.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent HIV and active infection is not well understood and is an area of ongoing research. However, it is known that during latent infection, the virus is present in the body but is not actively replicating. The virus can remain in this state for many years, but at some point, it can reactivate and begin to replicate again, leading to active infection. This switch may be triggered by various factors, such as changes in the immune system or exposure to certain infections or medications. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this switch and to develop effective treatments for HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
