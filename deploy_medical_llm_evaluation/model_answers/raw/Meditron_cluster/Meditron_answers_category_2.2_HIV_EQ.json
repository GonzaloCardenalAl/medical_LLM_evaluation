    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient with HIV infection, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis and positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain, spinal cord, or eyes. It is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV infection and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. The MRI findings of a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum are consistent with PCNSL. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and antiretroviral therapy to improve immune function.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and findings on chest radiograph suggest pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods on bronchoalveolar lavage supports the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most appropriate drug for managing this patient's condition is isoniazid (INH), which is a first-line antitubercular agent. The mechanism of action of INH is the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis, which is essential for the cell wall structure of M. Tuberculosis.",
    "true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody the physician scientist is designing is the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120. This protein is the main target of the humoral immune response and is responsible for the initial binding of the virus to the CD4 receptor on host cells. Developing an antibody that can neutralize gp120 would be a promising strategy for preventing HIV infection or reducing viral load in infected individuals.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's elevated serum amylase and lipase levels along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection suggest acute pancreatitis. Given her history of HIV infection and the fact that she does not remember the names of her HIV medications, drug-induced pancreatitis should be considered as a possible etiology. Some antiretroviral medications, such as didanosine, stavudine, and zidovudine, have been associated with pancreatitis. Other potential causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercalcemia, but these are less likely given the patient's normal gallbladder and moderate alcohol use.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that works by inhibiting the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that is essential for the replication of HIV, as it converts viral RNA into DNA that can be integrated into the host cell genome. By inhibiting this enzyme, zidovudine prevents the virus from replicating and reduces the risk of perinatal transmission.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "I am not able to browse the internet or access the latest research. However, I can tell you that dna methylation is a process by which methyl groups are added to specific regions of the dna molecule. This process can affect gene expression, which is the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used to direct the assembly of a protein molecule. In the context of hiv-1 infection, dna methylation has been shown to play a role in the regulation of viral gene expression. Studies have found that changes in dna methylation patterns may be associated with the establishment of latent infection, as well as with the reactivation of the virus from latency. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of dna methylation in hiv-1 infection and to determine its potential as a therapeutic target.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
