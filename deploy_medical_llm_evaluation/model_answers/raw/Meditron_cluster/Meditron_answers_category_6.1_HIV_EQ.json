    "answer": "There is no specific data available for Switzerland on this topic. However, in general, studies have shown that younger individuals with HIV tend to have a faster progression of the disease compared to older individuals. This could be due to various factors such as differences in immune response, adherence to treatment, and access to healthcare. Therefore, it is possible that individuals tested before the age of 20 may have a shorter time for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 compared to those tested after the age of 20. However, this should be confirmed by specific studies in the Swiss population.",
