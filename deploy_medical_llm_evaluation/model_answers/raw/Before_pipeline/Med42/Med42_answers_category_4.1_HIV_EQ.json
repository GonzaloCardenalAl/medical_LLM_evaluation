Acetazolamide\nB. Prednisone\nC. Acyclovir\nD. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone)\nAnswer: D. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone)\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of headache, fever and fatigue and her immunosuppressed status, along with the lumbar puncture findings, are most consistent with Cryptococcal meningitis. This is an AIDS-defining illness and is diagnosed in around 8-10% of people with HIV. HIV infected individuals with low CD4 counts are most susceptible. The high opening pressure on lumbar puncture suggests increased intracranial pressure, and corticosteroids (dexamethasone) may be warranted to decrease this pressure and lower risk of further complications. Acetazolamide may decrease CSF production but is not commonly used in the setting of cryptococcal meningitis. There is no indication for acyclovir in this setting as herpesvirus does not cause meningitis in immunocompromised patients. Lastly, prednisone while an immune suppressant would not be used to treat a life-threatening infection like cryptococcal meningitis in an individual who is already immunocompromised.  So, the correct answer is: d. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) ",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",

What is the NPV of this novel test? \nA) 95%\nB) 98%\nC) 98.5%\nD) 99.4%\n\nAnswer: D) 99.4%\n\nExplanation: NPV (Negative Predictive Value) measures the proportion of true negatives among all negative test results. In this case, there were 240 true positives (patients with AIDS who tested positive) and 5 false positives (patients without AIDS who tested positive). However, we're interested in calculating NPV, so we focus on the true negatives\u2014the patients without AIDS who tested negative. \n\nOut of 250 patients without AIDS in the control group, 250 - 5 = 245 patients tested negative. This gives us our true negatives.\n\nNPV = (True Negatives) / (Total Tests with Negative Results)\nNPV = (245) / (245 in control + 10 false negatives from AIDS group* [assuming 250 AIDS patients - 240 true positives = 10 false negatives])\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV \u2248 0.994 or 99.4%\n\n*This problem does not explicitly state the false negatives in the AIDS group, but we can reasonably deduce this by subtracting the true positives from the total number of AIDS patients. This is assuming that every AIDS patient was either counted as a true positive or a false negative\u2014no one was unaccounted for.\n\nSo, with >99% confidence, a negative result on this novel AIDS screening examination suggests that the patient does not have AIDS, providing excellent negative predictive value.\nIf needed, consult resources: \n1.

A CT scan, though rapid, may not be sensitive enough for some of these etiologies, especially early infarcts or demyelinating diseases.\nGiven the acute onset and localized motor deficits, an MRI, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), will be more sensitive for detecting early ischemia. Coupled with the MRA (magnetic resonance angiography), this will evaluate major intracranial and neck vessels for possible stenosis or occlusion, giving both structural and vascular information. Aspirin might be premature (option C) without confirmation of ischemic stroke; empirical antibiotics (option E) would be unwarranted given no outward signs of meningitis; cardiac workup (option D) doesn't explain the focal neurological signs; an immediate jump to CNS lymphoma treatment (option B) is not justified; and while evaluating for systemic infection (option H) and optimizing HIV therapy (option I) are important in the overall management, they are secondary to urgently identifying the cause of new neurologic deficit. Neurology consultation (option F) would be reasonable, but not before imaging (MRI/MRA) has been done. In sum, MRI/MRA provides the best diagnostic yield in this context.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis? The correct answer to this biomedical question is: d. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) The patient has AIDS (CD4+ count < 200/\u03bcL), and it is likely that he has progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), as suggested by his cognitive impairment and MRI findings. PML typically causes nonenhancing white matter lesions in HIV/AIDS patients, while enhancing white matter lesions are more consistent with toxoplasmosis (choice e) or other opportunistic infections. PML is caused by JC virus and is more common in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV disease. HAND is a spectrum of cognitive disorders that can include asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder, and HIV-associated dementia. His recent history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy and low CD4+ count predispose him to opportunistic infections like PML. Lymphoma (choice a) is less likely given the absence of enhancing lesions, and no other indication of malignancy such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Cerebral abscess (choice b) is unlikely due to the lack of enhancing lesions and mass effect on MRI. Subacute combined degeneration (choice c) is a neurologic disorder associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, which is not consistent with the imaging findings or clinical presentation in this patient. Tuberculous meningitis (choice f) is possible in an HIV/AIDS patient, but it usually presents with fever, headache, and meningitic signs, which are not present in this case. CNS lymphoma (choice g) is relatively less common in HIV/AIDS patients and would typically present with enhancing lesions and mass effect on MRI, which are not seen in this case. Viral encephalitis (choice h) is also less likely without fever, headache, and other systemic symptoms. Ref: Gifford R., Kahn J. (2012). Chap. 120.

Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit? So, the correct answer is: a. Cervical cytology and rubella IgG antibody testing So, let's think about this step-by-step. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening for cervical cancer (cervical cytology) at initial prenatal visits because the yield of abnormal findings is very low for a woman who is not overdue for cervical screening. Instead, the test should be postponed until 6 weeks after delivery in patients with a normal last pap smear result before pregnancy. The rubella vaccine is recommended for women of reproductive age and childbearing years (12 to 49 years old) who are not pregnant and do not have evidence of immunity to rubella. It's not a standard screening test performed during the initial prenatal visit. Therefore, cervical cytology and rubella IgG antibody testing (option a) are not indicated at this visit. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening for neural tube defects and multiple gestation is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. Therefore, option b is incorrect. An initial HIV screen is recommended for all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit, irrespective of risk factors. Syphilis testing (RPR) should be undertaken in all women at the first prenatal visit because of its association with adverse outcomes, including early miscarriage, preterm labor, still-birth, and perinatal death, as well as vertical transmission to the fetus. Testing for HBsAg is recommended for all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit because of its association with high rates of vertical transmission to the newborn if not treated during childhood. Chlamydia testing should be performed at the initial prenatal visit for all women with risk factors, including women under 25 years of age or those who have not been previously tested or have a new sexual partner since their last tested negative for Chlamydia. Urinalysis for glycosuria and bacteriuria (option c) is done at the first prenatal visit, and it is recommended that all pregnant women have a screening urine culture between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation. Thus, options d and e are correct. Ref: Wootton A.M. (2011). Chapter 8. Syphilis. In R.L. Soto, L.M. Reifler, J.A. Strelitz (Eds), Medical Care of Vulnerable and Underserved Populations: A Manual for Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals. So, the correct answer is: d",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "answer": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? -Prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia: TMP-SMX or pentamidine (aerosolized) is recommended for this patient with high risk for P. jiroveci pneumonia. In general, this prophylaxis is given to HIV-positive individuals with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3. However, due to the recent non-adherence and low CD4+ count, prophylaxis is warranted. -Prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis: TMP-SMX should suffice since it provides protection against Toxoplasma gondii as well. However, if TMP-SMX is contraindicated or there's an allergy, clindamycin plus pyrimethamine could be considered, though less common.\n\n-Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex: In patients with CD4+ count <50 cells/mm3 like this individual, an antibiotic such as azithromycin once weekly would be the recommended prophylaxis.\n\n-Prophylaxis against fungal infections like Candida: Fluconazole may be indicated in specific situations such as prior history of severe oropharyngeal candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis, or if there are signs or symptoms suggestive of invasive candidiasis. However, in this case, without any reported or evident fungal infection, routine prophylaxis against Candida is not warranted.\n\n-Prophylaxis against CMV: CMV prophylaxis is generally not recommended, unless there's clear evidence of CMV end-organ disease or severe immunosuppression and lab markers of active CMV infection. Our patient's clinical presentation doesn't suggest those conditions. \n\nIt's noteworthy that, besides antimicrobial prophylaxis, this patient's adherence to his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) must be reinforced as it remains crucial to his health. A multidisciplinary treatment plan that includes psychological support for managing depression is vital to ensuring consistent medication adherence.\n\nIn summary, given this 33-year-old HIV-positive male patient's CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3 after six months of non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy, his prophylactic regimen should include TMP-SMX for protection against P. jiroveci and Toxoplasma gondii, and weekly azithromycin for MAC prevention. Additionally, he should receive counseling and mental health support for his depression to improve adherence to ART moving forward.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\nThis is a case of bacillary angiomatosis, an opportunistic infection caused by Bartonella henselae, typically seen in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria (B. henselae) on Warthin-Starry stain confirms the diagnosis. The recommended treatment includes antibiotics that target B. hensel, such as ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Additionally, considering her severe immunosuppression and risk of concurrent opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is warranted.\nOption A (Doxycycline) would be effective against B. henselae, but the addition of azithromycin in this case offers broader coverage for potential coinfections (e.g., Mycoplasma, Chlamydia). Furthermore, doxycycline does not address the need for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, unlike trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\nOption C (Erythromycin) has been used in bacillary angiomatosis, but its efficacy might be lower than the combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\nOption D (Atovaquone) is primarily indicated for P. jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis or treatment but would not cover B. henselae.\nOption E (Flucytosine) is an antifungal drug used in specific fungal infections and not relevant in this case.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? Which medications contribute to this risk?\nThe patient is at greatest risk for hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and fat redistribution (lipodystrophy) syndrome (also known as protease inhibitor-associated lipodystrophy). Indinavir is a protease inhibitor and the main contributor to this risk. Although long-term treatment with any of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can contribute, particularly stavudine (d4T), and zidovudine (AZT) can cause lipoatrophy, indinavir is the significant contributor to this risk profile in this patient. So, the correct answer is indinavir.  1\nNote: Protease inhibitors and some NRTIs are associated with metabolic changes, including hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and changes in body fat distribution. Indinavir, in particular, has been linked to dyslipidemia and the lipodystrophy syndrome. These side effects are important to consider when prescribing HIV treatment regimens. \n\n1:  Gerber JG.

    "answer": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis? A. Toxoplasmosis B. PML C. Lymphoma, primary central nervous system D. HIV-associated encephalopathy \nE. Cytomegalovirus meningoencephalitis\n\nAnswer: C. Lymphoma, primary central nervous system\n\nExplanation: This patient's presenting symptoms and recent MRI findings suggest a focal brain lesion. Given the patient\u2019s history of HIV, a solitary ring-enhancing lesion localized in the corpus callosum with Epstein-Barr virus DNA detected in cerebrospinal fluid points toward primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSLs are aggressive malignancies that predominantly occur in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is consistent with this diagnosis because EBV is known to play a causative role in these lymphomas, most likely through its oncogenic potential in B lymphocytes under conditions of immunosuppression.\nToxoplasmosis (A) is unlikely given the single lesion and the specific localization in the corpus callosum. Typically, toxoplasma encephalitis presents with multiple lesions which are hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI images and are not confined to a particular region like the corpus callosum.\nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (B) is improbable because, despite the patient\u2019s immunocompromised state, it typically presents as multifocal white matter lesions, often with a \"scalloped\" or \"fingerprint\" pattern of demyelination, as opposed to a solitary enhancing mass.\nHIV-associated encephalopathy (D) is ruled out because it usually presents with diffuse, symmetrical changes rather than a focal lesion, and does not demonstrate enhancement with contrast on MRI.\nCytomegalovirus meningoencephalitis (E) would more likely cause global cerebral edema, basal ganglia involvement, or periventricular enhancement, rather than a solitary enhancing mass lesion in the corpus callosum. Moreover, CMV rarely forms space-occupying lesions in HIV patients. \n\nThis assessment is based on radiographic findings, clinical presentation, and laboratory data, with special consideration given to the patient's HIV status. A definitive diagnosis could be achieved with a brain biopsy, but based on our information, primary CNS lymphoma remains the most plausible diagnosis.\ufffd",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",

Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant? \n\na) Initiate zidovudine to infants born to women with HIV with a viral load <1000 copies/mL\n\nb) Initiate intravenous zidovudine and three-drug combination therapy in infants born to women with a viral load >1000 copies/mL\n\nc) Initiate triple antiretroviral therapy to infants born to women with HIV\n\nd) Perform HIV PCR testing at birth, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 months\n\ne) Delay bathing by 8 hours to assess for maternal antibody transmission\n\n**Answer: a) Initiate zidovudine to infants born to women with HIV with a viral load <1000 copies/mL**\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for newborns of mothers with HIV, regardless of the viral load.\n* For mothers with a viral load <1000 copies/mL, such as in this case, infant PEP typically consists of zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy. This significantly reduces the risk of perinatal transmission.\n* Options b and c, which involve more complex antiretroviral regimens, are not necessary given the mother's controlled viral load and are not supported by current guidelines.\n* Option d, while mentioning important diagnostic testing, does not address the immediate postnatal management of this infant.\n* Option e is unrelated to HIV management; delayed bathing may be considered for general newborn care but does not pertain specifically to HIV transmission or prevention.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on guidelines from reputable sources like the CDC and AAP for managing HIV-exposed newborns. The most current information as of October 2021 aligns with the answer provided above. However, always verify with the latest guidelines or consult with an expert in pediatric infectious diseases if needed.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
