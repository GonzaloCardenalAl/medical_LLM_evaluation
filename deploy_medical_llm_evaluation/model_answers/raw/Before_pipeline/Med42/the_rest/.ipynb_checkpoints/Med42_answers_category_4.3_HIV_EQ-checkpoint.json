    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",

Hydrocortisone\nB. Intrathecal methotrexate\nC. Folinic acid \nD. Mannitol\n\nAnswer: D. Mannitol\n\nExplanation: The patient likely suffers from Cryptococcal meningitis based on the clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings. Mannitol is often considered a key intervention in patients with elevated opening pressure during lumbar puncture or clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in order to reduce the central nervous system (CNS) pressure. Folinic acid is often used to reduce the toxicity of flucytosine but does not impact management of elevated ICP. Hydrocortisone is often withheld in patients with active CNS infections due to potential adverse effects on immune function and worsening of clinical outcomes. Intrathecal methotrexate has no role in management of acute cryptococcal meningitis. So, the correct answer is D. Mannitol. ",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test? \n\nA) 0.976\nB) 0.98\nC) 0.995\nD) 0.999\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. You first need to construct a 2x2 contingency table summarizing the performance of the novel screening test to calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV). \n\nBy knowing the following information from the question, we can complete the table:\n\n- 250 patients with confirmed AIDS\n- 240 patients with AIDS tested positive (True Positives - TP) on the novel screening examination\n- 5 patients without AIDS tested positive (False Positives - FP) on the novel screening examination\n\nFrom this, we can infer 10 patients with AIDS tested negative (False Negatives - FN; 250 - 240), and 245 patients without AIDS tested negative (True Negatives - TN; 250 - 5).\n\nThe formula for Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is TN / (TN + FN). Here that's 245 true negatives (patients without AIDS testing negative) divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives (245 + 10). This simplifies to NPV = 245/255 \u2248 0.9608. However, none of the given options matches this exactly, but the closest answer is not provided (it's below 0.98); if we had to choose, the closest approximation from the given options would be 'A' (0.976), although it's an overestimation.\n\nThis highlights the need for precise calculations in medical statistics rather than relying solely on provided options. The actual NPV differs notably from the given choices, which indicates potential design issues in the question itself. As a result, neither of the given options (B, C, or D) should be selected over the closer value (A), even though it's still not exact. Ideally, the answer choice should allow for inclusion of an actual calculation, and in the case of this question, none of the answers correctly represent the NPV.  If you were forced to pick, use 'A', but remember it's an approximation rather than an exact NPV.  The given data doesn't support the other options (B, C or D).    ",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Thrombectomy or tPA if within the window\nE. Perform an ECG and initiate statin therapy\n\nThe correct answer to the question is: B. Urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine\n\nHere's why:\n- The patient's presentation, primarily the acute, progressive right hand weakness, localized to distal muscles, in the context of HIV and possible suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy, suggests a high likelihood of a CNS pathology like spinal cord disease over peripheral neuropathy or stroke (though stroke remains on the differential). The preserved sensation argues against a peripheral etiology or mononeuropathy but does not rule out nerve root or cord compression.\n- Given high fever and immunocompromised status, an infectious etiology such as an epidural abscess or discitis/OJI (osteomyelitis/infective discitis) must be entertained. An urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine would be the next step in investigating these possibilities, providing better detail of soft tissue and vertebral anatomy than CT scans.\n- Immediate angiography (A) would be inappropriate because the clinical presentation does not fit a typical arterial ischemic stroke; peripheral weakness, fever, and lack of cranial nerve involvement point away from an occlusive stroke, and toward CNS infection or inflammation.\n- CT angiogram of the head and neck (C) is not the best choice due to its lower sensitivity for spinal cord pathology and infectious processes compared to MRI. However, it could be used as an initial test if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, but that's not the scenario here.\n- Thrombectomy or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), choice D, would not be indicated here as the clinical presentation does not fit typical ischemic stroke criteria (e.g., sudden, not progressive, deficits that respect vascular territories). The patient is also outside common tPA time windows due to a morning event and late ED presentation.\n- ECG and initiating statin therapy (E) would be inappropriate given the current neurological symptoms. Although the patient has a family history of cardiac events (father) and cerebrovascular events (mother), these findings are not acutely relevant to his hand weakness and fever.\n\nHence, an urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine (B) is the best next step to investigate likely CNS involvement (",

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications.

An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis? \nA. Toxoplasmosis\nB. HIV-associated dementia\nC. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\nD. Central nervous system lymphoma\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. Answer C. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)PML is a demyelinating disorder caused by the JC polyomavirus, which infects oligodendrocytes and causes cell death. It occurs when severe immunosuppression (CD4 + count < 100 cells/\u03bcL) is present as a result of HIV infection, chemotherapy, or pharmacological immunosuppression. It presents as a slowly progressive decline in cognitive and motor functions, seizures, and ataxia. MRI shows multifocal white matter lesions that do not enhance after gadolinium injection. Diagnosis is made by identification of JC virus DNA in CSF by PCR testing or rarely by brain biopsy. There is no effective therapy, but immune reconstitution is crucial. So, the correct answer is: c. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  1. Toxoplasmosis is unlikely because the radiological findings in this disease are usually characterized by multiple ring-enhancing lesions. IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in this case indicate past exposure but do not confirm active toxoplasmosis.2. HIV-associated dementia typically presents with gradual cognitive decline over months or years in advanced HIV.3. Central nervous system lymphoma typically causes focal neurological deficits and enhancing mass lesions in the brain. So, the correct answer is: c. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  1. Toxoplasmosis is unlikely because the radiological findings in this disease are usually characterized by multiple ring-enhancing lesions. IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in this case indicate past exposure but do not confirm active toxoplasmosis.2.

She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit? So, let's think about this step-by-step. Ans-C a. Urinalysis - routine urinalysis is done in the initial visit of prenatal care. - it's important to assess for asymptomatic bacteriuria. b. Blood type, antibody screen - all the pregnant women should be known about their blood group and typed forRh and K 1 (Kell) antigens to decrease the chances or complications arising from hemolytic disease of the newborn. In Rh-negative unsensitized women, anti-D immune globulin should be offered between 24 and 30 weeks' gestation and after delivery if the newborn is Rh-positive. c Chlamydia trachomatis screening - screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should be performed in pregnant women in accordance with CDC guidelines. d Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening - HBV infection can manifest in a variety of forms and is associated with significant maternal morbidity as well as with chronic hepatitis in the baby if transmission is vertical. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) should be performed at the first prenatal visit regardless of her previous negative HBV test. e HIV screening - screening for HIV should follow the opt-out method where the patient is informed that testing will be done unless she declines. This should be done for all pregnant women. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 3. Maternal Anatomy. In F.G. Cunningham, K.J. Leveno, S.L. Bloom, J.C. Hauth, D.J. Rouse, C.Y. Spong (Eds), Williams Obstetrics, 23e. So, the correct answer is: c. Hepatitis C antibody screen (HBV screening is done, not HCV) So, let's think about this step-by-step. Screening for Hepatitis A, C, or E antibodies is not recommended for pregnant women who have no recognized risk factors such as multiple sexual partners, illicit drug use, or a history of blood transfusion prior to 1992. If this patient was born after 1992, her mother might have been vaccinated against Hepatitis A and B (if she traveled to a high-risk area). Hepatitis E is transmitted through fecal-oral contamination, and there is no vaccine available for Hepatitis E as of date. So, hepatitis C antibody testing is not mandatory in a routine",

Isoniazid\n\nThe correct answer for this biomedical question is: D. TMP-SMX\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. For an immunocompromised patient with a severely low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), preventing opportunistic infections is crucial. TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is commonly used as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in patients with severely compromised immune systems, particularly in HIV-positive individuals with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3. Therefore, TMP-SMX should be added to this patient's treatment regimen, alongside reinstated anti-retroviral therapy and appropriate care for his depression.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Voriconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used for invasive aspergillosis and some resistant candida infections. While immunocompromised patients are susceptible to fungal infections, voriconazole specifically targets different pathogens than PJP.\nB. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily targeting Candida species, sometimes used for prophylaxis against candidiasis in HIV patients with severe immunosuppression. However, it doesn't cover other opportunistic infections like PJP.\nC. Vancomycin is an antibiotic effective against gram-positive bacteria, such as MRSA, but it's not indicated for prophylaxis in HIV+ patients with low CD4+ counts.\nE. Isoniazid is used for tuberculosis prophylaxis or treatment but doesn't address PJP or other opportunistic infections specific to severely immunosuppressed HIV+ patients. \n\nAlways remember that HIV+ patients with low CD4+ counts need thorough prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in addition to their antiretroviral therapy (ART)\u2014TMP-SMX covers PJP, a life-threatening infection that can occur at this level of immunosuppression.",

Ciprofloxacin\nE. Metronidazole \n\nThe correct answer to this biomedical question is: A. TMP/SMX \nLet's think about this step-by-step. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low because of uncontrolled HIV infection. She has AIDS (stage 3 HIV infection). The presence of a fever and skin lesions leads to a diagnosis of disseminated bacillary angiomatosis (BA) due to infection with B. henselae. The skin biopsy shows bacteria and vascular proliferation in the papule, which is diagnostic. Treatment requires trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which will cure the lesion and prevent further dissemination. The patient likely acquired infection from a cat through a scratch. However, this would not be considered a zoonotic disease since the patient's immune system is already compromised. The white patches found on the palate (oral hairy leukoplakia) are caused by Epstein-Barr virus in the setting of HIV infection, but require no treatment unless symptoms such as dysphagia or pain appear. This also supports the fact that she likely has progressed to AIDS since this is not a common finding in HIV infected individuals who are not immunocompromised. The other antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole are not indicated for disseminated Bacillary angiomatosis. So, the correct answer is: a.

Indinavir can cause nephrolithiasis due to its low solubility in urine, which leads to the formation of crystals that can precipitate in the kidneys, causing renal stones. It is metabolized by the liver, but it does not typically cause ALT elevations or hepatoxicity. A common side effect of indinavir is lipodystrophy, also known as redistribution syndrome, which is characterized by subcutaneous fat loss from the extremities, face, or buttocks, and increased fat deposition in the abdomen, back, or breasts. Additionally, indinavir has been linked to metabolic changes, such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia (dyslipidemia). Neither zidovudine (a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor) nor lamivudine contributes significantly to these side effects. Zidovudine can cause bone marrow toxicity (anemia or neutropenia) and megaloblastic anemia, while lamivudine's side effects are generally mild. Pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy are side effects associated with didanosine (a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor) rather than indinavir. Increased indirect bilirubin is more commonly seen with atazanavir (another protease inhibitor).\n\nKey teaching point: Protease inhibitors, such as indinavir, are associated with nephrolithiasis, lipodystrophy, and metabolic changes like hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, like zidovudine and lamivudine, have different side effect profiles. Familiarizing yourself with medication-specific adverse effects is essential in clinical practice.",

Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis? And what is the likely underlying cause of this condition in this patient?\nThe right answer for this medical question is: The likely diagnosis here is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is one of the most common brain tumors in HIV/AIDS patients. PCNSL is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a very poor prognosis, characterized histologically by a diffuse, angiocentric pattern. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid strongly supports this diagnosis, as almost all cases of PCNSL in AIDS patients contain Epstein-Barr virus in their tumor cells. The fact that the patient has not maintained good adherence to antiretroviral therapy prior to this episode likely contributed to his HIV disease progression, resulting in immunosuppression and enabling the development of PCNSL. Toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are ruled out based on the MRI findings, which shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum rather than multiple areas of hyperintensity for PML or hypermetabolic foci on positron emission tomography (PET) scan for toxoplasmosis.

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant? \n\nA. Initiate zidovudine and lamivudine for 6 weeks\nB. Initiate nevirapine without any other antiretroviral medications\nC. Initiate zidovudine for 6 weeks with consideration of 2-3 more antiretroviral drugs based on maternal viral load\nD. Deferral of antiretroviral therapy until HIV status is confirmed\nE. Initiate triple combination antiretroviral therapy\n\nAnswer: C. Initiate zidovudine for 6 weeks with consideration of 2-3 more antiretroviral drugs based on maternal viral load\n\nExplanation: The child of an HIV-infected mother should receive antiretroviral prophylaxis as early as possible, preferably within 6-12 hours of birth. The recommended regimen includes zidovudine given for 6 weeks at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 6 hours. For women with a detectable viral load (>50-100 copies/mL), additional antiretroviral drugs may be considered to further reduce the risk of transmission. In this case, the mother's viral load was 678 copies/mL, making it reasonable to consider adding 2-3 more antiretroviral drugs based on the risk assessment.\n\nNevirapine alone (Option B) is not sufficient prophylaxis for this baby, given the mother's detectable viral load and the risk of resistance. Deferring antiretroviral therapy until HIV status is confirmed (Option D) is not recommended as prompt initiation of prophylaxis is crucial in preventing transmission. Initiating triple combination antiretroviral therapy like treating an HIV-infected individual (Option E) is excessive and not recommended for prophylaxis, as it may lead to toxicity and unnecessary exposure to multiple drugs. Zidovudine and lamivudine for 6 weeks without considering additional drugs based on maternal viral load (Option A) might not be sufficient protection against transmission given the mother's detectable viral load.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option C, initiating zidovudine for 6 weeks with consideration of adding 2-3 more antiretroviral drugs based on the maternal viral load to optimize prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
