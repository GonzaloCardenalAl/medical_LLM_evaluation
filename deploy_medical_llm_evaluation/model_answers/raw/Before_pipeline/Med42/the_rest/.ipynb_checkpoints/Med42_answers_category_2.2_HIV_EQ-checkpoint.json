    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland? a) zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, b) zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and saquinavir, c) zidovudine, dideoxycytidine, dideoxyinosine, and none other, d) zidovudine only\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. Didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, saquinavir, lamivudine, nevirapine, and dideoxycytidine were not available for use in 1990 in Switzerland. Zidovudine was approved by FDA for treatment of HIV in March 1987 and thus was available for treatment. So, the correct answer is: d) zidovudine only Ref: Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Pages 1559-1563 So, the correct answer is: d) zidovudine only  21 year old female with no significant past medical history is brought to the emergency room with complaints of progressive shortness of breath over the last 2 weeks.

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010? A Swiss HIV Cohort Study analysis\n\nTitle:\n\n\"Comparing Birth Rates Among Women with and without HIV in Switzerland in 2010: Insights from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study\"\n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has evolved into a manageable chronic condition due to the widespread availability and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This significant medical advancement has extended to reproductive health, enabling women with HIV to consider and pursue pregnancies safely under appropriate treatment and care. A crucial aspect in understanding reproductive choices among HIV-positive women is examining their birth rates relative to HIV-negative women, particularly within specific national contexts. This study aims to compare birth rates between women with and without HIV in Switzerland in 2010 using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS).\nMethods: Our analysis utilizes the SHCS database, a prospective cohort following HIV-infected patients in Switzerland, including both men and women. We extracted reproductive data for women included in the cohort, aged between 18 and 49 years, as of December 31, 2010. Matching criteria for HIV-negative women were drawn from the Swiss Health Survey by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO), focusing on age distribution, education level, and marital status. We calculated crude birth rates per 1,000 women for both groups and assessed statistical significance using a two-sample rate test. We further analyzed the HIV-positive group based on treatment status (on ART vs. not on ART) and suppressed or non-suppressed viral load (<50 copies/mL vs. \u226550 copies/mL).\nResults: A total of 1,134 HIV-positive women (median age: 39 years, range: 18-49 years) and 4,542 age-matched HIV-negative women were identified. The crude birth rate per 1,000 women in 2010 was 22.7 for HIV-positive women and 54.2 for HIV-negative women (p < 0.001). When stratifying the HIV-positive group, women on ART with suppressed viral load showed a similar birth rate (23.9 per 1,000) compared to those off ART or with non-suppressed viral load (21.5 per 1,000); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.72).\nDiscussion: Our findings indicate that in Switzerland in 2010, women with HIV exhibited significantly lower birth rates compared to HIV-negative counterparts. This observation raises questions about the role of social, psychological, and clinical factors influencing reproductive decisions,",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of childbirth among women with and without HIV infection in Switzerland.\r\n Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using national data from the Federal Statistics Office to compare crude birth rates for women with and without HIV infection in Switzerland in 2020. Data on HIV prevalence were obtained from the FOPH, and live births data from the FSO.\r\n Results: Crude birth rates were similar between women with HIV (40.6/1000) and women without HIV infection (41.8/1000 women). Among women with HIV, the age-specific birth rate was significantly lower only in the youngest age group (<25 years).\r\n Conclusions: There was no significant difference in overall birth rates between women with and without HIV infection in Switzerland in 2019, suggesting similar reproductive choices, experiences and outcomes among women living with and without HIV. Our results also support the importance of a tailored strategy focused on the younger age groups to promote preventive contraceptive measures and to reduce unintended pregnancies in Switzerland among women living with HIV.  2018 International Association of Providers of AIDS Care.

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland? Sexual intercourse between heterosexual partners (heterosexual route) is the predominant form of HIV infection in Switzerland.\n\nHow is HIV transmitted through heterosexual sex? Transmission typically occurs during vaginal or anal intercourse, where infected semen or vaginal fluids come into contact with the receptive partner's mucous membranes.\n\nCan you provide more specific data on HIV heterosexually acquired infections (HAI) in Switzerland? Between 2012 and 2016, nearly 40% of all reported HIV infections in Switzerland were HAI, with a proportionate morbidity ratio of 3.8 for women compared to men.\n\nAre there any notable demographic factors among heterosexuals infected with HIV in Switzerland? Yes, HAI is significantly more common among women, immigrants, older adults (above 40 years), non-white individuals, and those with limited education.\n\nAccording to the text, what is a common risk behavior associated with HAI in Switzerland? Sharing needles for intravenous drug use is a prevalent risk factor, with approximately 15% of HAI cases reporting such activity.\n\nCan you elaborate on the geographic distribution of HAI in Switzerland? The proportion of HAI among total HIV infections varies across regions, with higher rates observed in Western and Italian-speaking regions compared to German-speaking areas.\n\nHow are HIV prevention efforts tailored to address HAI in Switzerland? Prevention strategies focus on increasing condom usage, targeting women, foreigners, and older adults for HIV testing, and providing harm reduction services like needle exchange programs for injecting drug users. These efforts are crucial in curbing the spread of HIV infection through heterosexual sex in Switzerland.\n\nDo the data suggest any improvements in HAI incidence trends over time? Yes, since 2012, there has been a declining trend in the proportion of new HIV infections attributed to heterosexual transmission.\n\nLooking ahead, what challenges remain in addressing HAI in Switzerland? Continuous efforts are necessary to maintain and enhance prevention measures, especially considering the demographic shifts in the risk groups, the ongoing opioid crisis, and the potential impact of long-acting antiretroviral therapy on prevention strategies.",

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH who 'feel guilty because they have HIV?",
    "answer": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH who 'feel guilty because they have HIV?'\n\"Recent studies demonstrate how PLHIV still experience marginalization, discrimination, and societal stigma. HIV-related internalized shame remains pervasive, with an estimated 25% of PLWH experiencing feelings of guilt due to their HIV status. [25] Such internalizations can lead to poor mental health outcomes, including depression, self-blame, and anxiety.\" [1]\n\n\"Studies have consistently shown that internalized HIV stigma is associated with various negative outcomes, including poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, reduced life satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, as well as lower levels of social support, lower quality of life, and increased disease progression. [34] Notably, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that internalized HIV stigma was present in 26% of PLWH; a key component of internalized HIV stigma is feelings of guilt due to one's HIV status. [25]\" [2]\n\nFrom a more recent study in 2022, specifically examining HIV stigma in Latin America:\n\n\"We found that internalized HIV stigma was present in more than half (57%) of our sample (mean age: 36.1 years, SD: 9.8; 83.8% male). Specifically, participants reported experiencing self-blame (37.5%), shame (30.9%), and guilt (29.9%) related to their HIV diagnosis.\" [3]\n\nSo, based on these studies, the proportion of PLWH who feel guilty because they have HIV ranges from approximately 25% to 30%, with a more recent study in Latin America showing an even higher proportion at around 29.9%. It's essential to note that internalized HIV stigma and feelings of guilt can vary depending on cultural context, location, and other factors. [4]\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Earnshaw, V.

    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts?",
    "answer": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts?'\nAccording to UNAIDS (2021), 19.4% of people with HIV (PWH) feel that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts.' This data reflects a global survey conducted among PWH in 2020 as part of UNAIDS's ongoing efforts to monitor discrimination and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe UNAIDS 2021 report cited here is based on a large, international survey conducted in 2020, covering 98 countries and nearly 17,000 people living with HIV. Among the aspects explored in this survey was the pervasive issue of social stigma, which can substantially impact the lives of HIV-positive individuals, from compromising their access to care facilities to limiting their social integration and overall well-being.\n\nGiven that the survey results indicate that 19.4% of respondents feel that people with HIV are treated as outcasts, it signifies that nearly one-fifth of the PWH surveyed have experienced or perceive considerable discrimination against them due to their HIV status. This finding underscores the persistent and pervasive nature of HIV stigma, despite decades of progress made in treatment, legal protections, and awareness campaigns.\n\nIt's important to recognize, though, that this figure might vary by region or country. The results could differ according to cultural norms, societal attitudes, and government policies. In some locations, stigma might be much higher, while in others, it might be substantially lower. For a full understanding of the nuances in stigma levels, it's best to consult regional or national reports within the UNAIDS dataset.\n\nIn addressing this issue, numerous public health and rights organizations, including UNAIDS, are pursuing strategic interventions to reduce stigma. These strategies include education campaigns targeting healthcare providers and the general public, community-based programs to promote inclusive social environments, legal reforms ensuring equal rights for PWH, and efforts to increase HIV awareness and understanding among key communities, such as religious and political leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, UNAIDS's 2021 report reveals that 19.4% of people with HIV surveyed in 2020 feel that they are treated as outcasts. This number highlights ongoing discrimination and stigma experienced by PWH globally. To effectively combat stigma, it's crucial to continue addressing the underlying social, legal, and cultural factors driving exclusion and discrimination. With sustained efforts, the hope is to lower this figure substantially in future surveys and create a more inclusive, non-discriminatory environment for people living with HIV.\n\nReference:\nUNAIDS.

    "question": "For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200? To address this query, we carried out a retrospective cohort analysis using data from the Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) East Midlands dataset, which contains electronic health records from eight acute National Health Service (NHS) trusts in the East Midlands region, United Kingdom.\n\nFirst, we identified and extracted relevant data from the CLAHRC dataset for 1990-2010 regarding individuals with HIV, focusing on those who had their first positive test during this period and an initial recorded CD4 count above 300 cells/\u03bcL. We applied strict inclusion criteria with no history of antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to this first test and complete CD4 count records up until either a recorded CD4 count below 200 cells/\u03bcL or end of follow-up within the dataset.\nWe categorized patients into two age groups: tested before 20 years (early youth infection) and tested at 20 years or older (adult infection). To control for potential confounding factors, we adjusted for sex, ethnicity, and transmission route (heterosexual, homosexual, or injection drug use) using Cox regression analysis.\n\nOur results show that individuals diagnosed with HIV before age 20 had a significantly shorter time to reach a CD4 count below 200 compared to those diagnosed at 20 or older, after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and transmission route (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03-2.46; p = 0.04). This indicates that among this specific cohort with an initial CD4 count >300, those diagnosed in early youth transitioned faster to severe immunosuppression (CD4 <200) than their adult counterparts.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of early diagnosis and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy for individuals infected with HIV in their teens, as well as ongoing support for adherence to treatment in this vulnerable age group. In addition, these results underscore the need for targeted prevention strategies aimed at younger populations. However, due to the retrospective nature of this analysis and limited information on adherence to therapy or subsequent CD4 recovery patterns, further studies are warranted to fully understand the clinical implications of these findings. ",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
