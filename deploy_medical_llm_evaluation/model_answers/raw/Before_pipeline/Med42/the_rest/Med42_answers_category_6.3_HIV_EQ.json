What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? 1. Start IV methylprednisolone 2. Administer acetazolamide 3. Provide IV dexamethasone 4. Initiate antiseizure prophylaxis with phenytoin Answer: 4. Initiate antiseizure prophylaxis with phenytoin This patient has cryptococcal meningitis, evidenced by the presentation of headache, fever, and fatigue in an immunocompromised host (AIDS) with lumbar puncture findings of increased opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. Amphotericin B and flucytosine are appropriate treatments for this condition. Chloramphenicol, prescribed for another patient, is not indicated for cryptococcal meningitis. In the acute setting, antiseizure prophylaxis with phenytoin is necessary due to the risk of seizures associated with central nervous system infections like cryptococcal meningitis, especially in cases with increased intracranial pressure. Methylprednisolone, acetazolamide, and dexamethasone do not address seizure prevention; rather, they are used for different conditions or purposes. Methylprednisol would be considered for inflammatory or immune-mediated reactions, acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used for conditions like glaucoma or to prevent altitude sickness, and dexamethasone may be used in some CNS infections for edema reduction (e.g., brain abscess), but its role here is not primarily for seizure prophylaxis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",

Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test? (Note that sensitivity = TP)/(TP + FN) and specificity = TN/(TN + FP), where TP, TN, FP, and FN are true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively.\n\nA. 98%\nB. 49/250 = 0.196\nC. 245/250 = 0.98\nD. 5/10 = 0.5\n\nLet's break down the given information and calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) step by step:\n\n1. True Negatives (TN): This represents individuals without AIDS (the control group) who tested negative on the screening exam. Since 250 patients in the control group didn 't have AIDS, and only 5 of them tested positive (false positives), 250 - 5 = 245 patients are true negatives.\n2. False Negatives (FN): These are individuals with AIDS who tested negative on the screening exam. The problem states that 240 out of 250 AIDS patients tested positive, so 250 (total AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10 patients are false negatives.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula:\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nSubstitute the calculated values:\nNPV = 245 (true negatives) / (245 + 10)\n= 245 / 255\n\u2248 0.9608 (or 96.08%)\n\nChoose the closest option, which is not exactly provided in the choices (the answer options are not precise calculations), but based on approximation, we can select the closest one:\nA. 98% (this value slightly overestimates the NPV but is the nearest among the given options) is the best choice.\n\nB. 0.196, C. 0.98 (which is the specificity, not NPV), and D. 0.5 are all incorrect.",

The question's context relied on the hospital empirically using itraconazole for the past 10 years, which influences the answer, but in a real-world setting, voriconazole",

An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis? - The most likely diagnosis in this patient is HIV-associated dementia due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The clinical presentation includes subacute onset of neurological symptoms such as leg weakness, gait disturbances, cognitive decline characterized by forgetfulness, disorientation, difficulties with complex daily tasks, and mood changes with paranoia and agitation. The lack of enhancement on MRI and the diffuse white matter lesions without mass effect support the diagnosis of PML. Although HIV-associated dementia itself is possible given the patient's CD4+ count and HIV viral load, the specific imaging features are more consistent with PML. Vascular dementia would less likely present with such prominent white matter lesions on MRI, especially without any recent stroke or transient ischemic attack history.\nThis patient's combination of neurological symptoms, imaging findings, and HIV/AIDS status with severe immunosuppression makes HIV-associated PML the most likely diagnosis.\nHere are some additional points for consideration:\n1. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV), typically occurring in significantly immunocompromised individuals, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS, lymphoproliferative disorders, or on immunosuppressive medication for transplantation or autoimmune conditions.\n2. PML's clinical features usually include neurological deficits that develop gradually but progress steadily over weeks to months, such as motor weakness, cognitive impairment, visual abnormalities, or ataxia. The patient's clinical presentation with leg weakness, gait disturbances, forgetfulness, loss of orientation, and difficulties with complex tasks aligns with this pattern.\n3. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are classic for PML. Although these lesions can sometimes show faint enhancement in later stages of the disease, lack of enhancement is more common, especially early on. The absence of mass effect also distinguishes PML from brain abscesses, tumors, or stroke-related lesions, which would typically cause significant mass effect on imaging.\n4. Although HIV-associated dementia can manifest similarly to PML with cognitive impairment, neurological deficits, and mood disturbances, it would not typically result in such distinctive MRI findings. Usually, HIV-associated dementia's MRI appearance would consist of atrophy, with occasional subtle white matter changes that lack the distinct multifocal pattern seen in PML. Additionally, HIV-associated dementia's course is often slower and more variable than PML.\n5. The patient's low CD4+ count (56/",

In women who are asymptomatic and have no history of thyroid disease, thyroid function tests need not be undertaken with each pregnancy.\nThe risk of contracting cytomegalovirus (CMV) is greater for women of childbearing age who care for young children at home, women who work in day care centers, and those who are in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, testing for CMV serology is not recommended as part of routine prenatal care.\nPCR for HSV-2 has no role in asymptomatic pregnant women. However, asymptomatic women living in communities with a high incidence of HSV-2 seropositivity may have a vaginal culture for herpes simplex at 35-37 weeks gestation, to prevent transmission during delivery.\nThe ABO blood group can be assessed on each pregnant woman to detect at-risk Rh (D)-negative women who will require immune globulin prophylaxis.\nAll pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen.\nAlthough routine tests for immunity to varicella have been proposed, no recommendation is currently available. Nonetheless, a simple varicella skin test will quickly reveal immune status.\nUrinalysis is recommended to assess for proteinuria as a screen for diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, and urinary tract or kidney disease.\nScreening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is accomplished by urinalysis, and treatment significantly decreases the subsequent incidence of acute and chronic infections of the upper urinary tract. Such screening is considered essential.\nRubella serology is a routine determination, because postnatal immunization is imperative if the mother is seronegative.\nWomen are universally screened for TB using PPD or Quantiferon-TB Gold assay.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: a.

His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? 1. Itraconazole 2. Fluconazole 3. Foscamet 4. Ganciclovir 5. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole\n\nThe correct answer to this biomedical question is: 2. Fluconazole\n\nJustification: With a CD4+ count below 100 cells/mm3, patients with HIV/AIDS are at high risk for opportunistic infections. In this case, the patient's severely depressed immune status (CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3) increases his susceptibility to invasive fungal infections such as cryptococcal disease and candidiasis. Fluconazole, an antifungal azole, is often prescribed prophylactically in this setting to prevent these infections, particularly cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated candidiasis (1,2).\n\nWhile itraconazole (1) can also be used for fungal prophylaxis, its use would generally be considered second-line due to decreased bioavailability and compliance issues with oral capsules in immunocompromised patients (3). The other options are not specifically used for fungal prophylaxis in this context: Foscamet (3) is an antiviral, typically used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections; Ganciclovir (4) is also an antiviral, targeted against CMV, though not as a prophylactic for HIV patients with CD4+ below 100; and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (5) is an antibacterial combination used against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), not for fungal prophylaxis.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Pentamidine\nAnswer: C. TMP-SMX, with folinic acid supplementation. The patient likely has bacillary angiomatosis due to infection with Rochalimaea henselae (now known as Bartonella henselae), a gram-negative rod. This is typically a disease of immunocompromised individuals. Treatment should be initiated with erythromycin (500 mg PO or IV qid), azithromycin (250 mg PO or 500 mg IV once daily), or doxycycline (100 mg PO or IV bid). For the given scenario, TMP-SMX is an acceptable alternative choice due to familiarity with this antibiotic in the hospital. While B. henselae is not inherently susceptible to sulfonamides (it's primarily treated with macrolides or tetracyclines), TMP-SMX could be considered in an HIV-affected patient with CD4 < 200/mm3, given its crossover use for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis (especially in a resource-limited setting), provided sulfonamide sensitivity in B. henselae is confirmed or presumed locally. However, dapsone (B) is less effective against B. henselae, and pentamidine (E) is not indicated for bacillary angiomatosis. Clindamycin (A) is not recommended for this infection. Trimethoprim alone (D) without the sulfonamide partner does not provide adequate coverage against B. henselae. Additionally, folinic acid supplementation should be considered to prevent myelosuppression due to TMP-SMX in patients with HIV and low T-cell count. Lastly, addressing her substance abuse, smoking, and nutritional status would be important in her overall treatment plan. ",

    "answer": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nA. Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system\nB. Cerebral toxoplasmosis\nC. Cryptococcal meningitis\nD. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. This patient with HIV presents with a ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, and cerebrospinal fluid with Epstein-Barr virus DNA, suggesting a diagnosis of Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (A). Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system is an aggressive malignancy associated with HHV-8 and Epstein-Barr virus, commonly seen in patients with HIV or under immunosuppression from transplantation or chemotherapy. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (B) typically presents as multiple lesions in any brain region. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (D), lesions are diffusely distributed, predominantly in the white matter, and are not ring-enhancing. Cryptococcal meningitis (C) usually presents as non-enhancing lesions. In glioblastoma multiforme, lesions are variable in appearance and typically not associated with pleocytosis or EBV in the cerebrospinal fluid. So, the correct answer is: a. Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system ",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",

What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant? \n\nA. Administer prophylaxis to prevent perinatal HIV transmission\nB. Begin intravenous immunoglobulin therapy\nC. Do not prophylax, but instead closely monitor the newborn's HIV viral load over time\nD. Perform a baseline HIV PCR test and start antiretroviral therapy for presumed infection\n\nConsidering maternal HIV status with a detectable but suppressed viral load near delivery, and a term infant with no clinical signs of illness, the focus should be on prevention of vertical transmission rather than presumed infection or treatment based on immediate test results.\n\nOption A is the correct answer: The standard practice for infants born to HIV-positive mothers, regardless of maternal therapy adherence or viral load, is to administer prophylactic antiretroviral therapy to prevent perinatal transmission (1, 2). This has been endorsed by major organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States (3, 4). Common prophylactic regimens include zidovudine alone or combinations like zidovudine plus lamivudine, though specific drug choices and durations may vary depending on regional guidelines and the mother's antiretroviral therapy.\n\nOption B, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, has no evidence or role in preventing HIV transmission in the newborn and is incorrect in this context.\n\nOption C, monitoring the HIV viral load over time without prophylaxis, is not a recommended approach, as delaying treatment until infection is confirmed may decrease the effectiveness of preventing transmission and could also harm the infant if infection has occurred.\n\nOption D, performing a baseline HIV PCR test and starting antiretroviral therapy based on presumed infection, is not the standard approach for an asymptomatic term infant born to an HIV-positive woman. A baseline HIV PCR can help identify and track the infant's status, but prompt prophylaxis precedes such testing in this case.\n\nReferences:\n1. Mofenson LM.
