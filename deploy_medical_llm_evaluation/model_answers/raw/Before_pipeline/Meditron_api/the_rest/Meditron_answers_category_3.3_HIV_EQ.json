    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "The mother's doctor stressed not to overheat the formula to prevent the inactivation of Vitamin C, which is a heat-sensitive vitamin. If the formula is boiled for too long, the heat could denature the enzymes required for the metabolism of Vitamin C. Enzymes require a specific temperature range to function properly. If the temperature exceeds this range, the proteins in the enzymes can unfold, leading to their denaturation and loss of function. Therefore, the molecular process impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed could be the denaturation of enzymes due to overheating.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."
