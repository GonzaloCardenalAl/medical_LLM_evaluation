    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of headache, fever, fatigue, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings (increased opening pressure, lymphocytes, elevated protein, decreased glucose), along with her history of AIDS, the most likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis. Amphotericin B and flucytosine are appropriate initial treatments. However, given the elevated intracranial pressure, the patient may require therapeutic lumbar punctures for pressure relief. Additionally, dexamethasone may be considered to reduce intracranial pressure and inflammation, as it has been shown to improve outcomes in certain cases of severe cryptococcal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "## Calculating the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the Novel AIDS Screening Examination\n\n### Understanding NPV:\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a test is the probability that a patient with a negative test result actually does not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negative results divided by the total number of negative results.\n\n### Study Overview:\n- The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS and 250 patients without AIDS.\n- The novel screening examination was performed on all patients.\n\n### Key Findings:\n- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):** 240 / (240 + 250) = 240 / 490 \u2248 0.49 (or 49%)\n- **Specificity (True Negative Rate):** 245 / (245 + 5) = 245 / 250 \u2248 0.98 (or 98%)\n\n### Calculating NPV:\n- **True Negative Results:** 245\n- **Total Negative Results:** 245 + 5 = 250\n\n### NPV Formula:\nNPV = (True Negative Results) / (Total Negative Results)\nNPV = 245 / 250 \u2248 0.98 (or 98%)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 98%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation is concerning for a Coccidioidal meningitis, a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides that can affect the central nervous system. The patient's HIV status, history of pneumonia, and geographical location (the Southwest United States) are risk factors for this infection. The next best step in management is to obtain a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for Coccidioidal meningitis. If the LP reveals elevated protein and low glucose, the diagnosis can be confirmed with an antibody test. The patient should be started on empiric treatment with fluconazole, which is the first-line treatment for Coccidioidal meningitis. Itraconazole is not the first-line treatment for Coccidioidal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."
