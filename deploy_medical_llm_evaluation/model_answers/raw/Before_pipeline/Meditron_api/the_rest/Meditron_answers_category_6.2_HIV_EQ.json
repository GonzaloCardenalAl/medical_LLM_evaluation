    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and CSF findings are suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine is appropriate. However, given her severe headache and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), the patient may benefit from therapeutic lumbar puncture to reduce the ICP. This procedure involves removing excess cerebrospinal fluid to lower the ICP and alleviate the headache. It may need to be repeated if symptoms persist.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To determine the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the True Negatives (TN):** This is the number of patients in the control group who do not have AIDS and also tested negative on the screening examination. We know that 5 patients tested positive, so the number of patients who tested negative is 250 - 5 = 245.\n\n2. **Calculate the False Negatives (FN):** This is the number of patients in the study group who have confirmed AIDS but tested negative on the screening examination. We know that 240 patients tested positive, so the number of patients who tested negative is 250 - 240 = 10.\n\n3. **Calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV):** The NPV is calculated using the formula:\n\n   NPV = (TN) / (TN + FN)\n\n   Substituting the values we calculated:\n\n   NPV = (245) / (245 + 10)\n   NPV = 245 / 255\n   NPV = 0.96\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination is 96%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation of focal neurological deficits along with his immunocompromised status due to HIV infection and his recent hospitalization for pneumonia should raise suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection, most likely cerebral toxoplasmosis. Given his CD4 count of 77/mm^3, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. While itraconazole is an antifungal, it is not typically used for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Empiric treatment should be initiated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which are the first-line agents for cerebral toxoplasmosis. The patient should also undergo imaging studies such as MRI to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes such as a brain abscess or a primary brain tumor.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation suggests HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), particularly given his advanced HIV disease (CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL) and neuroimaging findings. HAND can manifest with a range of cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits, as seen in this patient. Vascular dementia, while also a possibility given his hypertension, is less likely given the imaging findings and his young age. Other diagnoses, such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis, are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen and positive Toxoplasma IgG, which suggests past exposure rather than active infection.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient has been recently prescribed a treatment with a known adverse effect of pancreatitis, which suggests that the treatment is likely a combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, commonly used for HIV management. The three medications mentioned - lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir - are all part of the ART regimen.\n\nGiven that the patient is already on ART and has a history of pancreatitis as an adverse effect, he is at greatest risk for developing metabolic complications, including:\n\n1. **Lipodystrophy**: This is a redistribution of body fat, leading to abnormal fat accumulation in some areas (such as the abdomen or back of the neck) and loss of fat in others (such as the face or limbs).\n\n2. **Dyslipidemia**: Elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides are common in patients on ART, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n3. **Insulin Resistance and Diabetes**: Some ART medications can lead to insulin resistance, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n4. **Lactic Acidosis**: This is a serious condition where lactic acid builds up in the blood, often associated with mitochondrial toxicity caused by certain ART medications.\n\n5. **Bone Loss and Osteoporosis**: Long-term use of certain ART medications can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporosis.\n\nThe patient's history of pancreatitis as an adverse effect from ART highlights the importance of closely monitoring and managing potential metabolic complications associated with ART therapy.",

He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's history of HIV, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and neurological symptoms, along with the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI and positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA on PCR, suggest a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the brain and is more common in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV. The symptoms of PCNSL can include headache, vertigo, personality changes, and cognitive impairment, as seen in this patient. The ring-enhancing lesion on MRI is characteristic of PCNSL, and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA supports this diagnosis.",
