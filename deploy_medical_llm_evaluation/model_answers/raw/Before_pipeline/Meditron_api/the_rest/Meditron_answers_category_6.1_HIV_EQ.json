    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "## Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in AIDS Patients\n\n### Background\nA 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents with severe pain, fatigue, progressively worsening headache, and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit, prompting her to seek care in the ED. The lumbar puncture results demonstrate an elevated opening pressure, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose, suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n### Initial Treatment\nThe emergency physician has initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which is the standard initial treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, considering the patient's severe symptoms and the potential for increased intracranial pressure (ICP), additional treatment may be warranted in the acute setting.\n\n### Additional Treatment in the Acute Setting\nIn patients with increased ICP, as indicated by the high opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, additional treatment with corticosteroids may be necessary to reduce ICP and alleviate symptoms. Specifically:\n\n*   **Corticosteroids**: May be administered to reduce inflammation and decrease ICP.\n*   **Lumbar Puncture**: May be repeated to monitor the decrease in ICP and to guide further management.\n\n### Important Considerations\nRecent studies have shown that corticosteroids can be beneficial in reducing ICP and alleviating symptoms in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, especially in those with increased ICP. However, the decision to administer corticosteroids should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's overall condition and the potential risks and benefits of treatment.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation of unilateral weakness and fever in the setting of HIV and immunosuppression should raise concern for a central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis. However, the preserved sensation and the gradual onset of symptoms are more suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as a brain abscess or CNS toxoplasmosis. CNS toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV and CD4 counts less than 100/mm^3. Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, the next step in management should be to obtain a CT scan of the head to evaluate for space-occupying lesions. Empiric treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which is the initial treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, should also be considered. Itraconazole is not the appropriate empiric treatment for this patient's presentation.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV infection, severe immunosuppression (indicated by a CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL), and MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated dementia (HAD). HAD is a complication of advanced HIV infection, characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms. The key features of HAD include:\n\n1. Cognitive symptoms: Memory loss, difficulty with concentration, and confusion.\n2. Motor symptoms: Unsteady gait, weakness, and poor coordination.\n3. Behavioral symptoms: Depression, apathy, and paranoia.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated white matter lesions without enhancement are typical of HAD. The absence of mass effect and the negative cryptococcal antigen further support this diagnosis. Although Toxoplasma gondii IgG is positive, it is not a common cause of dementia in HIV patients. \n\nVascular dementia is more commonly associated with a history of strokes or multiple small vessel disease, which is not suggested by the patient's history or imaging.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "This patient's CD4+ count has significantly decreased, indicating advanced HIV disease. His CD4+ cell count is less than 200 cells/mm3, suggesting that he is at a high risk for opportunistic infections. Given his depressed mood, he may also be susceptible to infections. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, but it is not typically prescribed for the prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV patients. \n\nInstead, the patient should be prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts. TMP-SMX can also provide protection against toxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections. In addition, if the patient's CD4+ count is below 50 cells/mm3, he should also be prescribed azithromycin or clarithromycin for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. \n\nIt is also important to address the patient's depression, which may be contributing to his non-adherence to his HIV medication regimen.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "This patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of a condition called bacillary angiomatosis, which is caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. This condition is more common in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe standard treatment for bacillary angiomatosis is Erythromycin, which is effective against Bartonella infections. However, the hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. These medications are typically used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, a different opportunistic infection that can occur in HIV patients with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n\nConsidering that the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis, and given the hospital's history of using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to discontinue these medications and start Erythromycin. \n\nAnswer:\nErythromycin",
