    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "## Antiretroviral Treatment in Switzerland (1990)\n\n### Background:\nIn the early 1990s, the treatment of HIV/AIDS was still in its infancy. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) marked a significant turning point in the management of the disease. Switzerland, like many other countries, adopted various antiretroviral medications to combat HIV.\n\n### Common Antiretroviral Drugs in 1990:\nThe following five antiretroviral drugs were the most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990:\n\n#### 1. **Zidovudine (AZT)**\n- A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that inhibits HIV replication.\n- Introduced in the late 1980s, it was one of the first antiretroviral medications available.\n\n#### 2. **Didanosine (Videx)**\n- An NRTI that interferes with HIV replication.\n- Approved in the late 1980s, it was used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.\n\n#### 3. **Zalcitabine (Hivid)**\n- An NRTI that inhibits HIV replication.\n- Introduced in the early 1990s, it was used to treat patients with advanced HIV disease.\n\n#### 4. **Stavudine (Zerit)**\n- An NRTI that inhibits HIV replication.\n- Approved in the early 1990s, it was used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.\n\n#### 5. **Lamivudine (Epivir)**\n- An NRTI that inhibits HIV replication.\n- Introduced in the mid-1990s, it became a cornerstone of HIV treatment regimens.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe use of these antiretroviral medications in 1990 marked the beginning of a new era in HIV treatment. While these medications have largely been replaced by more effective and safer alternatives, they played a crucial role in the early management of HIV/AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."
