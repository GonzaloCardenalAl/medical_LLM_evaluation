    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation is indicative of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and CD4 counts less than 100. The elevated opening pressure is concerning for increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to complications such as cerebral edema, herniation, and death. Therefore, in addition to antifungal treatment, this patient may also benefit from serial daily lumbar punctures to relieve the increased intracranial pressure.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "## Calculating the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a Novel AIDS Screening Examination\n\n### Understanding NPV:\nNPV is a measure of the probability that a patient with a negative test result actually does not have the disease. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\nNPV = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\n### Given Data:\n\n- **True Positives (TP):** 240 patients with confirmed AIDS tested positive on the screening examination.\n- **False Positives (FP):** 5 patients without AIDS tested positive on the screening examination.\n- **True Negatives (TN):** 245 patients without AIDS tested negative on the screening examination.\n- **False Negatives (FN):** 10 patients with confirmed AIDS tested negative on the screening examination.\n\n### Calculating NPV:\n\n1. Identify the number of True Negatives (TN) and False Negatives (FN).\n2. Calculate the NPV using the formula: NPV = (TN) / (TN + FN)\n3. Substitute the given values into the formula: NPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\n4. Perform the calculation: NPV = 245 / 255\n5. Simplify the result: NPV = 0.96\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe negative predictive value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination is 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this screening examination, there is a 96% chance that they actually do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation of sudden onset weakness in one extremity is concerning for an acute stroke. The patient's fever, low CD4 count, and history of inconsistent HIV medication adherence raise the possibility of a central nervous system infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis. However, given the focal nature of the weakness and the absence of other symptoms (e.g., headache, altered mental status), an ischemic stroke should still be considered. The next best step would be to obtain neuroimaging (e.g., CT or MRI) to evaluate for stroke or other intracranial pathology. Other diagnostic steps may include a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis if an infection is suspected, as well as tests for other potential causes such as electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "### Patient Presentation\n\nA 44-year-old man presents with a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. He has also been experiencing cognitive decline, including forgetfulness and difficulty operating simple appliances, over the past 6 months. His mental status has deteriorated, with increased paranoia, agitation, and restlessness. His medical history includes HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and he has been noncompliant with his medications.\n\n### Vital Signs and Physical Examination\n\n* Temperature: 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F)\n* Blood pressure: 152/68 mm Hg\n* Pulse: 98/min\n* Respirations: 14/min\n* Neurological examination: Right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits\n* Mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas\n\n### Laboratory Findings\n\n* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL\n* Leukocyte count: 3600/mm^3\n* Platelet count: 140,000/mm^3\n* CD4+ count: 56/\u03bcL\n* HIV viral load: > 100,000 copies/mL\n* Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive\n\n### Imaging Findings\n\n* MRI of the brain: Disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are most suggestive of **HIV-associated dementia (HAD)**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nHIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a common complication of untreated HIV infection, particularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression. The pathophysiology of HAD is complex and involves both direct and indirect effects of the virus on the central nervous system.\n\n* **Direct effects**: HIV infection can lead to neuronal damage and death through various mechanisms, including the release of neurotoxic viral proteins and the activation of immune cells.\n* **Indirect effects**: HIV infection can also lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier and promote the entry of toxic substances into the brain.\n\nThe symptoms of HAD can vary widely, but common features include cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and behavioral changes. The patient's presentation of cognitive decline, motor dysfunction (right leg weakness), and behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation, and restlessness) is consistent with HAD.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are also characteristic of HAD. These lesions are thought to represent areas of demyelination and axonal damage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated dementia (HAD).",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
