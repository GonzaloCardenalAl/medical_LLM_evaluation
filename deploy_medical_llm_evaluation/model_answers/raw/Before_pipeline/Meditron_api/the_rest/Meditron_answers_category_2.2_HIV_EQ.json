    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "## Antiretroviral Therapy in Switzerland (1990)\n\n Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has undergone significant advancements since its inception. In the early 1990s, the primary goal of ART was to manage HIV symptoms and slow disease progression. Understanding the antiretroviral drugs used during this period provides valuable insights into the evolution of HIV treatment.\n\n ### Key Factors:\n - **Era of Monotherapy**: In the early 1990s, antiretroviral therapy primarily consisted of monotherapy, where a single drug was administered to manage HIV symptoms.\n - **Limited Treatment Options**: The limited availability of antiretroviral drugs during this period restricted treatment options for HIV patients.\n\n ### Most Frequently Administered Antiretroviral Drugs in Switzerland (1990):\n The following five antiretroviral drugs were most commonly used in Switzerland in 1990:\n\n 1. **Zidovudine (AZT)**: A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was widely used as a first-line treatment for HIV.\n 2. **Didanosine (ddI)**: Another NRTI that was often prescribed in conjunction with AZT to manage HIV symptoms.\n 3. **Zalcitabine (ddC)**: A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was used to treat HIV, often in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.\n 4. **Stavudine (d4T)**: A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was commonly used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to manage HIV.\n 5. **Lamivudine (3TC)**: A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was often prescribed in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV.\n\n These five antiretroviral drugs played a crucial role in managing HIV symptoms in the early 1990s, laying the foundation for the development of more effective combination therapies.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "## Birth Rate Comparison in Switzerland: Women with and without HIV in 2010\n\n### Study Overview:\n\nA study conducted in Switzerland in 2010 aimed to compare the overall birth rate among women with and without HIV. This comparison is essential in understanding the reproductive health and outcomes of women living with HIV.\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n*   **Birth Rate Among Women with HIV:**\n    *   2.9 births per 100 person-years\n*   **Birth Rate Among Women without HIV:**\n    *   3.3 births per 100 person-years\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the study found a slight difference in birth rates between women with and without HIV, the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.23). This suggests that women living with HIV in Switzerland in 2010 had a similar reproductive potential as those without HIV.",
