Zidovudine (ZDV)**\n - **2. Didanosine (ddI)**\n - **3. Zalcitabine (ddC)**\n - **4. Stavudine (d4T)**\n - **5. Lamivudine (3TC)**\n\n These drugs were used individually or in combination to manage HIV infection, although the efficacy and side effects of these early treatments were limited compared to modern ART regimens.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."
