    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In Switzerland, the most common source of HIV infection is through sexual contact. This includes both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Other significant sources include intravenous drug use and, to a lesser extent, mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. It's important to note that public health campaigns and prevention strategies, such as safe sex practices and needle exchange programs, play a crucial role in reducing the transmission of HIV in the country.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "answer": "In 2020, 1 in 5 PLWH (people living with HIV) reported feeling guilty because they have HIV. This means that 20% of PLWH experienced guilt related to their HIV status.",

    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts?",
    "answer": "In 2020, 37% of people with HIV (PWH) believed that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'. This perception highlights the ongoing stigma and discrimination faced by individuals living with HIV, despite efforts to educate the public and promote understanding. Stigma can significantly impact the mental health and well-being of PWH, as well as their willingness to seek treatment and support. Addressing these attitudes is crucial for improving the lives of those affected by HIV.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

    "question": "For individuals who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To determine if there is a difference in the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between people living with HIV (PWH) who were tested before or after the age of 20, we can consider several factors that may influence CD4 count decline.\n\n1. **Age at Diagnosis**: Generally, younger individuals may have a more robust immune system compared to older individuals. Those tested after the age of 20 may have had a longer period of HIV infection before diagnosis, which could lead to a more significant decline in CD4 counts.\n\n2. **Time of Diagnosis**: The availability and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved over the years. PWH diagnosed after 2010 would have had access to more advanced treatments compared to those diagnosed in the early 1990s. This could lead to better management of the virus and slower CD4 decline.\n\n3. **Initial CD4 Count**: While both groups had an initial CD4 count above 300, the specific level of that count could vary. Higher initial counts may provide a buffer against rapid decline.\n\n4. **Individual Health and Lifestyle**: Factors such as overall health, adherence to treatment, and lifestyle choices can significantly impact the rate of CD4 decline.\n\n5. **Access to Healthcare**: Those diagnosed after 2010 may have had better access to healthcare and HIV management programs, which could influence the rate of CD4 decline.\n\nGiven these factors, it is likely that PWH tested after the age of 20 may experience a slower decline in CD4 counts compared to those tested before 20, assuming they have access to effective treatment and care. However, without specific data or a study comparing these two groups, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. A statistical analysis of a cohort study would be necessary to draw conclusions about the differences in CD4 decline rates based on age at diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
