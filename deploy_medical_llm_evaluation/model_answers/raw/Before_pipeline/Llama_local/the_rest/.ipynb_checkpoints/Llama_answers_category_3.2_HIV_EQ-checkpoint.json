    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results are most consistent with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain and/or eyes. It is more common in individuals with immunocompromised states, such as those with HIV/AIDS, particularly when the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, as detected by PCR, supports this diagnosis, as EBV is often associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients. The MRI findings of a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum are also characteristic of PCNSL. \nThe best answer is D.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "A) Oxidation\nB) Hydrolysis\nC) Denaturation\nD) Hydrogenation\nE) Denitrification\nThe question requires the test-taker to evaluate the consequences of boiling the formula longer than needed and understand the molecular process that could be impaired as a result. The correct answer, denaturation, is a process that occurs when proteins are exposed to high temperatures, causing them to unwind and lose their functional shape. This is relevant to the scenario because boiling the formula could denature the proteins present, including enzymes, which could affect the nutritional value of the formula. The other options are incorrect because oxidation is a process that involves the loss of electrons, hydrolysis is a process that involves the breakdown of molecules using water, hydrogenation is a process that involves the addition of hydrogen to a molecule, and denitrification is a process that involves the removal of nitrogen from a molecule, none of which are directly related to the scenario described. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to think critically about the consequences of a specific action (boiling the formula longer than needed) and evaluate the potential effects on the molecular structure of the formula. This is an example of Consequence Evaluation, as the test-taker needs to consider the potential outcomes of a specific action and choose the most appropriate answer based on that analysis.\nThe best answer is C",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the context of the patient's condition\nThe patient is a 35-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with HIV and has been started on combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. She recently developed acute pancreatitis.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the potential cause of acute pancreatitis in this context\nDidanosine is known to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition. The development of acute pancreatitis in this patient shortly after starting the cART regimen suggests that didanosine might be the causative agent.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the necessary precautions or changes in medication\nGiven the association between didanosine and pancreatitis, it would be prudent to avoid the use of didanosine in this patient to prevent recurrence of pancreatitis. This means that an alternative antiretroviral medication should be selected to replace didanosine in her treatment regimen.\n\n## Step 4: Consider alternative antiretroviral medications\nThere are several alternative nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and other classes of antiretroviral drugs that could be used in place of didanosine, depending on the patient's viral load, resistance profile, and other factors. The choice of alternative medication would be made in consultation with an HIV specialist.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Didanosine should be replaced with an alternative antiretroviral medication to prevent recurrence of pancreatitis.}$",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "A) gp120\nB) gp41\nC) gp160\nD) HIV protease\nThe question asks for the most likely target of a new antibody against HIV envelope proteins. The natural humoral immune response produces antibodies against HIV envelope proteins, so the new antibody should target the same proteins. \nA) gp120 is an HIV envelope protein, and is a likely target of the antibody.\nB) gp41 is also an HIV envelope protein, and is a likely target of the antibody.\nC) gp160 is a precursor to gp120 and gp41, and is not as likely a target as the final products gp120 and gp41.\nD) HIV protease is an enzyme that is not part of the HIV envelope, and is not a target of the natural humoral immune response. \nBoth A and B are likely targets, but the question asks for the most likely target. gp120 is on the surface of the virus and is the protein that the virus uses to bind to CD4 cells, making it a more accessible target for antibodies than gp41, which is embedded in the viral envelope. \nThe correct answer is A.\nThe best answer is A.",

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "Are there any differences in methylation profiles between these two groups?\nDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In the context of HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral replication and latency. Studies have shown that DNA methylation patterns differ between individuals with latent HIV-1 infection and those with active infection.\nIn individuals with latent HIV-1 infection, the viral genome is methylated, which contributes to the suppression of viral transcription and replication. Specifically, the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region, which is essential for viral transcription, is heavily methylated in latently infected cells. This methylation is thought to prevent the binding of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thereby silencing viral gene expression.\n\nIn contrast, individuals with active HIV-1 infection exhibit reduced methylation of the HIV-1 LTR region, allowing for the activation of viral transcription and replication. Additionally, active infection is associated with changes in the methylation status of host genes involved in immune response and inflammation, which can contribute to the progression of the disease.\n\nComparative studies have identified distinct DNA methylation profiles between latently infected and actively infected individuals. For example, a study published in the journal PLOS Pathogens found that latently infected individuals had increased methylation of the HIV-1 LTR region and decreased methylation of host genes involved in immune response, whereas actively infected individuals had decreased methylation of the LTR region and increased methylation of host genes involved in inflammation.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Epigenetics found that the methylation status of specific host genes, such as the CD4 gene, differed between latently infected and actively infected individuals. The CD4 gene, which encodes the primary receptor for HIV-1 entry, was found to be hypermethylated in latently infected individuals, suggesting that epigenetic regulation of this gene may contribute to the maintenance of latency.\n\nOverall, the existing evidence suggests that DNA methylation plays a critical role in regulating HIV-1 latency and replication, and that distinct methylation profiles are associated with latent and active infection. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these differences and to explore the potential of epigenetic therapies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. \n\nReferences:\n\n* Blazkova et al.
