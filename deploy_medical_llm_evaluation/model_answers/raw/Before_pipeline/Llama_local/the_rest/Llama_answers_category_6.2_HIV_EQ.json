    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "What is the likely diagnosis?\n## Step 1: Identify the likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and test results.\nThe patient's symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue, and the results from the lumbar puncture (increased opening pressure, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose) suggest an infection of the central nervous system, specifically meningitis. Given the patient's immunocompromised state (AIDS with a CD4 count of 47), the likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the treatment initiated and its implications.\nThe emergency physician has initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which is a standard treatment regimen for cryptococcal meningitis. This combination is effective against Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungus responsible for this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the relevance of the previous patient's treatment with Chloramphenicol.\nChloramphenicol is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections and is not typically used for fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis. Its mention in the context of a patient with similar symptoms suggests that the previous patient might have had a different diagnosis, possibly bacterial meningitis, which would require a different treatment approach.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the additional treatment warranted in the acute setting for the current patient.\nGiven the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis and the treatment already initiated (IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine), additional treatment in the acute setting may include measures to manage increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which is a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis. This can involve repeated lumbar punctures to relieve pressure, as well as the administration of corticosteroids in some cases to reduce inflammation. Monitoring for and managing potential side effects of amphotericin B, such as nephrotoxicity, is also crucial.\n\n## Step 5: Confirm the likely diagnosis and summarize the appropriate treatment approach.\nThe likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, given the patient's immunocompromised state and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis results. The appropriate treatment approach includes antifungal therapy with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, along with management of increased ICP and monitoring for treatment side effects.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Cryptococcal meningitis}$",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "What is the NPV of this test if the prevalence of AIDS is 0.01?\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) is given by the formula: PPV = TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.\nIn this case, the PPV would be 240 / (240 + 5) = 240 / 245.\nHowever, the question asks for the negative predictive value (NPV), which is given by the formula: NPV = TN / (TN + FN), where TN is the number of true negatives and FN is the number of false negatives.\nTo calculate the NPV, we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). From the problem, we know that there are 250 patients without AIDS, and 5 of them tested positive (FP). Therefore, the number of true negatives (TN) is 250 - 5 = 245.\nWe are not directly given the number of false negatives (FN), but we can calculate it using the information about the patients with confirmed AIDS. There are 250 patients with AIDS, and 240 of them tested positive. Therefore, the number of false negatives (FN) is 250 - 240 = 10.\nNow, we can calculate the NPV: NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255.\nIf the prevalence of AIDS is 0.01, we need to adjust the calculation of NPV accordingly. The prevalence of AIDS is the proportion of the population that actually has the disease. In this case, the prevalence is 0.01, which means that 1% of the population has AIDS.\nLet's assume a population of 1000 for simplicity. With a prevalence of 0.01, there would be 10 people with AIDS (0.01 * 1000) and 990 people without AIDS.\nUsing the same test characteristics (240 true positives out of 250 actual AIDS cases, and 5 false positives out of 250 non-AIDS cases), we can estimate the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives in this population.\nTrue positives = 10 * (240/250) = 9.6 (approximately)\nFalse negatives = 10 - 9.6 = 0.4 (approximately)\nTrue negatives = 990 * (245/250) = 970.2 (approximately)\nFalse positives = 990 * (5/250) = 19.8 (approximately)\nNow, we can calculate the NPV in this population: NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 970.2 / (970.2 + 0.4) = 970.2 / 970.6 \u2248 0.999. \n\nThe final answer is 245/255, 0.999.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation with sudden weakness of one hand, fever, and a history of immunocompromised state (HIV with low CD4 count) suggests a possible diagnosis of focal neurological infection, such as a brain abscess or a focal neurological infection due to an opportunistic pathogen. Given the patient's immunocompromised status and the fact that the hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole, which is an antifungal agent, the next best step in management would be to start empiric antifungal therapy while awaiting further diagnostic workup. \nThe patient should undergo imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI of the brain, to evaluate for focal neurological lesions. Additionally, a lumbar puncture should be considered to evaluate for CNS infection, although this should be done with caution in the setting of potential space-occupying lesions. The patient's empiric antifungal therapy should be guided by local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns, and itraconazole may be a reasonable choice given the hospital's experience with this medication. However, other antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B or voriconazole, may also be considered depending on the specific clinical scenario and local guidelines. \nIt is also important to note that the patient's inconsistent adherence to his HIV medications may have contributed to his current immunocompromised state, and efforts should be made to optimize his HIV treatment regimen and improve his adherence. \nIn summary, the next best step in management for this patient would be to start empiric antifungal therapy, preferably with itraconazole given the hospital's experience with this medication, while awaiting further diagnostic workup, including imaging studies and potentially a lumbar puncture. \nThe best answer is C. \nNote: The other options are not correct because: \nA) Starting empiric antibacterial therapy without considering antifungal coverage may not be sufficient given the patient's immunocompromised state and the possibility of opportunistic fungal infections. \nB) Starting empiric antiviral therapy without further diagnostic workup may not be necessary, as the patient's presentation does not strongly suggest a viral etiology. \nD) Delaying treatment until diagnostic workup is complete may not be appropriate given the patient's acute presentation and the potential for rapid progression of focal neurological infections. \nE) Starting treatment with ibuprofen alone may not be sufficient, as the patient's presentation suggests a more serious underlying condition that requires more aggressive management. \nThe best answer is C. \nThis question requires the test-taker to synthesize information from the patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory results to develop a differential diagnosis and management plan. The correct answer requires consideration of the patient's immunocompromised state, the possibility of opportunistic infections, and the need for empiric antifungal therapy while awaiting further diagnostic workup. The incorrect options require the test-taker to recognize the limitations of each choice and the potential consequences of delaying or inappropriate treatment. \nThis question assesses the test-taker's ability to: \n1. Synthesize information from multiple sources to develop a differential diagnosis \n2. Recognize the importance of empiric antifungal therapy in immunocompromised patients \n3. Consider the potential consequences of delaying or inappropriate treatment \n4. Evaluate the patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory results to guide management decisions. \nThe best answer is C. \nThis question requires the test-taker to apply knowledge of infectious diseases, neurology, and pharmacology to a complex clinical scenario. The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of empiric antifungal therapy in immunocompromised patients and the need for prompt diagnostic workup to guide management decisions.

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and patient history.\nThe patient presents with a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, forgetfulness, difficulty with familiar routes, and problems operating simple appliances. He also exhibits paranoia, agitation, and restlessness. His medical history includes HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a significantly low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the laboratory and imaging findings.\nLaboratory studies reveal anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and a very low CD4+ count with a high HIV viral load. The MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect. The patient is also Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive, indicating past exposure to Toxoplasma.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the differential diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and findings.\nGiven the patient's HIV status, low CD4+ count, and neurological symptoms, several diagnoses could be considered, including opportunistic infections (such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), and vascular dementia. However, the presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI without mass effect and the patient's immunocompromised state are critical for narrowing down the diagnosis.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of each potential diagnosis.\n- **Toxoplasmosis** typically presents with enhancing lesions on MRI due to the inflammatory response, which does not match the nonenhancing lesions seen in this patient.\n- **Cryptococcal meningitis** can cause neurological symptoms, but the negative cryptococcal antigen makes this less likely.\n- **Vascular dementia** is less likely given the patient's age and the specific pattern of white matter lesions on MRI, which are not typical for vascular dementia.\n- **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** is a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which reacts with the patient's immune system, particularly in those with weakened immune systems like HIV/AIDS patients. It presents with subacute onset of focal neurological deficits and characteristic nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, matching the patient's presentation.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the most likely diagnosis based on the analysis.\nGiven the patient's immunocompromised state, the subacute onset of neurological symptoms, and the characteristic MRI findings of nonenhancing white matter lesions, the most likely diagnosis is **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)}$",

She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Determine the routine prenatal tests recommended for all pregnant women.\nRoutine prenatal tests include a complete blood count (CBC), blood type and Rh factor, urinalysis, urine culture, hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV testing, syphilis testing, and rubella immunity status. Additionally, screening for gestational diabetes and anemia is typically performed.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the patient's specific situation and history.\nGiven that the patient has no personal or family history of serious illness, her vaccinations are up-to-date, and she takes no medications, the focus remains on standard prenatal screening tests. Her previous negative tests for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are noted, but these would typically be re-screened during pregnancy due to the potential for new exposures.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the hospital's specific testing protocols.\nThe hospital's protocols include testing for Serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), CMV (cytomegalovirus) serology, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus type 2). These tests are not universally recommended for all pregnant women but are part of this hospital's protocol.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the necessity of each test based on current guidelines and the patient's risk factors.\n- Serum TSH is recommended for all pregnant women to screen for thyroid dysfunction, which is common in pregnancy and can affect both mother and fetus.\n- CMV serology is not routinely recommended for all pregnant women but may be considered in certain high-risk situations or if the patient requests it.\n- PCR for HSV-2 is not a routine prenatal test but may be considered for women with a history of genital herpes or those whose partners have genital herpes.\n\n## Step 5: Compile the list of tests to be performed based on the steps above.\nGiven the information and the hospital's protocols, the patient should undergo:\n- Routine prenatal tests (CBC, blood type and Rh factor, urinalysis, urine culture, hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV testing, syphilis testing, and rubella immunity status).\n- Serum TSH as per the hospital's protocol and because thyroid screening is recommended in pregnancy.\n- Re-screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae due to the potential for new exposures since her last test.\n- CMV serology and PCR for HSV-2 as per the hospital's protocol, although these are not universally recommended.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Serum TSH, CMV serology, PCR for HSV-2, CBC, blood type and Rh factor, urinalysis, urine culture, hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV testing, syphilis testing, rubella immunity status, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae screening}$",

When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "The patient should be prescribed Fluconazole for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. \n\nGiven the patient's CD4+ count is below 100 cells/mm3, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is commonly prescribed for prophylaxis against fungal infections, specifically cryptococcal meningitis and esophageal candidiasis, in patients with low CD4+ counts. \n\nIn addition to Fluconazole, the patient should also be prescribed Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Toxoplasmosis. This is because patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3 are at increased risk for these opportunistic infections. \n\nThe patient should also be prescribed Isoniazid (INH) for prophylaxis against latent tuberculosis (TB) if he has a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test or if he has been exposed to someone with active TB. \n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's depression should also be addressed, and he should be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment.

The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the brain, particularly involving the corpus callosum, is consistent with PCNSL. The patient's history of HIV infection and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count also increase the risk for PCNSL. The detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid by PCR supports this diagnosis, as EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients. While glioblastoma can also present with a ring-enhancing lesion, the clinical context and laboratory findings in this case are more suggestive of PCNSL.\nThe best answer is C.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "A) Administer zidovudine\nB) Administer lamivudine\nC) Administer nevirapine\nD) Administer HAART\nE) HIV DNA PCR\nF) HIV viral load\nG) Administer HAART and HIV DNA PCR\nAnswer: A\nThe most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to administer zidovudine (also known as AZT), which is a common antiretroviral medication used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV when the mother's viral load is not well controlled, as in this case where the viral load is 678 copies/mL close to delivery. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other guidelines recommend administering zidovudine to the newborn within 6-12 hours after birth when the mother has a detectable viral load near the time of delivery, to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. \nWhile lamivudine and nevirapine are also antiretroviral medications, the initial step in this scenario, given the provided options and the context of preventing mother-to-child transmission, is to administer zidovudine. HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) may be considered later based on the infant's HIV status and other factors. HIV DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a diagnostic test used to detect the presence of HIV in infants, but it is not the immediate next step in management; rather, it would be part of the diagnostic workup to confirm the infant's HIV status after birth. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer zidovudine to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the newborn. \nThe best answer is A.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
