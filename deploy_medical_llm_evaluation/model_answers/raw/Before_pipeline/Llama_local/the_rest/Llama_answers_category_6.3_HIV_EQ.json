    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "What are the symptoms and what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n## Step 1: Identify the symptoms and lab results\nThe patient presents with severe pain, fatigue, progressively worse headache, and fever. The lumbar puncture results show an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the most likely diagnosis\nGiven the patient's symptoms and lab results, particularly the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings from the lumbar puncture, the most likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis. This condition is common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, and the CSF findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the treatment initiated\nThe emergency physician has initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which is the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the additional treatment warranted\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has been started on appropriate antifungal therapy, additional treatment in the acute setting may include management of the increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and supportive care for her symptoms. The mention of a similar patient being prescribed Chloramphenicol is a red herring since Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic and not typically used for fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the specific additional treatment for increased ICP\nFor the management of increased ICP, as indicated by the high opening pressure on lumbar puncture, repeated lumbar punctures may be performed to relieve pressure. Additionally, other measures such as elevating the head of the bed, mannitol, or other interventions to reduce ICP may be considered.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Cryptococcal meningitis}$",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP) from the given data.\nThe number of true positives (TP) is 240, as 240 patients with confirmed AIDS tested positive on the screening examination. The number of false positives (FP) is 5, as 5 patients without AIDS tested positive on the screening examination.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) from the given data.\nThe number of true negatives (TN) can be calculated by subtracting the number of false positives from the total number of patients without AIDS. So, TN = 250 - 5 = 245. The number of false negatives (FN) can be calculated by subtracting the number of true positives from the total number of patients with AIDS. So, FN = 250 - 240 = 10.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) using the formula NPV = TN / (TN + FN).\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic to find the NPV.\nNPV = 245 / 255.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.\nNPV = 245 / 255 = 49 / 51.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.96}$",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests a focal neurological deficit, which could be indicative of a central nervous system (CNS) infection or a stroke. Given his history of HIV with a low CD4 count, he is at risk for opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings, particularly the sudden onset of weakness in one hand, are more suggestive of a stroke.\n\nThe patient's temperature is elevated, which could indicate an infectious process, but it could also be a response to the stroke itself. The use of empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years in the hospital suggests a protocol for treating suspected fungal infections, which are common in immunocompromised patients like this one. However, the primary concern based on the patient's presentation should be to investigate and manage the cause of his neurological deficit, which appears to be a stroke.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient would be to perform imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis of a stroke and to rule out other causes of his neurological deficit, such as a mass lesion or an infection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain would be appropriate initial steps. Additionally, given the patient's history of HIV and potential for opportunistic infections, further diagnostic workup may include lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated by imaging findings), blood cultures, and possibly empirical treatment for common opportunistic infections while awaiting diagnostic results.\n\nFurthermore, considering the patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART), it is crucial to assess his current viral load and CD4 count to understand the status of his HIV infection better. This information can guide the management of his HIV and the approach to potential opportunistic infections.\n\nIn summary, while the patient's presentation and history suggest a complex differential diagnosis, the immediate next step should focus on diagnosing the cause of his neurological deficit, with a high suspicion for a stroke, and managing his condition accordingly, which may include neuroimaging, potential anticoagulation or thrombolysis if a stroke is confirmed and depending on the timing and type, and addressing his underlying HIV infection and potential for opportunistic infections. \nThe best answer is C.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Identify the key clinical features and history provided in the scenario.\nThe patient presents with a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, and a 6-month history of forgetfulness, getting lost in familiar routes, difficulties with operating simple appliances, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness. He has a history of HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has been noncompliant with his medications.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the relevance of the patient's medical history, including HIV status and noncompliance with medications.\nThe patient's HIV status, with a CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL and a high viral load, indicates severe immunocompromise. This makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections and other complications associated with advanced HIV disease.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the laboratory findings and their implications.\nLaboratory studies show anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL), leukopenia (Leukocyte count 3600/mm3), thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 140,000/mm3), and a very low CD4+ count, indicating advanced HIV disease. The presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies suggests past exposure to Toxoplasma, but the negative Cryptococcal antigen makes cryptococcal infection less likely.\n\n## Step 4: Interpret the MRI findings in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results.\nThe MRI shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect. This finding, in combination with the patient's immunocompromised state and neurological symptoms, is suggestive of a specific diagnosis related to HIV.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the differential diagnoses based on the patient's presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results.\nGiven the patient's severe immunocompromise, neurological symptoms, and MRI findings, the differential diagnoses could include opportunistic infections (e.g., progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and other conditions such as vascular dementia. However, the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, in the context of advanced HIV disease, strongly points towards a specific diagnosis.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the most likely diagnosis based on the synthesis of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.\nConsidering the patient's severe immunocompromise, the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, and the clinical presentation of progressive neurological decline, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus that affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. It leads to the destruction of the myelin sheath covering nerve cells in the brain, resulting in symptoms like weakness, vision loss, and cognitive decline.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)}$",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Initial Prenatal Visit Tests\nAt the initial prenatal visit, several tests are standard to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. These typically include a complete blood count (CBC), blood type and Rh factor, rubella immunity, hepatitis B surface antigen, and a urinalysis. Additionally, screening for gestational diabetes, HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is recommended for all pregnant women.\n\n## Step 2: Consideration of Patient's History and Current Guidelines\nGiven the patient's age, nulliparity, and lack of personal or family history of serious illness, the focus will be on standard prenatal screening tests. Since her vaccinations are up-to-date and she has no history of substance use, specific screenings related to those areas are not necessary unless otherwise indicated by current guidelines or symptoms. The patient's previous negative tests for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are noted, but current guidelines recommend re-screening for these infections during pregnancy if the patient is at risk or if it has been a certain period since the last test.\n\n## Step 3: Hospital-Specific Tests\nThe hospital's practice of testing Serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is in line with recommendations for pregnant women to screen for thyroid dysfunction, as it can affect both mother and fetus. CMV (cytomegalovirus) serology is not universally recommended for all pregnant women but may be considered based on risk factors or symptoms. PCR for HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus type 2) is not a routine test for all pregnant women unless there's a history of genital herpes or symptoms suggestive of an outbreak.\n\n## Step 4: Determining Necessary Tests\nGiven the patient's presentation and the information provided:\n- Standard prenatal tests should be performed, including CBC, blood type and Rh factor, rubella immunity, hepatitis B surface antigen, and urinalysis.\n- Screening for gestational diabetes, HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be considered based on current guidelines and risk factors.\n- Serum TSH should be tested as per hospital protocol to assess thyroid function.\n- CMV serology and PCR for HSV-2 are not universally recommended for all pregnant women but could be considered based on specific risk factors or symptoms, which are not indicated in this patient.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Panel}$",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "1) Fluconazole, 2) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 3) Isoniazid, and 4) Valacyclovir?\n\n## Step 1: Identify the patient's condition and the implications of his low CD4+ count.\nThe patient is HIV-positive with a significantly low CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm^3, indicating a compromised immune system. This makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the common opportunistic infections in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts.\nPatients with low CD4+ counts are at risk for various opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and tuberculosis, among others.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the role of each medication listed in preventing or treating opportunistic infections in HIV patients.\n1) Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to prevent and treat fungal infections such as cryptococcosis.\n2) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic used to prevent PCP, a common and potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts.\n3) Isoniazid is an antibiotic used for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB), which is also an opportunistic infection in HIV patients.\n4) Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, which can be more severe in immunocompromised patients.\n\n## Step 4: Based on the patient's condition and the common practice for preventing opportunistic infections in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts, select the appropriate medication(s).\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count, he is at risk for several opportunistic infections. The most critical preventive measure would be against PCP, given its high mortality rate if untreated. While Fluconazole is often prescribed for patients with HIV for fungal infections, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is specifically recommended for PCP prophylaxis in patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm^3. Isoniazid is considered for TB prophylaxis if the patient has latent TB infection. Valacyclovir may be considered for patients with a history of HSV infections.\n\n## Step 5: Select the medication(s) that should be taken in addition to anti-retroviral therapy based on standard HIV care guidelines.\nThe patient should take Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP prophylaxis, given his low CD4+ count. Fluconazole may be considered if there's a specific indication for fungal infection prophylaxis, but it's not universally recommended for all patients with low CD4+ counts. Isoniazid should be considered if the patient has latent TB. Valacyclovir would be indicated if the patient has a history of HSV infections requiring suppressive therapy.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$</code></pre>",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "The patient has a history of sulfa allergy.\n\nThe patient's presentation is suggestive of bacillary angiomatosis (BA), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which is characterized by the presence of vascular proliferations and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Given the patient's history of sulfa allergy, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be Azithromycin, which is effective against Bartonella species and is a suitable alternative to the traditional treatment with erythromycin or doxycyclin. \n\nThe best answer is Azithromycin. \n\nNote: The use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not appropriate for the treatment of bacillary angiomatosis, as these medications are typically used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Additionally, the patient's history of sulfa allergy would preclude the use of sulfadiazine. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to analyze the patient's presentation, laboratory results, and medical history to determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy, while also considering potential contraindications and alternative treatments. This requires the ability to evaluate scientific evidence, weigh the pros and cons of different treatment options, and make a informed decision based on the patient's specific needs.\nThe best answer is Azithromycin.",

Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "What is the most likely cause of this adverse effect?\n## Step 1: Identify the medications prescribed to the patient\nThe patient is being treated with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir for HIV.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the adverse effect mentioned\nThe adverse effect mentioned is pancreatitis.\n\n## Step 3: Identify which medication is most likely to cause pancreatitis\nAmong the medications listed (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), didanosine and stavudine are well-known to cause pancreatitis, but they are not listed here. However, lamivudine and zidovudine can also have this side effect, although it is less common compared to didanosine and stavudine. Indinavir is more commonly associated with nephrolithiasis and hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the risk for pancreatitis with the given medications\nGiven the medications, the patient is at risk for pancreatitis, but the risk is more commonly associated with other medications not listed here. However, among the choices given, lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and while they can cause pancreatitis, it's less common compared to other NRTIs like didanosine.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the most likely cause of pancreatitis among the given options\nSince didanosine and stavudine are not listed but are well-known for causing pancreatitis, and considering the medications the patient is on (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), if pancreatitis were to occur, it would be less likely due to these specific medications compared to other NRTIs. However, the question implies a recent prescription had pancreatitis as an adverse effect, suggesting we are looking for a medication known for this side effect.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the question for the most likely medication causing pancreatitis\nGiven the context that the question implies a recent prescription had pancreatitis as an adverse effect and considering common antiretroviral medications associated with pancreatitis, didanosine is a well-known culprit but is not listed. Among the options provided (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), none are as strongly associated with pancreatitis as didanosine or stavudine. However, the question's framing suggests looking for a medication that could cause pancreatitis among those recently prescribed or considered in the context of HIV treatment.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the broader context of HIV treatment and pancreatitis risk\nIn the broader context of HIV treatment, certain medications are more commonly associated with pancreatitis. The question hints at a recent prescription causing pancreatitis, which might imply a medication not listed but commonly known for this side effect in the context of HIV treatment.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Pancreatitis}$",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain and/or spinal cord. It is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, are also consistent with PCNSL. The MRI findings of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum are also typical of PCNSL. In contrast, glioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor that arises from glial cells, and while it can present with similar symptoms, it is not typically associated with EBV infection or a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, PCNSL is the most likely diagnosis.\nThe best answer is C.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "A) Administer zidovudine for 4 weeks\nB) Administer zidovudine for 6 weeks\nC) Administer zidovudine and lamivudine for 4 weeks\nD) Administer zidovudine and nevirapine for 4 weeks\nE) Administer zidovudine for 4 weeks and perform a HIV DNA PCR at 14-21 days of life\nF) Administer zidovudine for 6 weeks and perform a HIV DNA PCR at 14-21 days of life\nAnswer: E\nExplanation: The most appropriate next step in management is to administer zidovudine to the infant for 4 weeks and perform a HIV DNA PCR at 14-21 days of life. This approach is based on guidelines for the management of infants born to HIV-positive mothers. Zidovudine (also known as AZT) is an antiretroviral medication that is used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Administering zidovudine to the newborn for 4 weeks is a standard protocol when the mother's viral load is not well controlled, as indicated by a viral load of 678 copies/mL. Additionally, performing a HIV DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test at 14-21 days of life is recommended to diagnose HIV infection in the infant early. This test directly detects the genetic material of the virus and can provide a diagnosis before antibodies to HIV are detectable. The other options either do not include the diagnostic testing necessary for early detection of HIV in the infant or suggest different antiretroviral regimens and durations that are not the most appropriate initial steps based on current guidelines. Therefore, the best answer is E. \nThe best answer is E.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
