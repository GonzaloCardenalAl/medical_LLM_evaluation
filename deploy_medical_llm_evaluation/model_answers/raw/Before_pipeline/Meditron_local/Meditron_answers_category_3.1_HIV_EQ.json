    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "### Answer:\nHIV Encephalitis\n\n### Explanation:\nThe patient has primary central nervous system lymphoma, also called AIDS-related lymphoma, which is the most common central nervous system malignancy in HIV-infected individuals. AIDS-related lymphoma is a complication of HIV infection, typically seen in patients with CD4 counts less than 100/\u03bcL. AIDS-related lymphoma is thought to be triggered by Epstein-Barr virus. It is treated with antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy.\n\nHIV encephalitis is a diagnosis of exclusion and would require a brain biopsy to confirm. Other conditions such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a central nervous system infection caused by reactivation of JC virus, and primary central nervous system lymphoma should be ruled out first. Treatment is with antiretroviral therapy to improve immune function.\n\nCerebral toxoplasmosis is a common cause of brain lesions in immunocompromised patients. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan that typically infects the brain, lungs, liver, and heart. The cerebral lesions associated with toxoplasmosis are typically hypodense on CT scans and are more often multiple and centrally located. The lesions typically show ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT scans and are usually surrounded by edema. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a mild mononuclear pleocytosis with normal glucose levels and slightly elevated protein levels. Treatment is with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine.\n\nCryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. In immunocompromised patients, cryptococcal infection can lead to severe pneumonia and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common central nervous system infection in HIV-infected individuals and is typically associated with CD4 counts less than 100/\u03bcL. Cryptococcal meningitis usually presents as a chronic, subacute process of fever, headache, lethargy, and confusion. Treatment is with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole.\n\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma is a B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised patients. It is a complication of HIV infection, typically seen in patients with CD4 counts less than 100/\u03bcL. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is thought to be triggered by Epstein-Barr virus. MRI findings are suggestive",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The answer is Enfuvirtide.\n\n# Introduction\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health concern affecting nearly 1.1 million Americans (2015 statistics, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of HIV transmission, pathogenesis, and therapy, while focusing on the viral targets of current antiretroviral drugs.\n\n## Life Cycle and Mechanisms of Action\nHIV is a single-stranded, positive sense, retroviral RNA virus belonging to the lentivirus family. It contains nine genes; gag, pol, and env are the three main genes of HIV. The gag gene is translated into core proteins and is essential for the viral life cycle. Pol encodes essential viral enzymes and the env gene encodes the viral envelope glycoproteins. The core proteins of the HIV virion include Gag, which is cleaved into p17, p24, and p15. The major structural protein of the virion is the p24 capsid protein. The envelope of the virus contains glycoprotein gp120 and gp41.\n\n## Viral Replication Cycle\n\n## Attachment and Fusion\nHIV enters into the host cell through specific binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor on the host cell surface. CD4 receptors are predominantly found on T cells (also known as CD4+ T cells or T helper cells), dendritic cells, and macrophages. Co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 on the surface of these cells bind to gp120 allowing a conformational change that exposes gp41. The gp41 mediates fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane and entry into the host cell. \n\n## Reverse Transcription\nReverse transcription occurs after HIV enters the host cell. The RNA genome is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA. The enzyme responsible for this is reverse transcriptase. Once reverse transcription occurs, the DNA is integrated into the host DNA.\n\n## Integration\nThe pre-integration complex (PIC) consists of viral DNA and the viral integrase enzyme. The PIC enters the nucleus of the host cell. The integrase enzyme mediates the insertion of viral DNA into the host DNA through an endonuclease and DNA polymerase activity. Integration is an essential step in the replication of HIV and formation of the proviral DNA that remains latent within the cell.\n\n## Viral Replication\nAfter integration, the proviral DNA is transcribed into mRNAs and genomic RNAs",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "Explanation:\nThe most common amino acid modification is oxidation. Oxidative deamination is a common type of nonenzymatic deamination. Lysine, arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and tyrosine undergo nonenzymatic deamination in this way. In all cases, oxidation generates ammonia and keto acids, which are then catabolized. This type of deamination can result in a 30-50% loss of glutamic acid and lysine in cereal proteins during food processing.\n Answer: B",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "**Clinical Considerations**\nWhen a retrovirus enters the body, it can infect any cell that contains CD4 receptors on its cell surface. The virus replicates in the cell, killing the host cell. Over time, the viral particles overwhelm the host, depleting its immune system of immune cells that contain the CD4 receptors. Eventually, the immune system is unable to fight off disease-causing organisms, and the host dies from opportunistic infections.\n\n**Pathogenesis of HIV**\nAfter infection with HIV, patients have a brief period of acute HIV infection, characterized by a high viral load and few clinical symptoms. After this period, the patient enters the chronic stage, which may last up to 10 years. During this period, the viral load remains high, but there are few clinical symptoms and the patient may be unaware that they have been infected. Eventually, the viral load becomes so high that the immune system becomes incapable of fighting off opportunistic infections, and the disease enters the AIDS stage. The HIV virus can cause a range of different symptoms in infected patients. The viral envelope proteins can induce an inflammatory response that results in encephalitis, myocarditis, and nephritis. The virus can also damage the bone marrow, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Other patients may develop Kaposi sarcoma, a tumor that arises from the endothelial cells. Finally, the virus may cause generalized lymphadenopathy, in which lymph nodes become swollen.\n\n**Answer:**\nB. gp120\n**Explanation**\nA B-cell response to viral infection is initiated by the interaction between a B-cell receptor and an antigen. When a B-cell receptor binds to an antigen, the B cell undergoes a series of molecular modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation, that eventually lead to B-cell proliferation and antibody production. The HIV virus consists of three major envelope proteins: gp41, gp120, and gp160. gp160 is a precursor protein that is cleaved to generate gp41 and gp120. The gp41 protein binds to the membrane of a host cell. gp120 binds to CD4 receptors, which are necessary for the virus to enter the cell. It is also an immunodominant protein, meaning it induces an immune response from the body. HIV patients mount an immune response against gp120, and generate antibodies that are specific to this protein. Thus, the antibody generated by the physician scientist is most likely directed against gp41 and gp120. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "1. Histoplasma capsulatum 2. Cryptococcus neoformans 3. Aspergillus fumigatus 4. Coccidioides immitis\n**Explanation:**\n**Answer-3: Aspergillus fumigatus**\nAspergillus species (especially Aspergillus fumigatus) are the most common fungi to cause opportunistic pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts.\nThe organism can produce a spectrum of disease, depending upon the immune status of the patient:\n* Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a relatively benign and allergic form seen in asthmatics.\n* Pulmonary aspergilloma, a fungus ball in a pre-existing lung cavity in a patient with previous lung damage. It presents with hemoptysis.\n* Invasive aspergillosis (the most common form), seen in immunocompromised patients. It is usually disseminated, with a propensity for the brain. It has a mortality rate of 80% to 90%.\nThe radiologic picture shows a pulmonary cavity with the fungus ball.\nDiagnosis is made by isolating Aspergillus species from respiratory secretions.\nAmphotericin B is the drug of choice, but voriconazole and posaconazole may also be effective.\n**Morphologic identification of Fungal elements:**\nAspergillus species are septate hyphae that branch at 45-degree angles.\nCoccidioides immitis, the cause of coccidioidomycosis, forms spherules in infected tissue. It is endemic in the Southwestern United States and produces a pulmonary infection in a person exposed to its arthroconidia.\nThe arthroconidia are formed from hyphae, but the hyphae are not the form that infects the host. The arthroconidia in turn form spherules in infected tissue, which contain endospores.\nHistoplasma capsulatum, the cause of histoplasmosis, is a dimorphic fungus. It forms hyphae in the environment and the yeast form in infected tissue. The yeast cells are usually within the phagocytes and are relatively small (1 to 5 microns in diameter).\nCryptococcus neoformans, the cause of cryptococcosis, is a yeast that has an antiphagocytic capsule (the capsule forms a clear halo around the cells in India ink preparations of cerebrospinal fluid).",

    "question": " What would be the best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients?",
    "answer": "A systematic review\n\nBackground: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known as one of the important regulators of gene expression. They act as regulators for diverse molecular functions by influencing mRNA degradation and translation inhibition. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the dysregulation of miRNAs results in different immunological changes. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of miRNAs in HIV infection could help to develop new therapeutic approaches for HIV infection. The aim of this systematic review is to identify which miRNAs are involved in the HIV life cycle and to understand which methodological approaches have been used to investigate their role in this setting.Methods: A systematic review was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement (PRISMA) guidelines. Original articles were searched for in three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) with no time limitations. The keywords \"miRNA,\" \"HIV,\" and \"infection\" were used in different combinations.Results: A total of 1,054 articles were identified in the primary search, of which 44 were selected for full text reading and 24 were included for systematic review. This review highlighted the role of miR-93, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, miR-27b, and miR-29a in HIV infection, and showed that miRNA expression can be used as a diagnostic biomarker of HIV infection in both serum and PBMC samples. In addition, our results indicated that the therapeutic approaches that can be used in clinical practice to target miRNAs are mainly based on the administration of miRNA-mimics (inhibitors) and antisense oligonucleotides (antagonists). Conclusion: This systematic review allowed us to identify several miRNAs involved in HIV infection and to identify the methodological approaches used for their study. This information can be used to perform further studies and to explore new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HIV infection.\n\n# Background\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The mature miRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length that form an imperfect base pairing structure with their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), resulting in inhibition of translation or degradation of the mRNA molecule. The discovery of miRNAs as regulators of the gene expression has allowed the elucidation of",
    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."
