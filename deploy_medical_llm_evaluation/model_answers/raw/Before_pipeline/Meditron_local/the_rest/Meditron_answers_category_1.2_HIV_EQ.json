    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed by a blood test.\n\nWhat happens if I test positive for HIV?\nIf you test positive for HIV, you will need to see a doctor who has special training in HIV treatment. The doctor will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. Some people take a combination of medicines, called \"HAART\" (highly active antiretroviral therapy). These medicines help keep HIV from making copies of itself in the body. That way, HIV does not get worse.\n\nOther people do not take HAART right away. This is because the medicines have some serious side effects, and they can be hard to take. But it is important to know that people with HIV live longer when they take HAART. Your doctor will help you decide when you should start treatment.\n\nCan people with HIV live long, healthy lives?\nYes. People with HIV who take HAART can live long, healthy lives. The key is to get started on treatment and stay on it. If people stop taking their HAART medicines, HIV can get worse and cause more health problems. HIV medicines do not cure HIV, but they do help keep people healthy for many years.\n\nCan HIV be prevented?\nYes, you can prevent HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to not have sex or to be in a relationship with only one person who is also not having sex with other people. But if you are having sex, you can reduce your chances of getting HIV if you use condoms every time. It is also important not to inject drugs, because HIV can spread through needles.\n\nAre there medicines to prevent HIV?\nYes. There is a medicine called \"PrEP,\" which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It can be used to prevent HIV in people who are at risk of getting HIV, but who do not have it. PrEP is not for people who already have HIV. It is just for people who are at risk of getting it. PrEP works by keeping HIV from making copies of itself in the body.\n\nHow do I know if I should take PrEP?\nIf you are at risk of getting HIV, talk to your doctor about whether you should take PrEP. You should take PrEP if you:\n- Are in a relationship with someone who has HIV\n- Have unprotected sex with more than one person, or with someone whose HIV status you do not know\n- Inject drugs and share needles\n\nCan I stop taking PrEP once I start it?\nYes. You can stop taking PrEP when you are no longer at",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "\u2013 Part 2\nIf you have been diagnosed with HIV, it is important to be educated about how the virus behaves inside your body and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks your immune system, which makes it difficult for your body to defend itself against the onslaught of infection and disease.\nThere are three stages of HIV and each one represents a different level of progression of the disease. In our previous blog post, we discussed the first stage of the disease, which is called acute infection. The second stage is known as clinical latency and the third is AIDS. Read more about each of these stages of HIV here.\nClinical Latency\nIt\u2019s possible to have HIV for many years and not even know that you have it. You might not experience any symptoms, but you can still transmit the virus to others. During this period, you are in the clinical latency stage of the disease, which can last for more than a decade. During this time, the virus is still active inside your body and it is slowly damaging your immune system.\nAIDS\nWhen your immune system has been weakened to the point that you are no longer able to fight off certain illnesses, you have advanced to the third stage of HIV, which is known as AIDS. There are certain illnesses that your immune system would normally be able to fight off, but at this stage, it is no longer strong enough. These illnesses are called opportunistic infections and can lead to death.\nIf you have been diagnosed with HIV, the most important thing you can do is seek treatment right away. It is also essential to inform anyone you have been sexually intimate with about your diagnosis, and to seek medical advice from a specialist.\nIf you need help with substance abuse or mental illness in Fort Lauderdale, FL, call the South Florida Mental Health Consortium. We are a coalition of 16 non-profit agencies and have been providing these services since 1993.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "- HIV transmission\nHIV is primarily a bloodborne virus. That means that it is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids with blood. There are a few different body fluids that contain high amounts of HIV. These include:\nHIV is not found in other body fluids like sweat, tears, urine, saliva, feces, vomit, or breast milk. These fluids are not associated with HIV transmission.\nNow, here's something important. The other fluids that I mentioned, they're not 100% devoid of HIV. But there isn't enough HIV in these other fluids for them to transmit HIV. HIV is only found in high enough quantities to be transmitted in those three body fluids: blood, semen, and vaginal fluids.\nNow, if you look at where this table comes from, it's an NIH publication. It's from the U.S. government. And they're kind of like a one-stop shop for facts about HIV.\nNow, let's talk about how HIV is transmitted. This is the most important thing. HIV is transmitted through sexual contact, through sharing needles, and through pregnancy. That's how HIV is transmitted. These three methods of transmission are what make up the majority of HIV cases worldwide.\nThere are a few other ways to transmit HIV that are extremely rare. For example, you can get HIV from infected organ donors or from infected transfusion donors. If you are a health care worker, there's a very small chance of HIV transmission if you are accidentally stuck with a contaminated needle, which is called a needle stick injury.\nHowever, these other ways of getting HIV, those are extremely rare. In fact, they're so rare that we don't need to talk about them anymore. We're going to focus on the three main ways that HIV is transmitted. And that is through sexual contact, sharing needles, and through pregnancy.\nWe'll look at each of these one by one. So the first method of HIV transmission is through sexual contact. We've already seen in this table that HIV is found in semen and vaginal fluids. That means that HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact.\nNow, there are a few types of sexual contact. The first type of sexual contact is anal sex. Anal sex is the riskiest type of sexual contact. And that's because anal sex is a really rough form of sex. You can really damage the tissues around the anus. And you can also damage the inside of the anus. And that's where the HIV can get in.\nThere's one other form of sex that we need to",

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "The prevalence of comorbidities in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)\n\nThe Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) was established in 1984 to study the progression and natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. The MACS is a longitudinal cohort study that has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since inception in 1984. The MACS Public Dataset is a subset of the data that is available to the public after a standard application process. This analysis utilized the public access data from the MACS and the prevalence of comorbidities in the study was determined. Comorbidities were defined using the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (DCI). There was a high prevalence of comorbidities in the study population with cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders being the most common. The results suggest that there is a higher prevalence of comorbidities in those with HIV and comorbidities increase with age.\n\n# Introduction\nComorbidities are common in the general population, however, individuals living with HIV are more likely to have one or more comorbidities [bib_ref] Chronic comorbidities among HIVinfected persons with COVID-19: population-based cohort study of 1,609,..., Gervasoni [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Impact of aging and comorbidities on COVID-19 severity and mortality in a..., Rivas [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The association between chronic comorbidities and clinical outcomes in hospitalized people with..., Zini [/bib_ref]. In the general population, comorbidities are known to increase the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. It has been hypothesized that the high prevalence of comorbidities among those living with HIV could explain why this group appears to be at higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, this hypothesis has not been confirmed, as there is a paucity of data and the results are conflicting [bib_ref] Chronic comorbidities among HIVinfected persons with COVID-19: population-based cohort study of 1,609,..., Gervasoni [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Impact of aging and comorbidities on COVID-19 severity and mortality in a..., Rivas [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The association between",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "How can transmission of HIV from an HIV-infected mother to her infant be prevented?\n- There are a number of interventions that are effective in reducing HIV transmission.\n- Avoiding unsafe sex and use of condoms. In the industrialized world, unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse, particularly among young people, remains the primary mode of HIV transmission.\n- Avoiding sharing needles and syringes for intravenous drug use. In many countries where injection drug use is common, HIV infection has become epidemic among drug users. The practice of sharing syringes in this setting increases the risk of HIV transmission.\n- Avoiding blood transfusions from infected donors. This risk is now very low in most industrialized countries because of routine HIV testing of blood. In some countries, there is still a risk of HIV infection from transfusion.\n- In the industrialized world, many of the interventions focus on the identification of HIV-infected individuals and reducing their risk of transmission. These interventions include testing, partner notification, condom distribution and needle exchange, and antiretroviral treatment.\n- The use of antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection in the mother is one of the most effective interventions to reduce transmission of HIV from mother to child, but it is expensive and is often not feasible in resource-poor settings. Without intervention, 15-30% of children born to HIV-infected mothers are infected. A variety of simple and cost-effective strategies to reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) have been proven to be effective. These strategies combine antiretroviral medications given to the mother during pregnancy and labor, and to the newborn after birth. In some resource-poor settings, where breastfeeding is universal, antiretroviral drugs are also given to the infant for the duration of breastfeeding. These interventions are highly effective in preventing MTCT.\n- There are also interventions to prevent infection in HIV-exposed infants after they are born. These include safe infant feeding practices, such as exclusive formula feeding, and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "The ART is to be taken regularly on an everyday basis irrespective of how long a person lives with the HIV infection. The ART is taken for lifelong, which means once ART is started, it must be taken as prescribed every day, for the rest of one's life. If you start ART, you have to take medicines as prescribed and as long as you live. You will need to take ART even if you are feeling completely healthy. It's also important that ART be taken every day. If you miss a dose, your viral load may go up, and the HIV infection may get worse. You will also be at risk for developing resistance to HIV medicines. If you have trouble taking ART every day or you are unable to take it for some reason, talk to your doctor.",

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n## Answer\n### Switch Between Latent and Active HIV Infection\nA switch in the HIV life cycle exists in a process that involves the recruitment of host factors, which may be targeted by therapeutic agents. This represents a promising approach in antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
