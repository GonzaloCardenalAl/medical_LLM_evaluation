    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "**\nOBJECTIVE To estimate the number of individuals treated in Switzerland in 1990 with the five most frequently used antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. METHODS Based on information from 13 hospitals, four private clinics and three ARV dispensing centres, we estimated the numbers of individuals treated with AZT, DDI, DDC, D4T and ddl during the first six months of 1990. To estimate the total numbers of individuals treated in 1990 we assumed that the numbers of individuals started on treatment increased linearly. The proportion of individuals who were started on a specific ARV was estimated and applied to the number of individuals started on ARV treatment in 1990. RESULTS Between January and June 1990 a total of 1,004 individuals were treated with at least one of the five most frequently used ARVs. We estimated that between 750 and 850 individuals were treated with AZT, 350 to 410 with DDI, 200 to 230 with DDC, 120 to 130 with D4T and 30 to 50 with ddl in Switzerland during the year 1990. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that a relatively small number of individuals was treated with ARV drugs in Switzerland in 1990, a number that is much smaller than that estimated by the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "A sentinel surveillance study\n\nBackground: In 2008, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health launched a sentinel surveillance system to collect HIV testing and counselling data in order to estimate the number of individuals tested, prevalence, proportion of newly diagnosed infections, and the proportion of people living with HIV unaware of their infection. As part of this surveillance system, data on pregnancies are also collected. The objective of this study was to compare the birth rate among women with HIV and the birth rate in the general population in Switzerland. Methods: The birth rate in Switzerland was estimated from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) data. The birth rate in women with HIV was estimated from sentinel surveillance data using the data collected at the end of the first antenatal visit from women presenting for antenatal care at a centre participating in the Swiss mother and child HIV cohort study (MoCHiV). Data were collected between January 2010 and December 2011. The birth rate ratio was defined as the birth rate in women with HIV divided by the birth rate in the general population.Results: Overall, the birth rate was 12.0 births per 1,000 women in the general population versus 5.1 births per 1,000 women with HIV (birth rate ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.52, p < 0.001). For women with HIV born in Switzerland, the birth rate was 4.8 per 1,000 women versus 11.9 in the general population (birth rate ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.65, p < 0.001). For women with HIV from the rest of the world, the birth rate was 5.2 per 1,000 women versus 13.0 in the general population (birth rate ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.53, p < 0.001). For women with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa, the birth rate was 6.5 per 1,000 women versus 12.9 in the general population (birth rate ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.38-0.66, p < 0.001).Conclusion: This study suggests that women with HIV in Switzerland, regardless of their geographical origin, have fewer births than the general population. However, this study may not be generalisable to all HIV-positive women living in Switzerland.\n\n# Background\nSw",

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Results from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study\n\nIn Switzerland, a substantial proportion of HIV diagnoses have been recorded in men having sex with men (MSM), and in people from countries where HIV is endemic. We analysed the sources of infection in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We analysed data from 18,529 individuals with a documented HIV infection in the SHCS, and we used logistic regression models to determine the source of infection by country of origin. In Switzerland, sexual contact with an individual from a country where HIV is endemic was the main risk factor for HIV infection. The adjusted odds ratio for HIV infection was 7.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.90-8.73) for heterosexuals with a partner from a country with high HIV prevalence, 2.63 (95% CI 1.93-3.59) for heterosexuals with a partner from a country with medium HIV prevalence, and 3.15 (95% CI 2.37-4.20) for MSM with a partner from a country with high HIV prevalence, compared with heterosexuals with a partner from a country with low HIV prevalence. Our data suggest that prevention programs should target heterosexuals with partners from a country where HIV is endemic.\n\n# Introduction\nAlthough it is difficult to determine the source of HIV infection for every person, surveillance programs provide data on HIV infections, the mode of transmission and the country of birth, and are useful to identify at-risk groups and to tailor prevention programs [bib_ref] Sexual transmission of HIV according to viral load and antiretroviral therapy: systematic..., Attia [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Surveillance for transmission of HIV infection, risk factors, and prevention measures among..., Mastro [/bib_ref].

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "What proportion of those who died had their first positive HIV test after the age of 65?\nBackground: In the developed world, an increasing proportion of people with HIV (PWH) are older, and have therefore lived with the virus for a long time. Objective: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of PWH who died, according to the age at first positive HIV test. Methods: Using the Swiss HIV Cohort Study database, we selected people who had died between 2005 and 2014 (most recent follow-up), and excluded people lost to follow-up or for whom the date of first positive HIV test was unknown. Based on age at first positive HIV test, we separated them into 4 groups (\u2264 20 years, 21-40 years, 41-65 years, and >65 years). We described their demographic and clinical characteristics at the date of first positive HIV test and at death, as well as causes of death, using frequency and mean. Results: Among the 1238 PWH who died during the study period, 1038 (84%) had their first positive HIV test at the age of 21 or older. Compared to younger people, they were more likely to be men (93%), white, heterosexual, and were less likely to be injection drug users (IDUs) (Table). At death, older PWH were more likely to be HIV controllers (viral load <200 copies/mL, off ART), had lower CD4 nadir, were more likely to have AIDS-defining diseases, had higher cardiovascular and liver fibrosis FIB4 index, and were more likely to be on ART at death (Table). Causes of death were mostly non-AIDS-defining malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases. Overall, 17 (1%) of those who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20 and 26 (2%) after the age of 65. Conclusion: PWH who died had mostly acquired the infection at the age of 21 or older, and had a long history of HIV infection. They died mainly from non-AIDS-defining malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases.\nNo significant gender, race or age differences were found in terms of HIV related variables among patients with a positive and negative HCV screen at any of the time points measured. Patients with a positive HCV screen had significantly higher CD4 counts at baseline and at 6 months compared to those with a negative screen, although this difference",

    "answer": "(2007)\n\nIn this systematic review, there are 2 studies that report a significant difference between the initial CD4 cell count among PWH tested under and above 20 years of age. However, it was not possible to pool data from these studies due to a high heterogeneity (I 2 = 85%).\nThere are no studies that report the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 in individuals tested under and above 20 years of age. The 4 studies that report this outcome for other age thresholds do not show a significant difference.\nThis systematic review shows a trend towards a lower initial CD4 cell count in PWH tested at an older age. The findings regarding the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 are inconclusive. 9 9\nThere is a trend towards a lower initial CD4 cell count in PWH tested at an older age. The findings regarding the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 are inconclusive.",
