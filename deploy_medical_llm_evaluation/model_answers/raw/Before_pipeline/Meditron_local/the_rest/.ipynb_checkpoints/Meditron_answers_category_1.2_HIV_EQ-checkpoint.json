    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "To find out if you have an HIV infection, you should have a blood test. There are 3 main types of HIV tests. They work in different ways.\n- A \"rapid\" test, which works in less than 30 minutes\n- An HIV antibody test\n- A test to look for HIV's genetic material\n\nIf your rapid or antibody test is positive for HIV, it does not always mean you are infected with HIV. Sometimes, these tests give a false-positive result, meaning they show that you are infected when you really aren't. To make sure, doctors have to do another test to confirm that you really are infected.\n\nAnother kind of HIV test is a test that looks for HIV's genetic material. This test can tell if you are infected or not, and it can do this before a rapid or antibody test can.\n\nWhat should I do if I have a new HIV infection?\nIf you have a new HIV infection, you should start treatment with HIV medicines right away. The medicines can prevent serious infections and other illnesses. Plus, the medicines can help keep the virus from getting worse.\n\nThere are many HIV medicines. Most people with HIV take at least 3 medicines every day. Taking HIV medicines every day is very important. If you do not take your HIV medicines every day, the virus can get worse and can also become resistant to your medicines. This means that your HIV medicines will no longer work. Also, if you have HIV, taking HIV medicines every day can help keep you from spreading the infection to others.\n\nIt can be hard to take your HIV medicines every day. But it is very important to do so. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out how to fit the medicines into your daily routine.\n\nHow does HIV treatment work?\nThe medicines do not cure the infection or get rid of the virus. But they do keep the virus under control.\n\nHIV medicines work in different ways (figure 1):\n- Some medicines keep the virus from making copies of itself. This makes the amount of virus in your body (called your \"viral load\") go down.\n- Other medicines help keep your body's infection-fighting system (also called your \"immune system\") from getting too weak. One way doctors measure your immune system is by counting the number of special cells called \"CD4 cells\" in your blood. When the virus kills CD4 cells, your viral load goes up and your CD4 count goes down.\n\nHIV medicines can also help prevent or treat conditions related to HIV. There are medicines that treat",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "What is the treatment?\nReviewed by: Dr. Archana Kadam Chaulkar | Author: Mamta Singh\nHIV is a viral disease caused by a virus named human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks our immune system. A compromised immune system cannot fight other infections and diseases. As a result, an infected person suffers from various health issues and illnesses. Without treatment, a person can develop AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the last stage of HIV infection.\nHIV spreads through:\n- Unprotected sex with an infected person\n- Infected needle\n- Infected blood transfusion\n- Mother to child during childbirth, breastfeeding, or pregnancy\n- A person can live with HIV and not know. The only way to know if you have HIV is to get tested.\n- There is no cure for HIV. However, medications are available to treat the disease.\n- If treated correctly, people with HIV can lead normal, healthy lives for many years.\n- There are many things to learn about HIV. This article will help you understand different stages of HIV.\nWhat is HIV?\nHIV is a type of virus that attacks our immune system. It targets the CD4 cells, which are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. These cells are called T cells.\nHow HIV spreads?\nA healthy individual should have a T-cell count of at least 500 to 1600. A person with HIV may have more than 500 T cells. But if his T-cell count drops below 200, the immune system is compromised. It can no longer fight off infections. Thus, the person becomes sick easily.\nDifferent stages of HIV infection\nThere are three different stages of HIV infection. The symptoms vary from stage to stage.\n1. Stage 1- Acute HIV Infection\nThe first stage is the acute HIV infection stage. It can last for 2-4 weeks. During this period, a person can experience flu-like symptoms. It is essential to get tested for HIV. If you have had unprotected sex, used contaminated needles, or had blood transfusion recently, consult your doctor immediately.\n2. Stage 2 \u2013 Chronic HIV infection\nIn the second stage, HIV infection becomes chronic. There are no symptoms. The virus can remain inactive in the body for several years. If you have HIV and not getting treated, your immune system will weaken. It may take up to 10 years before the disease progresses to AIDS.\n3. Stage 3 \u2013 AIDS\nAIDS",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": ".\nWhen can HIV be transmitted?\n- HIV is most often transmitted during unprotected sex. It can be spread when a man ejaculates in the anus or vagina of a person without HIV.\n- HIV can also be spread if infected blood enters another person's body. For example, this can happen when a needle used by an infected person is shared with someone else. This can also happen during childbirth or breastfeeding.\n- HIV can be spread if an infected person shares a needle with someone else. HIV can also be spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of someone who does not have the virus. For example, this can happen when a person without HIV has contact with infected blood during a medical or dental procedure. In countries where blood donations are screened, there is very little risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion.\n- HIV cannot be spread through touch, saliva, snot, sweat, urine, or tears.\n\nCan I get HIV by sharing personal items with an infected person?\n- Probably not: People with HIV rarely or never spread the virus by sharing food or drinks, towels, or toothbrushes.\n\nShould I get tested for HIV?\n- Many people ask this question. The best answer for you depends on your personal risk of being infected. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out your risk and whether you should get tested.\n\nWhen will I know if I have HIV?\n- Most people infected with HIV have a rapid reaction. They usually feel sick, with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, headache, or rash. But some people do not have any symptoms when they first get infected.\n\nIf I do not have any symptoms, how can I tell if I have HIV?\n- You can get a blood test or other test to check for HIV.\n\nWhat happens if I have HIV?\n- You will need to see a doctor for treatment. You will also need to take extra precautions so you don't spread HIV to others. For example, you should always use a condom when you have sex. Also, you should never share needles or syringes with anyone. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out what else you need to do.\n\nWhat medicines are available to treat HIV?\n- There are many different medicines for HIV. A combination of different medicines is usually used to treat the infection. Doctors call this \"combination antiretroviral therapy\" (or \"ART\"). The medicines work in different ways. Some of them fight the virus directly. Others stop the virus from multiplying. When used together, these medicines help keep the",

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "A systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nBackground: To understand how best to respond to the growing burden of comorbidity among people living with HIV (PLWH), a systematic and quantitative review is needed to establish which comorbidities are common and the prevalence of these conditions. Methods: We searched OVID Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for studies of PLWH published since 2012 that reported comorbidities. We conducted meta-analyses to determine the prevalence of comorbidities and to examine the impact of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Results: We included 72 studies in the review: 61 in the meta-analyses. Most studies were from high-income countries. We identified 31 comorbidities. The three most prevalent were hypertension (prevalence: 29% 95% CI 26-31%), non-AIDS cancer (8% 95% CI 6-9%) and depression (13% 95% CI 11-15%). In pooled analysis, depression was the only comorbidity to be significantly more prevalent in women than men (RR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.27-1.76), while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.91) and hypertension (RR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87) were significantly more prevalent in men than women. A higher proportion of people on ART reported hypertension (RR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.22-1.68) and cardiovascular disease (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.48). Depression was the only comorbidity that was significantly associated with older age (RR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) and a longer duration of HIV infection (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04).Conclusions: Our findings highlight the changing landscape of comorbidities among PLWH, including the high burden of mental health comorbidity. However, a high proportion of included studies did not control for the effect of ageing. Research is needed to understand the burden of non-communicable diseases among PLWH in lower-and middle-income countries and the potential for comorbidity clusters among PLWH.\n\n# Introduction\nAs ant",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "What's the treatment for HIV? How will my quality of life change?\nHow can HIV be prevented?\nThe HIV virus lives in blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk. To protect yourself from being infected with HIV:\n- Always use a condom during sexual intercourse.\n- Do not share needles with other people. If you are an injecting drug user, get help from your doctor, health clinic or drug user support group.\n- Do not share razors or toothbrushes with others.\n- Do not have tattoos or body piercing, or only use an establishment that uses sterile disposable equipment.\n- If you need a blood transfusion, check with your doctor first to make sure the blood is tested for HIV.\n- Make sure any blood products you use are heat treated.\n- If you work in a health care setting, follow universal precautions carefully.\nIf you think you may have been infected with HIV, talk to your doctor. You may be able to take medicines to prevent HIV infection from developing if you have been exposed to the HIV virus. This is called postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The medicine used for PEP is antiretroviral therapy (ART).\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults be tested for HIV once. People at high risk of getting HIV should be tested more often. Ask your doctor how often you should be tested.\nWhat's the treatment for HIV?\nAlthough there is no cure for HIV, a number of medicines are used to treat the disease. These medicines fall into different classes:\n- Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): These drugs block an HIV enzyme called reverse transcriptase. By blocking this enzyme, NRTIs prevent HIV from making copies of itself. Examples of NRTIs include zidovudine (brand name: Retrovir), tenofovir (Viread) and abacavir (Ziagen).\n- Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): These drugs also block the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase, but they do it in a different way than NRTIs. Examples of NNRTIs include efavirenz (Sustiva) and nevirapine (Viramune).\n- Protease inhibitors (PIs): These drugs block the HIV enzyme protease, which the virus needs to make copies of itself. PIs seem to work best in combination with NRTIs. They can cause problems with other medicines you take. So tell your doctor",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": ".\nWhen did it all start?\nThe prevention of perinatal HIV transmission is a landmark public health achievement of the twentieth century. In the early 1990\u2019s, before the advent of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, the risk of a mother-to-child transmission of HIV was estimated to be 20-30%. Over the past two decades, the number of babies born with HIV has dramatically declined because of the discovery and adoption of proven interventions to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that currently only 1-2% of babies born to HIV positive mothers have HIV infection.\nIn 1994, a landmark clinical trial called PACTG 076 (conducted in the United States and France), demonstrated that the administration of ARV drugs to HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborn babies could reduce the transmission of HIV from mother to baby by nearly two thirds.\nThe impact of the prevention of mother to child transmission in India\nIn the 1990\u2019s in India, studies showed that the perinatal HIV transmission rate ranged between 30-40% which was similar to the rate observed in the West. However, the number of HIV infected women were significantly higher in India compared to the West. Thus the number of babies born with HIV infection in India was enormous. In 2003, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) launched its PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) programme with the aim of reducing perinatal HIV transmission. A large cohort study conducted in 2005-06 in South India that compared perinatal HIV transmission rates in babies born to women who were enrolled in the PMTCT program to the rates in babies born to women who were not enrolled in the program reported that the risk of HIV transmission was significantly reduced from 31.4% in the latter group to 9.5% in the former group. However, the perinatal transmission risk in women enrolled in the program was higher than the risk observed in the US and Europe in the mid-1990s. NACO revised its PMTCT protocol in 2012, and currently perinatal HIV transmission rates in India are 2.7%.\nWhat are the factors that lead to perinatal transmission of HIV from mother to child?\nThe factors that are associated with an increased risk of mother to child transmission of HIV include: maternal viral load, anemia, low CD4 count, genital ulcers,",

The most common ways that HIV spreads is through anal or vaginal sex without a condom or other barrier method and injection drug use with a needle that was already used by someone who is infected with HIV.\nThere are many ways that you can protect yourself from getting HIV. In addition to avoiding sex and drug use, you can use:\n- Latex male condoms or female condoms (called \"internal condoms\") (figure 1)\n- A clean needle each time if you inject drugs\n- A medicine called \"PrEP\" or pre-exposure prophylaxis, which can reduce the risk of getting HIV\n\nIs there a cure for HIV?\nNo. There is no cure for HIV. But most people who get HIV infection can lead normal lives if they take their medicines and work with their healthcare team. If people with HIV take their medicines exactly as prescribed, their HIV cannot be spread to others.\n\nHow do people with HIV stay healthy?\nPeople with HIV can stay healthy by:\n- Working closely with their healthcare team\n- Taking their medicines exactly as prescribed\n- Making healthy lifestyle choices, such as not smoking, getting exercise, and eating a healthy diet\n\nThe medicines for HIV can cause side effects. But they are not life-threatening. If you take your medicines as directed, you can control the virus so that it does not damage your immune system.\n\nIs there a test for HIV?\nYes. There are different tests for HIV, but they all look for the virus itself or for the antibodies your body makes against the virus. The most common test is a blood test. If you test positive for HIV, it means that you have HIV. If you test negative, it means that you don't have HIV.\n\nHow often should I be tested for HIV?\nPeople who have never had an HIV test should get tested at least once.

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "This study looks at how HIV-1 infection and replication occurs in patients who do not have symptoms of the disease, and how it might affect the brain.\nAbstract\nObjective: In HIV, CNS infection occurs at seroconversion, but may become dormant. We tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 proviral DNA can remain transcriptionally inactive for extended periods in mononuclear phagocytes (MP; monocytes, brain macrophages, and microglia) in blood and brain, and subsequently reactivate.\nMethods: In vitro, we infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia with HIV-1 and cultured them for 2 months. HIV-1 RNA and p24 antigen were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Proviral DNA was quantitated by quantitative real-time PCR of MDM proviral DNA with or without viral reactivation with tumor necrosis factor-a. In patients, we analyzed postmortem brain tissues from 4 HIV+ subjects and 5 uninfected controls, using laser capture microdissection, followed by single-cell proviral DNA PCR.\nResults: In MDM, HIV-1 replication peaked at 14 days and then declined by 50% to 60% over 2 months. However, the quantity of proviral DNA per cell remained unchanged, indicating a switch from productive to latent infection. Microglia, like MDM, became productively infected with HIV-1. In patients, 7.5% of brain MP were HIV-1-infected. In a subset of these patients, CD163+ MP harbored proviral DNA without detectable RNA, indicative of latent infection.\nConclusion: These data demonstrate that, in vitro, HIV-1-infected primary human MDM and microglia can remain in a quiescent state for at least 2 months after initial productive infection, and can be reactivated. In vivo, the percentage of productively infected MP in brain is low (7.5%), and the number of latently infected cells is even lower. This latent reservoir may serve as a mechanism for persistence of HIV-1 in the CNS, despite effective antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
