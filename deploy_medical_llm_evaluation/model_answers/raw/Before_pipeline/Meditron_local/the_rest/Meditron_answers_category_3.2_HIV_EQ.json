    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "(See Figure 2-15.)\n**Understanding Mechanisms in HIV**\n\n\n**Figure 2-15** HIV Genome\nThe humoral immune system targets the HIV envelope proteins (gp41, gp120). The other HIV proteins are inside the viral particle and are not seen by the humoral immune system.\n### Answer:\nGp120 is the target of most neutralizing antibodies generated by the humoral immune response to HIV. The envelope proteins, gp120 and gp41, are the target of the humoral immune response, while the other HIV proteins are not seen by the humoral immune response and are not targeted by neutralizing antibodies.\n### Explanation:\nGp120 is the target of most neutralizing antibodies generated by the humoral immune response to HIV. The envelope proteins, gp120 and gp41, are the target of the humoral immune response, while the other HIV proteins are not seen by the humoral immune response and are not targeted by neutralizing antibodies.\ngp120 binds to CD4 on the surface of T cells and is the target of most neutralizing antibodies. gp41 is also a target of the immune response, but it is much more difficult to make effective neutralizing antibodies to gp41. The most potent neutralizing antibody that targets gp41 is called b12, which blocks the conformational change required for gp41 to form a hairpin structure that facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Although gp41 is an effective target, it is technically difficult to produce a neutralizing antibody that binds to this protein. All of the other proteins are not exposed to the immune system and are not targeted by neutralizing antibodies.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "(1) Aspergillus (2) Fusarium (3) Mucor (4) Cryptococcus (5) Candida\n### Answer:\n(1) Aspergillus\nExplanation:\nHIV-infected patients are at an increased risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). In the proper clinical setting, diagnosis can be made on biopsy specimens and/or respiratory samples demonstrating septate hyphae with dichotomous branching at 45-degree angles. The most common species causing invasive aspergillosis is A. fumigatus, followed by A. flavus and A. niger. These molds are ubiquitous in the environment and are commonly isolated as contaminants from clinical specimens. The isolation of Aspergillus spp. from sterile sites (e.g., blood, deep tissue, etc.), however, is diagnostic. The disease manifests with acute and subacute pulmonary presentations. The most common clinical presentation is acute tracheobronchitis with an abrupt onset of dyspnea, fever, and cough. Hemoptysis occurs in less than 50% of cases, and chest radiographs are typically normal. Subacute disease is characterized by the development of pneumonia over 1-3 weeks. Presenting symptoms include fever, dyspnea, and non-productive cough, and chest radiographs can demonstrate lobar or segmental infiltrates, cavitary lesions, or pleural effusions. Treatment is with intravenous voriconazole.\n Answer: A",

One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": ".\n### Explanation\n\nIn cases of reportable diseases, physicians are mandated to report the diagnosis to the Department of Public Health in their state. The Department of Public Health then attempts to contact the infected patient to elicit a list of sexual and needle-sharing contacts for the purpose of notification and testing. It is then the responsibility of the Department of Public Health to contact the persons at risk and offer testing and counseling. As long as the patient is compliant with reporting, the physician is not ethically obligated to disclose a patient's diagnosis of HIV to an unknowing partner. However, the patient should be encouraged to do so. The physician is obligated to encourage the patient to abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse with unknowing partners until they have been tested. Physicians who fail to encourage compliance with reporting a reportable disease may be in violation of the law.\n Answer: A",

    "answer": "Additionally, assume the patient\u2019s CD4 count was less than 100 cells/mm3, which drug would be best to treat this patient?\n### CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS\n\n **Epidemiology and Morphology**\n\n Cryptococcus neoformans, the causative agent of cryptococcosis, is a 2\u20135-\u03bcm-diameter oval yeast with a 2\u20133-\u03bcm wide, polysaccharide capsule, and narrow-based buds. It is a facultative intracellular, heterothallic basidiomycete. The organism is an opportunistic fungus, typically found in soil contaminated with pigeon droppings, which is then ingested by humans (see Figure 6-4).\n\n The two most common serotypes of C. neoformans are serotypes A and D. C. neoformans serotype D is the less virulent, yet less common, of the two serotypes, and C. neoformans serotype A is more common and more virulent. A closely related species, C. gattii (previously considered C. neoformans serotype B and C), is a less common cause of cryptococcosis and is most commonly found in Eucalyptus tree habitats in tropical or subtropical areas of the world.\n\n **Clinical Disease**\n\n C. neoformans has a propensity for infecting patients with T-cell dysfunction. These patients are often immunosuppressed by HIV, glucocorticoid treatment, chemotherapy, or organ trans- plantation. Infection of an immunocompetent host typically occurs by inhalation of spores, which can lead to a pneumonia, although in immunocompetent hosts the infection is most often asymptomatic. A primary pulmonary infection typically does not require treatment. In an immunocompromised patient, inhalation of spores may lead to pneumonia and dissemination of the infection to the central nervous system, resulting in meningoencephalitis. Patients with C. neoformans meningoencephalitis have headaches, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. If untreated, the infection can be fatal in a few weeks.\n\n **Clinical Diagnosis**\n\n Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is made by isolation and identification of C. neoformans on culture. It is difficult to visualize this yeast in tissue. India ink staining may demonstrate encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, less commonly, in the blood",

    "question": " What would be the best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients?",
    "answer": "A systematic review\n\nBackground: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing, being crucial in many physiological and pathological processes. The miRNA-mediated regulatory network is particularly interesting in the context of HIV infection, as it can regulate the expression of both viral and host genes. Indeed, the miRNAs profile in HIV-infected patients changes and may be associated with disease progression. In addition, antiviral treatment modulates the expression of several miRNAs, suggesting that they can be considered as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HIV infection. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to identify miRNAs that could act as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in HIV infection and to critically analyze the methodological approaches that have been used to address them. Results: A total of 39 articles were identified. The most relevant miRNAs acting as biomarkers in HIV infection were miR-223, miR-146a and miR-150 (dendritic cells), miR-17/92 family (T cells), miR-198 (T cells and macrophages), miR-29a and miR-29b (T cells, macrophages and microglia), miR-99b (monocytes), miR-150 (monocytes), miR-181a (CD4+ T cells), miR-326 (CD4+ T cells), miR-155 (CD4+ T cells, macrophages and microglia), miR-20b (CD4+ T cells and brain tissue), miR-21 (CD4+ T cells and brain tissue), miR-28 (CD4+ T cells and brain tissue), miR-99a (CD4+ T cells, monocytes and brain tissue), miR-29b (CD4+ T cells and macrophages), miR-133b (CD4+ T cells, monocytes and microglia), miR-9 and miR-34a (brain tissue), miR-132 (T cells and microglia), miR-146a (CD4+ T cells, monocytes, macrophages and microglia), miR-223 (CD4+ T cells, monocytes, macrophages and microglia), and miR-150 (monocytes and macrophages).

    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."
