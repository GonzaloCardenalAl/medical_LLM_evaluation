    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "What are HIV tests?\nAn HIV test is a test that checks to see if you have been infected with HIV. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, which is the body's natural defense against infection and disease. People who get HIV often go on to develop AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). AIDS is a condition in which the immune system is so weak that it cannot fight off other diseases. There is no cure for HIV, but there are medicines to help manage the disease. HIV can be spread by having sex with an infected person, sharing needles or syringes with an infected person, or being exposed to infected blood. Mothers with HIV can also pass it on to their unborn babies. Some people are at higher risk of getting HIV than others. You can read more about HIV testing and who should get tested at www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing.\n\nWhat do the results of an HIV test mean?\nThe results of an HIV test can be 1 of the following:\n- Positive: This means that you have HIV.\n- Negative: This means that you do not have HIV.\n- Indeterminate or inconclusive: This means that the results of your test were not clear. You will need another test to find out if you have HIV. An inconclusive test result is not a \"false positive.\" A false positive test is one that shows that a person has HIV when he or she does not.\n\nShould I get tested for HIV?\nMost people should get tested for HIV, but some people are at higher risk than others. You should definitely get tested if you:\n- Had sex without using a condom\n- Had sex with someone who is HIV positive\n- Are a man who has sex with other men\n- Injected drugs and shared a needle or syringe with someone else\n- Had sex with someone who injected drugs and shared a needle or syringe with someone else\n- Had sex with someone you do not know well\n\nEven if you think you are not at risk for HIV, you should get tested at least once. Some people at risk for HIV do not know it, because they cannot tell if their partner has HIV. For example, some people might not know their partner injects drugs. Other people might have a partner who has HIV but does not know it. Plus, you could have been at risk in the past, even if you are not now. (For example, you could have used drugs and shared needles in the past.)\n\nThe only way to know if you have HIV is to get tested.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "How long can you live after being infected?\nHow long can you live after being infected with HIV? That's a great question, and the answer depends on several factors, including your viral load, how quickly you were diagnosed and how soon you started treatment.\nWithout antiretroviral therapy, the average person with HIV could expect to live only 9 to 11 years after infection. However, with modern medicine and antiretroviral therapy, a person with HIV can expect to live a nearly normal life.\nHere's a general outline of the stages of HIV progression, and how long you might expect to live at each stage.\nPrimary Infection\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called primary infection. After you are infected with HIV, the virus rapidly replicates. This stage usually lasts for several weeks and it is not easily detectable. Symptoms of primary infection include:\n- Fever\n- Fatigue\n- Sore throat\n- Muscle pain\n- Swollen lymph nodes\n- Rash\n- Headache\nDuring this stage, your viral load is high. This makes it easy to transmit the virus. In fact, research shows that a person with untreated HIV is most contagious during the 2 to 4 weeks following infection. Even though you are unlikely to know you are infected during primary infection, you can still transmit the virus to others. During this period of high viral activity, your immune system ramps up production of antibodies to fight HIV. This is called seroconversion.\nIn general, it takes about 3 weeks for you to seroconvert. However, it can take up to 6 months in some people. After this time, you will test positive for HIV on an antibody test. Keep in mind that during the initial 3 weeks, you will probably test negative for HIV, even though you may have high levels of the virus in your blood.\nAcute Infection\nAfter 2 to 4 weeks, the viral load of HIV drops dramatically. This is because your immune system has created antibodies to fight the virus. At this point, your viral load will still be higher than it will be during later stages of HIV. But it is much lower than during primary infection. So, while you are still very contagious, you are not as contagious as you were during primary infection.\nUnfortunately, many people do not have HIV symptoms during acute infection. So, many people do not realize they are infected and do not seek medical treatment. Even if you do not have symptoms, you should still get tested. If you are",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is spread through contact with body fluids from an infected person, such as during sex or if a drug user shares needles with an infected person. HIV can also be spread from an infected pregnant woman to her baby during pregnancy, during labor, or during breastfeeding.\n\nMost people do not get HIV from their sexual partners. This is because HIV does not survive well outside the body. But if you have sex with an infected person, you can get HIV through your mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are the thin layers of tissue lining the inside of the mouth, anus, penis, vagina, and other parts of the body.\n\nTo lower your chance of getting HIV from an infected partner, make sure you use a condom each time you have vaginal or anal sex. (Condoms are not usually needed for oral sex. For more information on oral sex, see below.)\n\nIt is important to use a condom even if you or your partner uses birth control or has had a sterilization procedure (\"tubal ligation\" in women or \"vasectomy\" in men). This is because birth control and sterilization procedures do not protect against HIV infection.\n\nWhat if I am allergic to latex?\nMost condoms are made of latex, which some people are allergic to. You can use a condom made of lambskin, but these types of condoms are not as good as latex at preventing pregnancy. If you are allergic to latex and want to prevent pregnancy, you can use a female condom or a condom made out of plastic. Condoms made of plastic are called \"polyurethane\" condoms.\n\nDoes having oral sex protect against HIV?\nHaving oral sex with an infected person is not as likely to lead to HIV infection as having vaginal or anal sex. This is because there is less of the virus in saliva, which is the fluid in the mouth. But it is still possible to get HIV from oral sex, so it is still important to use a condom.\n\nCan I get HIV if I have sex with a partner who is taking HIV medicines?\nYes. Even if your partner is taking medicines to treat HIV, you can still get HIV. This is because your partner can still spread the virus, even if you cannot see it in his or her blood. So if your partner has HIV, you should use a condom each time you have sex, even if your partner is taking medicine.\n\nHow can I lower my chance of getting HIV?\nTo lower your chance of getting HIV, you can:\n- Get tested for HIV before starting a sexual relationship with someone. You",

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "A systematic review of observational studies\n\n\n\n# Background\nIt is widely recognised that HIV infection is associated with a range of comorbidities, in addition to the opportunistic infections that can occur in advanced HIV disease. Comorbidities can be divided into infectious (such as hepatitis B and C) and non-infectious (including cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental illness). They can be related to HIV itself, or be caused by antiretroviral treatment. Comorbidities can also be a direct result of lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use and obesity, which can be more common in people living with HIV (PLWH). The increased prevalence of these lifestyle factors in PLWH compared with the general population has been reported in observational studies, although it is difficult to disentangle the extent to which this is due to HIV infection itself or socioeconomic factors associated with HIV transmission. [bib_ref] Smoking prevalence in HIV: a systematic review, Reynolds [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risky alcohol use among persons with HIV: a higher threshold for intervention, Braithwaite [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Association of obesity with HIV chronic inflammation and clinical response after initiation..., Rossouw [/bib_ref] With increasing use of effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) over the past two decades, PLWH are living longer and the clinical landscape is now dominated by comorbidities.

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": ".\nWhat is HIV?.\nWhen can you start treatment for HIV?\nThe goal of HIV treatment is to keep your immune system as healthy as possible. That way you will be less likely to get infections that can make you sick. People with HIV usually start treatment with medicines soon after they are diagnosed. But some people wait until their immune system starts to get weaker.\n\nWhat are the side effects of HIV treatment?\nMedicines to treat HIV can have side effects. Side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and rash. Some side effects can be very serious, such as kidney damage or heart problems. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you get any side effects. Do not just stop taking your medicine.\n\nIs there a vaccine for HIV?\nThere is no vaccine for HIV. This means that the best way to avoid getting HIV is to avoid behaviors that can put you at risk. (See 'How can HIV be prevented?' above.)\n\nWhat if I want to get pregnant?\nIf you want to get pregnant and you have HIV, talk to your doctor. He or she can tell you what you need to know and help you decide what to do.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the adherence-response relationship for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n\nBackground: The effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV is highly dependent on adherence. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are included in many first-line regimens but have relatively low genetic barriers to resistance and have traditionally been thought to require close to perfect adherence for treatment success. There are now many first-line regimens containing drugs with higher barriers to resistance, including integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) but the choice of which regimen to use can be complicated by differences in costs, pill burden, potential side effects, and availability. The adherence threshold for successful viral suppression with NNRTIs is therefore important to assess in order to allow comparisons between treatment options and to inform patient counselling and clinical management. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between adherence to NNRTIs and risk of virologic failure in people living with HIV who are starting cART. Our primary outcome was the proportion of individuals achieving viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/mL) at 48 weeks. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis for the proportion of individuals achieving viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks and at 96 weeks. Results: We identified 21 studies which met our inclusion criteria, with 15 of those providing information on the primary outcome. Among those studies reporting data for the primary outcome, 11 studies reported data for nevirapine and 7 reported data for efavirenz. Adherence thresholds for successful viral suppression ranged from 60 to 100% for nevirapine and from 54 to 95% for efavirenz. Adherence thresholds for successful viral suppression were lower for both NNRTIs at 96 weeks than at 48 weeks. Conclusions: The adherence thresholds for achieving viral suppression at 48 weeks with nevirapine and efavirenz, which are two of the most common first-line NNRTIs, appear to be higher than 60%. These findings may assist with the selection of first-line cART regimens in resource limited settings and with patient counselling and clinical management in all settings.\n\n# Background\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are commonly used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for treatment of people",

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "A systematic review of antiretroviral pharmacokinetics to formulate intersectional guidelines\n\nBackground: Perinatal transmission of HIV is a major public health concern in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review aims to identify the pharmacokinetic evidence regarding antiretroviral therapies (ART) to reduce perinatal transmission in LMICs.Methods:In order to synthesize available pharmacokinetic evidence, we conducted a systematic review to identify studies that reported pharmacokinetic parameters of ART in women living with HIV and/or their neonates in pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. We conducted our search using the terms \"(antiretroviral OR HIV OR AIDS) AND (pharmacokinetics OR PK OR drug level) AND (pregnant OR labour OR breastfeeding) AND (neonate OR infant OR newborn) AND (LMIC OR low income country OR developing country)\". Databases searched include MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We included peer-reviewed, original research published in English since January 1, 2000. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of pharmacokinetic parameters of ART from each study included in this review and compared them to the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in studies of pregnant women in high income countries.Results: Our search yielded 14, 229 studies, of which 35 met our inclusion criteria. We found that efavirenz (EFV) was the most studied drug among non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), with 21 studies reporting maternal and/or neonatal concentrations. For the protease inhibitors (PI), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) was the most studied, with eight studies reporting maternal and/or neonatal concentrations. Zidovudine (ZDV) was the most commonly studied nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), with 13 studies reporting maternal and/or neonatal concentrations. We identified several studies reporting neonatal drug exposure and/or cord:maternal concentration ratios. Overall, we found that studies reported a wide range of pharmacokinetic parameters among pregnant women living with HIV in LMICs. While it is not possible to compare data directly, we identified similar patterns of pharmacokinetic parameters in women in LMICs and high income countries.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a significant gap in the evidence base of ART in pregnancy.

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": ".\n**Cell tropism.** HIV infects CD4 + lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and other tissue cells that have CD4 surface molecules. CD4 cells that express CCR5 on their surface are preferentially infected with macrophage tropic (M-tropic) virus. CD4 cells that express CXCR4 on their surface are preferentially infected with T-trop virus. Cells with both receptors, and with only CXCR4 receptors, are also susceptible to infection.\nHIV-1 infection of CD4 + T cells leads to cellular depletion of both activated and resting CD4 + T cells through direct cytopathic effect of the virus, direct infection-induced apoptosis, and immune-mediated mechanisms. Lymphocyte depletion is the most consistent finding in HIV-infected patients. HIV is cytotoxic to lymphocytes through both cell-to-cell fusion and single cell infection, leading to the production of multinucleated cells called syncytia. HIV-1 and HIV-2 use CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 for cell entry, and viral replication is enhanced by IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6. HIV-2 also uses the CXCR4 chemokine receptor for cell entry.\nHIV infects macrophages, which leads to persistence and virus reservoirs. Macrophages are nondividing cells that can be productively infected with HIV, but their rate of viral replication is low and the viral proteins produced have little cytopathic effect. HIV can remain dormant within macrophages. In addition, the long life of macrophages may result in the maintenance of HIV infection and viral persistence.\nHIV can be transferred from infected macrophages to CD4 + T cells through a process called cell conjugation, and can lead to a burst of viral replication. HIV-infected macrophages produce proinflammatory factors that can also enhance viral replication.\nDendritic cells in mucosal surfaces and lymphoid organs can bind HIV through specific surface molecules and become infected. Infected dendritic cells can then transfer virus to other cells, enhancing viral spread throughout the body.\nIn addition to the immunologic cells that HIV can infect, other cells are involved in HIV pathogenesis through the cytokines and chemokines they produce and through interactions with immunologic cells.",

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": ".\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV infection?\nBecause HIV infection can weaken the immune system, people with HIV are at a higher risk of getting many types of serious infections. They also have a higher risk of certain types of cancer, such as a cancer of the immune system called \"lymphoma.\"\n\nPeople with HIV infection can get very sick and even die from these types of infections and cancers. That's why the government has established a list of infections and cancers that happen more often or are more severe in people with HIV. If you have HIV and get 1 of these infections or cancers, your doctor will say that you have AIDS. This is also known as \"AIDS-defining illness.\"\n\nAIDS is the last stage of HIV infection, and can happen after many years of infection. Still, it is possible to get an AIDS-defining illness soon after getting infected with HIV. The table lists some of the infections and cancers that can happen in people with HIV or AIDS (table 1). Some of these happen in people who have a healthy immune system, but they are usually much milder. In people with a weak immune system, such as people with HIV, they are often more severe and can be fatal.\n\nWhat is the treatment for HIV infection?\nTreatment for HIV infection includes:\n- Antiretroviral therapy (ART): ART involves taking 3 or more HIV medicines. People with HIV need to take these medicines every day. If you do not take them every day, the treatment might not work. If you stop taking them, the virus can come back. If this happens, you can get sick and even die. But if you take ART correctly and it works well, it can help you stay healthy for a very long time.\n- Preventing infections: People with HIV can get very sick or die from infections caused by certain bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. That's why it's important for people with HIV to see their doctor for regular check-ups. Doctors also recommend that people with HIV get vaccines to protect them against common infections. The best way to prevent certain infections is to start HIV treatment as soon as possible.\n- Treating infections: People with HIV are more likely than people without HIV to get certain infections. These can happen even in people who are taking ART.

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "Is it known to be a particular gene mutation or just an environmental trigger? Why do some people live 10+ years with latent infection while others become symptomatic sooner?\nHow does the treatment for HIV evolve from anti-retrovirals to a cure?\nWhat is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection? Is it known to be a particular gene mutation or just an environmental trigger? Why do some people live 10+ years with latent infection while others become symptomatic sooner?\nWhen HIV-1 enters a host, a proportion of infected CD4 cells migrate to lymphoid tissues and undergo a process of transcriptional silencing. This creates a latent reservoir of infected CD4 T-cells that are not susceptible to antiretroviral therapy or immune clearance, and that is a key barrier to HIV-1 eradication. The majority of HIV-1 viral variants are genetically defective and incapable of replicating, although a small portion of HIV-1 proviruses in the latent reservoir can reactivate and replicate, posing a significant barrier to eradication. These latent reservoirs remain in the body even after prolonged antiretroviral therapy, although therapy can reduce the number of latently infected cells.\nScientists do not know what makes the switch that results in the reactivation of the virus. There are some genetic differences between people who progress to active disease quickly and those who do not, but the exact switch that results in the reactivation of the virus is not known. There are also environmental factors that can result in a faster progression from latency to symptomatic infection. It is known that HIV is much more likely to spread if the immune system is compromised due to another disease or infection, such as tuberculosis.\nHow does the treatment for HIV evolve from anti-retrovirals to a cure?\nThere are two main approaches that are being taken to address the latent reservoir and lead to a functional cure: shock and kill and kick and kill.\nShock and kill: In this approach, scientists are studying the use of drugs that reactivate latent viruses (shock). At the same time, patients would continue taking antiretroviral therapy (kill). The hope is that antiretroviral therapy would kill the HIV that is reactivated from latency. Clinical trials are ongoing to test this approach.\nKick and kill: In this approach, scientists would use a drug that kicks HIV out of latency and at the same time, deliver a drug that kills the HIV-infected cells. This approach relies on the body\u2019s immune response",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
