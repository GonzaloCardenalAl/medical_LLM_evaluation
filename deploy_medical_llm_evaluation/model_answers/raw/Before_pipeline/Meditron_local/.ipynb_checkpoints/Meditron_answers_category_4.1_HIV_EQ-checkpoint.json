    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient is presenting with clinical features of cryptococcal meningitis, most likely cryptococcal meningitis. The elevated opening pressure on LP is indicative of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This is an important finding as a significant elevation in ICP has been associated with mortality. Additionally, an opening pressure >25 cm H2O warrants an additional LP to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduce the ICP. This procedure can be repeated until ICP is normalized. If LP is unable to be performed, lumbar drain placement or ventriculostomy may be considered. 1",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "This patient needs to be treated for HIV infection and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. The standard PCP prophylaxis is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). TMP-SMX is also used to treat toxoplasmosis, which is a common infection in AIDS patients. For patients allergic to TMP-SMX, other drugs that can be used for PCP prophylaxis include dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine. TMP-SMX may also be used as prophylaxis for urinary tract infections in female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. TMP-SMX is the preferred treatment of urinary tract infections for patients with pyelonephritis because TMP-SMX is bactericidal and achieves therapeutic levels in the renal parenchyma.\nReference: \nHarrisons Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Page 1587\nThe table below gives the dosage for various regimens using TMP-SMX:\nAnswer: D",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "What is the next step in management?\nThis patient has advanced HIV infection with CD4+T-lymphocyte count < 200/mm3 and severe malnutrition as reflected by BMI < 20 kg/m2. Her symptoms and signs are suggestive of bacillary angiomatosis due to Bartonella henselae, a Gram-negative bacteria. It is transmitted by cat fleas and is an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. Symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. On examination, there are multiple papular and subcutaneous lesions. It is confirmed by biopsy of the lesions that shows the bacilli on Warthin-Starry silver stain. A key finding in this case is the finding of thrush (oral candidiasis), which is an AIDS-defining condition and indicative of CD4+T-lymphocyte count < 200/mm3. Other AIDS-defining conditions in patients with HIV include esophageal candidiasis, histoplasmosis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and tuberculosis. She is severely malnourished as reflected by her BMI and has multiple skin lesions, and biopsy shows vascular proliferation and presence of bacilli in the lesions. This patient is at a high risk for other opportunistic infections due to her low CD4+T-lymphocyte count and severe malnutrition. She is most likely malnourished because of alcohol abuse and/or chronic malabsorption as a result of HIV enteropathy. In addition, she needs evaluation for other opportunistic infections like pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Pharmacotherapy should be started as an outpatient. The first step is to treat the underlying HIV infection. She should be started on a multidrug regimen of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which should be a combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). In addition, treatment of Bacillary angiomatosis includes oral doxycycline for 3 to 4 months.\nThe patient should also be evaluated for other opportunistic infections that can occur in patients with low CD4+T-lymphocyte count and HIV infection.\nThe management of patients with AIDS includes starting combination ART, which is usually a combination of NRTIs and NNRTIs. Other treatment for HIV includes protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2.

An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "(See A Closer Look box below.)\n### Zidovudine\n\n Zidovudine is a thymidine nucleoside analog. It is well absorbed orally, is moderately bound to plasma proteins (20%-40%), and has a half-life of about 1 hour. It is eliminated primarily by renal excretion and the dosage must be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency. Zidovudine can cross the placenta and the blood\u2013brain barrier. It has a moderate to high incidence of adverse effects, especially myelosuppression and, to a lesser extent, headache, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. A Closer Look: HIV/AIDS Pharmacotherapy Zidovudine is a nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Once converted into its active form by intracellular kinases, zidovudine blocks the replication of the virus and also terminates the growth of the proviral DNA chain by incorporating itself at the end of the chain. Zidovudine does not eradicate the virus or cure the disease but it reduces HIV replication and delays progression of disease. However, mutations in HIV's reverse transcriptase can cause resistance to zidovudine and, possibly, to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the drug is always used in combination with other agents. The combination regimen should include a protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Zidovudine was the first drug approved for treating patients with HIV/AIDS. It is a key component of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and after childbirth in order to reduce transmission of the infection from mother to fetus. As with most antiretroviral drugs, zidovudine is not curative. \n## Dideoxyinosine (ddI)\n\n Dideoxyinosine (ddI) is a synthetic purine nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase. It is rapidly absorbed orally, is poorly bound to plasma proteins (10%-15%), and has a half-life of 30\u201360 minutes. It is eliminated by renal excretion, and the dosage should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency. Adverse effects include pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy. The drug can cause lactic acidosis and hepatic failure, particularly in women and patients who are overweight. ddI should not be used in combination with stavudine (d4T), another nucleoside analog",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Explanation: A: HIV infection in a newborn is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be avoided whenever possible. Triple antiretroviral therapy given to the mother during pregnancy decreases the likelihood of vertical transmission of HIV. Because the infant has been exposed to HIV, it should receive antiretroviral therapy. If the mother's viral load is more than 1000 copies/mL or the mother's viral load is unknown at the time of delivery, then a 6-week course of neonatal combination antiretroviral therapy should be given. In this patient, the mother's viral load was less than 1000 copies/mL at delivery. The infant should receive a 2-week course of antiretroviral therapy. This infant was born at 39 weeks' gestation. The delivery was uncomplicated and the infant has no other risk factors for hypoglycemia. The infant is unlikely to develop hypoglycemia (Answer B).
