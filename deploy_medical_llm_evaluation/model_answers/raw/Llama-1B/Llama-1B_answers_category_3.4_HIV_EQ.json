    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, and current presentation of headaches, vertigo, ataxia, apathy, and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum on MRI, along with PCR positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Post-infectious Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**.\n\nPML is a rare but serious condition caused by the reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in individuals with HIV/AIDS, particularly those who have not received effective antiretroviral therapy for a prolonged period. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum on MRI is characteristic of PML, and the positive PCR result supports this diagnosis.\n\nPML is a distinct clinical entity from HIV encephalitis, which is typically characterized by fever, confusion, and altered mental status, in contrast to the patient's presentation of ataxia, apathy, and a focal neurological deficit (the ring-enhancing lesion). The patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy and the lack of response to this treatment are also concerning factors that may have contributed to the development of PML.\n\nPML is often fatal, but with prompt antiviral treatment, the prognosis is generally good. The patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid further support this diagnosis, as PML is typically associated with immune suppression.",

Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, the most likely causal organism is **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**.\n\nThe symptoms and findings are consistent with a herpes simplex keratitis, which is a common manifestation of HSV infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients like this patient. The presence of multiple skin lesions, particularly on the face and extremities, and the patient's history of HIV infection and poor hygiene practices, supports this diagnosis. The rapid plasma reagin test is negative, but the patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low, which may indicate a compromised immune status, but this does not rule out HSV infection. The abdominal ultrasonography findings of hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic hypodense lesion are consistent with a possible liver abscess or abscess, which can be caused by HSV.\n\nThe biopsy of the skin lesion showing vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils further supports the diagnosis of HSV keratitis. It is essential to note that HSV can cause ocular, skin, and visceral lesions, and treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent further complications.",

Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV infection, I would approach this case with caution and consider the potential for opportunistic infections or other conditions related to his immunocompromised state. The patient's symptoms of cough, night sweats, and hazy infiltrate on chest x-ray are concerning for a pulmonary opportunistic infection, specifically Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or possibly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) given his HIV status.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and x-ray findings are consistent with PCP, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients, especially those with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm^3. The presence of a grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur may suggest mitral stenosis, a possible complication of HIV infection, but the more likely cause of his symptoms is the opportunistic infection.\n\nGiven the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse, I would consider the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis, which could contribute to his symptoms and x-ray findings. However, the presence of a hazy infiltrate on the chest x-ray and night sweats are more indicative of PCP.\n\nIt is essential to note that PCP can be a serious and potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection, and prompt treatment is necessary. The patient's HIV status and immunocompromised state make him particularly vulnerable to complications from PCP. The most appropriate initial step would be to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve his immune status and prevent further progression of the infection.",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in the right hand, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Assess for potential causes**: The patient's history of osteoarthritis and hypertension may be relevant, but there's no clear connection to his current symptoms. I would ask more questions to clarify the nature of the weakness.\n2. **Monitor vital signs and laboratory results**: I would order blood work to check for electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes to assess for any acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction, which could be related to his HIV treatment.\n3. **Review medication list**: I would check the patient's medication list to ensure that all medications are being taken as prescribed and that there are no potential drug interactions that could contribute to his symptoms.\n4. **Consider a thorough neurological examination**: I would perform a more detailed neurological examination to assess for any other possible causes of weakness, such as numbness, tingling, or other neurological deficits.\n5. **Consider a physical examination of the right hand**: I would examine the patient's right hand more closely for any signs of trauma, nerve damage, or other abnormalities.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the presence of a history of hypertension, I would also consider the possibility of a cardiac cause, such as a myocardial infarction, and ask about his history of smoking and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn terms of the next step, I would recommend a **cardiac stress test** to evaluate for possible coronary artery disease or cardiac ischemia, and to assess the patient's risk for myocardial infarction. This would be done as an urgent step to rule out any cardiac cause of his symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks' gestation, this patient is at increased risk for certain complications of pregnancy and preterm birth. \n\n1. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening**: Given her age and lack of personal/family history, it's recommended to screen for human papillomavirus (HPV) to assess the risk of cervical cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women, regardless of age, undergo HPV screening at 28 weeks of gestation.\n\n2. **Hepatitis B and C testing**: While the patient is up-to-date on her hepatitis B vaccination, it's still recommended to screen for hepatitis B and C at 28 weeks of gestation to ensure the mother is not infected and to monitor for potential transmission to the fetus.\n\n3. **Blood type and Rh factor screening**: Given the patient's blood type, it's recommended to perform a blood type and Rh factor screening to assess the risk of Rh incompatibility and potential hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\n4. **Genetic counseling**: Given the patient's age and lack of personal/family history, genetic counseling can be provided to discuss the risks of genetic disorders and the importance of preconception counseling.\n\n5. **Vaccinations**: The patient should be up-to-date on her vaccinations, including the flu vaccine, to protect against influenza during pregnancy.\n\n6. **Prenatal care**: A comprehensive prenatal visit is essential to monitor the patient's health, the fetal development, and any potential complications that may arise during pregnancy. This includes discussions about the risks and benefits of preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and potential interventions for any identified issues.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's HIV status is negative, and she is not at increased risk for HIV transmission to the fetus at this visit. However, the patient should continue to receive regular prenatal care to monitor for any potential complications and to discuss any concerns or questions she may have.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Herpes Zoster (Shingles) or possibly a secondary bacterial infection given the presence of black bacteria on the biopsy. However, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be antiviral therapy for Acute Herpes Zoster, as it is a common complication of HIV.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial to prevent further progression to AIDS. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 98/mm3 is adequate, indicating that she is not yet in a severely compromised state.\n\nThe patient's history of intravenous drug use and smoking is a significant risk factor for various infections, including HIV and opportunistic infections. However, the presence of skin lesions and track marks on both cubital fossae may suggest a history of needle sharing or other skin injuries.\n\nThe patient's white patches on her palate and red papules on her face are consistent with oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which can be caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2. The presence of black bacteria on the biopsy suggests a secondary bacterial infection, which could be a bacterial keratitis or a skin infection.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status, antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a protease inhibitor is recommended as the first-line treatment for Acute Herpes Zoster. Other antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir may also be considered, but the choice of medication should be tailored to the patient's specific needs and viral load.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of complications, such as severe pain, vision loss, or skin lesions that do not improve with treatment.",

Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a case of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The presence of numerous painless, flattened, and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus, especially in a person with a history of multiple sexual partners, is highly suggestive of genital warts. The fact that the lesions respond to acetic acid application, which turns them white, is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nHPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause genital warts, and the presence of these lesions is a hallmark of this condition. The fact that the patient has a history of multiple sexual partners increases his risk of acquiring HPV, which is also a risk factor for other conditions such as anal cancer.",

His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, I would approach this case with a high index of suspicion for HIV-related complications, particularly non-infectious causes of kidney damage. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and recent worsening of symptoms, along with his history of poorly controlled HIV, make a plausible diagnosis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) or HIV-related kidney disease.\n\nThe presence of proteinuria (2+ on dipstick) and 1+ pitting edema on physical examination further supports the suspicion of kidney involvement. The patient's obesity and the fact that he is a 37-year-old man with a history of HIV and heroin addiction increase his risk for certain complications.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and risk factors, I would recommend further evaluation to assess kidney function and rule out other potential causes of proteinuria and edema. This could include a urinalysis, blood tests to check kidney function, and a renal ultrasound to evaluate for any signs of kidney damage. \n\nI would also consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is **HIV-associated cardiomyopathy**, specifically **HIV-associated cardiomyopathy with HIV-associated cardiomyopathy with cardiomegaly and endocarditis**.\n\nThe patient's shortness of breath, worsening stairs-climbing ability, and widened mediastinum on the chest x-ray are indicative of cardiac involvement. The patient's HIV status, current antiretroviral therapy, and the presence of a holodiastolic murmur, along with the physical examination findings, support this diagnosis.\n\nTo reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities, the most appropriate therapy would be **HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART)**, specifically **Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)** or **Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)**, and **Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs)**. These medications are effective in managing HIV-related cardiomyopathy, and the patient's current ART regimen should be adjusted to optimize his cardiac function.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should receive **Lopinavir/Atazanavir** (or other NRTIs) and **Rilpivirine** (or other INSTIs) to reduce his viral load and improve his overall health. Regular monitoring of his cardiac function, blood pressure, and lipid profiles will be necessary to adjust his treatment as needed.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and findings suggest that he is at risk of **cardiomyopathy progression**, which can lead to heart failure. Early intervention with ART and lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, may help prevent or slow the progression of the disease.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease, her current presentation of decreased urinary output, and laboratory findings of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium level), the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Hyperkalemic Nephropathy**\n\nHyperkalemia is a common side effect of chemotherapy, particularly with certain drugs such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine. The patient's elevated potassium level is likely due to the toxic effects of these medications on the kidneys, leading to a decrease in potassium excretion and an increase in potassium retention.\n\nThis condition is often referred to as \"chemo-induced nephropathy\" or \"chemo-induced hyperkalemia\". It's essential to note that the patient's kidney function is not significantly impaired, as indicated by the normal creatinine level. However, the patient's potassium level is elevated, and her symptoms of decreased urinary output are consistent with the development of hyperkalemic nephropathy.\n\nThe patient's treatment options for Burkitt's lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease and chemotherapy-induced hyperkalemia may include adjusting the chemotherapy regimen, monitoring potassium levels closely, and considering dialysis or other renal replacement therapies if necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
