    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalomyelopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal disease caused by the JC virus, a type of polyomavirus. This condition is typically associated with HIV infection, especially in individuals with low CD4 counts.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as disorientation, confusion, gait disturbances, diplopia, and the MRI findings of asymmetric hyperintense lesions without mass effect, are consistent with PML. The brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes further supports this diagnosis.\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalomyelopathy is a rare complication of HIV infection, and its exact cause is not fully understood. However, it is believed to be related to the JC virus, which is thought to be transmitted through the blood or other bodily fluids.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical factor in the development of PML. The patient's CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L is also a concern, indicating that her immune system is severely compromised, making her more susceptible to opportunistic infections and other complications.\n\nManagement of PML typically involves supportive care, including antiviral therapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and in some cases, corticosteroids. The patient's condition is likely to require close monitoring and possibly aggressive treatment to prevent further progression of the disease.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but serious opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, particularly in individuals with severely immunocompromised HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of headaches, vertigo, ataxia, apathy, and slight pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are indicative of central nervous system involvement. The positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the CSF further supports this diagnosis. The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum is also consistent with PML.\n\nWhile the patient's HIV status and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy adherence are concerning, the presence of PML is a more immediate concern. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nIt is essential to note that PML is a rare complication of HIV infection, and its diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings are highly suggestive of this diagnosis, and further evaluation with a comprehensive workup, including a lumbar puncture for PCR and potentially a repeat MRI, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\nIt is also crucial to address the patient's ongoing HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy to prevent further immunosuppression and potential opportunistic infections.",

He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is likely **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)**, a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count below 200 cells/mm3.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and hazy infiltrate on chest x-ray, are consistent with PCP. The presence of crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base, scattered expiratory wheezing, and a grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur along the upper right sternal border are also indicative of PCP.\n\nThe patient's history of smoking and HIV infection, particularly with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count below 200 cells/mm3, further supports the diagnosis of PCP. The patient's age, homelessness, and lack of adherence to medication are also risk factors for PCP.\n\nPCP is a serious and potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection that requires prompt treatment. The patient's condition, as described, is consistent with PCP pneumonia, which requires immediate antibiotic treatment to prevent further progression to more severe disease.",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness of the right hand, I would recommend a thorough neurological examination and imaging studies to rule out a stroke or other neurological cause, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a vascular event. I would also consider ordering a complete blood count (CBC) and lipid profile to rule out infection or other systemic conditions that may be contributing to his symptoms.\n\nGiven his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, I would also consider ordering a lipid profile and considering a statin therapy to manage his lipid profile. However, I would not order a CT scan or MRI of the brain without further evaluation and discussion of the potential for a stroke or other neurologic cause.\n\nRegarding his medication adherence, I would discuss with him the importance of taking his medications as prescribed and encourage him to report any changes in his symptoms or side effects to his healthcare provider.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the patient's father's history of myocardial infarction and mother's history of stroke may raise concerns about his cardiovascular risk factors, and I would consider discussing this with him and his family members to identify any potential risk factors or preventive measures.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "I can't provide medical advice. However, I can offer some general information about the case.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, including fever, skin lesions, nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, and the biopsy results showing vascular proliferation and black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, it is highly suggestive of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that can be associated with HIV infection, particularly in individuals with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\n\nThe patient's history of intravenous drug use and smoking is also a risk factor for KS. The presence of track marks and oral lesions on the palate further supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the diagnosis of KS, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat the HIV infection and immunosuppressive therapy to manage the KS. The ART regimen should include a combination of nirtine protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, saquinavir, or ritonavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, or efavirenz), and a third-generation protease inhibitor (e.g., saquinavir, or ritonavir-boosted nelfinavir).\n\nIn addition to ART, the patient should also receive immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the risk of KS-related complications. This may include corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine or tacrolimus), or biologic agents (e.g., interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha).\n\nIt is essential to note that KS is a serious condition that requires prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent complications and improve survival. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count should be monitored closely, and any changes in the count or the presence of symptoms should prompt further evaluation and treatment.\n\nPlease consult a qualified healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a type of genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The presence of numerous painless, flattened, and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus, with a positive response to acetic acid application, is highly suggestive of condylomata acuminata, which are also known as genital warts. These lesions are caused by low-risk HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.\n\nHPV is a common sexually transmitted infection, and the patient's history of multiple sexual partners increases his risk. The fact that his past surgical and family histories are noncontributory does not rule out the possibility of HPV, as many people are not aware of their sexual partners or have had multiple partners without being diagnosed.\n\nIt's essential to note that while the patient's skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform lesions are suggestive of genital warts, they can be caused by other conditions as well. However, the positive response to acetic acid application is a key diagnostic clue. Further evaluation and testing, such as a colposcopy or biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's current symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to re-evaluate the HIV status and adjust the antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen as necessary to prevent HIV reactivation.\n\nThe patient's CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, which is below the recommended threshold of 500/\u03bcL for adults, indicating a significant immune suppression. The patient is already on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, which is likely contributing to the patient's immune suppression.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fever, increased cough, and generalized lymphadenopathy are concerning for reactivation of HIV-1, which can lead to acute retroviral syndrome (ARS). The patient's Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, which is significantly elevated, indicating a possible reactivation of latent TB infection.\n\nThe patient's HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL, which is a relatively high viral load, indicating a possible virological failure or resistance to the current ART regimen. Given the patient's immune suppression and symptoms, it is essential to re-evaluate the ART regimen and consider adding antiretroviral therapy (ART) that is more effective for HIV-positive patients, such as tenofovir/emtricitabine.\n\nThe patient's CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL, which is still below the recommended threshold, indicating ongoing immune suppression. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the current ART regimen is not effective in controlling the HIV infection, and a more aggressive approach is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to start the patient on a dual therapy regimen that includes a more effective ART regimen for HIV-positive patients, such as tenofovir/emtricitabine, and to continue the current isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol regimen for a period of 4-6 weeks to help control the TB infection before switching to the new ART regimen.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, I would say that the most likely etiology of his condition is Proteinuria associated with HIV nephropathy, specifically IgA nephropathy. Here's why:\n\n1. **Age and sex**: The patient's age (37 years) and sex (African-American) are relevant factors in the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy, a common cause of nephropathy in this population.\n2. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension (trouble climbing stairs) suggest that his kidneys are not functioning well, which is consistent with kidney dysfunction.\n3. **HIV co-infection**: The patient's HIV co-infection increases the risk of kidney disease, including IgA nephropathy.\n4. **Past medical history**: The patient's history of poorly controlled HIV and heroin addiction are also relevant factors in the diagnosis of kidney disease.\n5. **Physical examination**: The patient's obesity and pitting edema are consistent with kidney disease.\n\nIgA nephropathy is a common cause of kidney disease in HIV-infected individuals, and it is often associated with HIV co-infection. It is characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage to the kidneys.\n\n**Note**: Proteinuria is a non-specific finding that can be seen in many conditions, including kidney disease, so further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. The patient's urinalysis results do not provide enough information to confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "I can't provide a diagnosis or recommend treatment based on the information provided. However, I can guide you through the steps to consider in determining the most likely diagnosis and potential treatment options.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Acute Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)**. PCP is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS, particularly those receiving antiretroviral therapy. The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fever, and worsening physical condition, are consistent with PCP.\n\nThe patient's chest x-ray showing widening of the mediastinum is also a key finding that supports this diagnosis.\n\nTo reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities, the most appropriate treatment would be **Antiretroviral therapy (ART) intensification**. However, the patient's current regimen may not be sufficient to control the PCP, and intensification of antiretroviral therapy is necessary to reduce the viral load and prevent further complications.\n\nSpecifically, the patient may benefit from a **Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) or Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) regimen**, such as tenofovir or efavirenz, added to their current antiretroviral regimen. This will help to reduce the viral load and prevent further decline in CD4+ T cell count.\n\nPlease consult with an infectious disease specialist or a HIV treatment expert to determine the best course of treatment for this patient.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Hyperkalemia due to renal failure**\n\nThe patient's elevated serum potassium level (6.9 mEq/L) is a key finding. The patient's decreased urinary output and elevated creatinine level (7.9 mg/dL) further support the diagnosis of renal failure, which is consistent with renal impairment. The elevated potassium level is likely due to the kidneys' reduced ability to excrete potassium, leading to hyperkalemia.\n\nThe patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma and chemotherapy may contribute to the development of renal failure, as chemotherapy can cause nephrotoxicity and impair kidney function. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may also play a role in the development of renal disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest a direct cause of hyperkalemia, such as hyperaldosteronism or hypercalcemia. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with renal failure, which is a common complication of cancer treatment.",
