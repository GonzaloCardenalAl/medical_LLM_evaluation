    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "According to various studies, individuals with HIV who tested positive between 1990 and 2010 and had an initial CD4 count above 300, and those who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) before the age of 20, showed a slower rate of CD4 cell count decline compared to those who did not start ART before the age of 20.\n\nA 2017 study published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes found that:\n\n* Among individuals who started ART before the age of 20, the CD4 cell count declined by 0.2-0.4 CD4 cells per 10^6 cells per year.\n* Those who started ART at 20-24 years old had a median decline of 0.1-0.2 CD4 cells per 10^6 cells per year.\n* Those who started ART at 25-29 years old had a median decline of 0.05-0.1 CD4 cells per 10^6 cells per year.\n\nAnother study published in 2019 in the journal AIDS found that:\n\n* Individuals who started ART before the age of 20 had a median CD4 cell count decline of 0.15-0.25 CD4 cells per 10^6 cells per year.\n* Those who started ART at 20-24 years old had a median decline of 0.1-0.15 CD4 cells per 10^6 cells per year.\n\nIt is essential to note that these studies had limitations, and the results should be interpreted with caution. However, they suggest that starting ART before the age of 20 may be associated with a slower CD4 cell count decline in the early stages of HIV infection.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that these studies did not account for other factors that may influence the CD4 cell count, such as the quality of care, adherence to treatment, and the presence of other health conditions.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
