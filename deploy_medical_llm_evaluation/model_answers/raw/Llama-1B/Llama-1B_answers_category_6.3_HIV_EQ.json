    "answer": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the overall birth rate in Switzerland in 2020 was approximately 1,053 births per 1,000 population, with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.4 children per woman.\n\nRegarding HIV transmission and birth rates, the WHO states that \"there is no evidence to suggest that HIV is transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\" However, the WHO also notes that HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during breastfeeding.\n\nIt's worth noting that the majority of HIV-positive women in Switzerland are HIV-positive due to mother-to-child transmission, and the risk of transmission is generally considered low. However, if a mother is HIV-positive and is receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), the risk of transmission is significantly reduced.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, I'd be happy to help.",
