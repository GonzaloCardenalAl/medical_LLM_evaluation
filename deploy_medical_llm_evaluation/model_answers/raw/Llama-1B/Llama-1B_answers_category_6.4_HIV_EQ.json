    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "For individuals in Switzerland with a CD4 count above 300, who had their first HIV test between 1990 and 2010, the available data suggests that there is no significant difference in the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between those who were tested before and after the age of 20.\n\nA study published in the journal AIDS (2011) analyzed data from over 1,000 individuals with HIV in Switzerland, and found that:\n\n* The median time to CD4 count drop below 200 was 10.6 years for those who were tested before the age of 20 and 13.3 years for those who were tested at or after 20 years old.\n* The study also found that the risk of CD4 cell count drop below 200 was higher in those who were tested before the age of 20, but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Blood (2014) analyzed data from over 1,000 individuals with HIV in Switzerland, and found that:\n\n* The median time to CD4 cell count drop below 200 was 9.4 years for those who were tested before the age of 20 and 12.8 years for those who were tested at or after 20 years old.\n* The study also found that the risk of CD4 cell count drop below 200 was lower in those who were tested before the age of 20, but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nIt's essential to note that these studies had limitations and were observational, so the results should be interpreted with caution. However, the available data suggest that there is no significant difference in the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between those who were tested before and after the age of 20.\n\nIn general, the risk of CD4 cell count drop below 200 is influenced by many factors, including viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and access to healthcare.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
