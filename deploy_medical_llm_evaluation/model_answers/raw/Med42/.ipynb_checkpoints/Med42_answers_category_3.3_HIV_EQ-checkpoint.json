    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Toxoplasmosis\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Central nervous system lymphoma\n\nAnswer: 2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, and MRI findings of asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions without mass effect are highly suggestive of PML. The brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes further supports this diagnosis. PML is a rare but severe complication of HIV infection, caused by JC virus reactivation in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy has likely contributed to her immunosuppression and increased risk for PML. While HAND, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and CNS lymphoma are all potential complications of HIV, the specific imaging and biopsy findings in this case point to PML as the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "1. Lipodystrophy syndrome\n2. Hyperglycemia\n3. Hepatotoxicity\n4. Nephrotoxicity\n5. Anemia\n\nAnswer: 1. Lipodystrophy syndrome\n\nExplanation: The patient is being treated with a combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a protease inhibitor (PI). Indinavir, a PI, is known to cause lipodystrophy syndrome, characterized by changes in body fat distribution, including increased visceral fat, buffalo hump, and facial wasting. This side effect is more commonly associated with older PIs like indinavir, which is now less frequently used due to newer, better-tolerated options. The other options are potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy, but they are not specifically linked to indinavir or the combination prescribed here. Hyperglycemia can occur with PIs, but it's not the most significant risk in this case. Hepatotoxicity is a concern with some antiretrovirals, particularly nevirapine, but not typically with lamivudine, zidovudine, or indinavir. Nephrotoxicity is more commonly associated with tenofovir, which is not part of this regimen. Anemia can occur with zidovudine, but it's not the primary concern here given the patient's overall presentation and treatment.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\nAnswer: 3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV, inconsistent medication adherence, and recent improvement in adherence, along with neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy), and cognitive impairment (MMSE score 15/30), suggest a central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infection or malignancy. The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, along with positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, strongly points toward primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is an AIDS-defining condition and commonly associated with EBV infection. The other options do not fit as well with the imaging and CSF findings: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder would not typically present with a focal lesion; toxoplasmosis might show multiple lesions, not a single large one; cryptococcal meningitis would likely present with more pronounced CSF abnormalities and possibly hydrocephalus; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy would show multifocal white matter lesions, not a solitary enhancing mass.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

Legionella pneumophila\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, laboratory findings, and chest x-ray, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae (option 2). Here's why:\n\n- The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n- The presence of crackles over the right lower lung base on physical examination supports this diagnosis.\n- The chest x-ray showing a right lower-lobe infiltrate further confirms pneumonia.\n- The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 520/mm\u00b3, which is within the normal range for an HIV-positive individual on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests that his immune system is not severely compromised, making opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii less likely.\n- The patient's smoking history and lack of specific risk factors for Legionella pneumophila (e.g., recent travel, water exposure) make Legionella less probable.\n- Haemophilus influenzae is possible but less common in adults, especially without a history of recent influenza or underlying conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n- Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unlikely given the acute presentation and lack of chronic symptoms or risk factors for TB exposure.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, especially in smokers, and fits best with the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.",

    "answer": "1. Toxoplasma gondii\n2. Cryptococcus neoformans\n3. Bartonella henselae\n4. Mycobacterium avium complex\n5. Histoplasma capsulatum\n\nAnswer: 3. Bartonella henselae\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV infection, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and low CD4+ count (180/mm3) indicate immunosuppression. The clinical presentation of multiple painless, friable skin nodules, hepatomegaly, and a hypodense liver lesion on ultrasonography are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis, a condition caused by Bartonella henselae. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils also support this diagnosis. While other opportunistic infections could be considered, the specific skin and liver manifestations, along with biopsy results, make B. henselae the most likely causal organism.",

    "answer": "1. Cryptosporidiosis\n2. Microsporidiosis\n3. Giardiasis\n4. Isosporiasis\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, HIV status, and lab results, the most likely diagnosis is Cryptosporidiosis (Option 1). Here's why:\n\n1. Watery diarrhea: Cryptosporidiosis is known for causing profuse, watery diarrhea, which aligns with the patient's primary complaint.\n2. HIV-positive with low CD4+ count: Cryptosporidium is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly infects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with CD4+ counts below 200/mm3 (in this case, 88/mm3).\n3. Non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy: This could have contributed to the patient's immunosuppressed state, making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections like Cryptosporidiosis.\n4. Right upper quadrant pain: While not specific to Cryptosporidiosis, this symptom could be related to biliary involvement, which is sometimes seen in Cryptosporidium infections.\n5. Pending stool microscopy: Although results are not yet available, Cryptosporidium oocysts can be identified in stool samples using microscopy, providing a definitive diagnosis.\n\nWhile Microsporidiosis, Giardiasis, and Isosporiasis are also potential causes of diarrhea in HIV-positive patients, Cryptosporidiosis is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's specific presentation and lab findings.",

The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "250 patients with confirmed AIDS, 240 positive screening examination, 250 control patients, 5 positive screening examination\n\nTo calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to determine the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) from the given data.\n\nTrue Negatives (TN): These are patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. Since 250 control patients do not have AIDS and 5 of them tested positive, that means 250 - 5 = 245 patients are true negatives.\n\nFalse Negatives (FN): These are patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. Out of 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, 240 tested positive, so 250 - 240 = 10 patients are false negatives.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV \u2248 0.961 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 96.1%, indicating that if a patient tests negative, there is about a 96.1% probability that they do not have AIDS, based on this study's data.",

Fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), which indicates severe immunosuppression, the appropriate additional medications for prophylaxis are:\n\n1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis: Yes, this is necessary due to the high risk of PJP in patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3. The standard prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\n2. Toxoplasma gondii prophylaxis: Yes, this is also recommended for patients with CD4+ counts below 100 cells/mm3, as in this case. TMP-SMX, used for PJP prophylaxis, is also effective against Toxoplasma gondii, so no additional medication is needed specifically for toxoplasmosis.\n\n3. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis: Yes, this is indicated for patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm3, which applies to our patient. Azithromycin is the preferred agent for MAC prophylaxis.\n\n4. Fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis: No, routine prophylaxis for Candida is not recommended in HIV patients, even with low CD4+ counts. However, if the patient has a history of invasive candidiasis or recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, fluconazole may be considered for secondary prophylaxis.\n\nIn summary, the patient should receive TMP-SMX for PJP and Toxoplasma prophylaxis, and azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis.

Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "1. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n2. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 4 weeks\n3. Administer nevirapine to the infant for 6 weeks\n4. Administer lamivudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n5. No antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant\n\nAnswer: 1. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n\nExplanation: Given the mother's HIV status and her viral load being under control (678 copies/mL) due to triple antireviral therapy during pregnancy, the infant is at reduced risk for vertical transmission but not zero risk. Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant using zidovudine for 6 weeks to further minimize transmission risk. This is based on evidence from studies showing the efficacy of zidovudine in preventing mother-to-child transmission when combined with maternal antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. The other options (2, 3, 4) are not supported by current guidelines for this specific scenario, and option 5 (no prophylaxis) would not be appropriate given the ongoing risk of transmission despite maternal treatment.",

    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neuropathy\n2. Vitamin B12 deficiency\n3. Peripheral neuropathy due to chronic diarrhea\n4. Peripheral neuropathy due to malnutrition\n\nAnswer: 2. Vitamin B12 deficiency\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of numbness in the hands and feet, along with the physical exam findings of decreased 2-point discrimination, absent ankle reflexes, and ataxic gait, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. The patient's history of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition, as well as the erythematous and smooth tongue with loss of papillae, suggest a high likelihood of vitamin B12 deficiency. HIV-associated neuropathy is possible, but it typically presents with more widespread and symmetric symptoms, and the patient's lack of antiretroviral therapy does not necessarily imply that HIV is the primary cause of his neuropathy.

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500).

The presence of fever, night sweats, and a holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration along the left sternal border (consistent with tricuspid regurgitation) strongly suggest infective endocarditis, particularly in the context of intravenous drug use. The elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate also support an infectious process. While other options like pneumonia, tuberculosis, lymphoma, or toxoplasmosis could be considered, the specific combination of symptoms and findings in this case points more toward endocarditis as the primary diagnosis.",

    "answer": "1. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n2. Membranous nephropathy\n3. Minimal change disease\n4. IgA nephropathy\n5. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)\n\nAnswer: 1. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n\nExplanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including progressive leg swelling, unintentional weight gain, and proteinuria, suggests nephrotic syndrome. The decreased albumin level and elevated cholesterol level further support this diagnosis. Given the patient's HIV status, the most likely finding on kidney biopsy under light microscopy is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is a common pattern of injury associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN typically presents with nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive renal failure, and FSGS is the characteristic histopathological pattern seen in this condition. The other options are less likely given the patient's HIV status and clinical presentation.  2. Membranous nephropathy is typically associated with autoimmune diseases or infections other than HIV, and the patient's history does not suggest these conditions. 3. Minimal change disease is more common in children and typically presents with a sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's progressive symptoms over 2 months. 4. IgA nephropathy is not typically associated with HIV infection and would not explain the patient's other symptoms such as numbness and cramping. 5. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the underlying condition, but the specific histopathological pattern expected on kidney biopsy is FSGS.",

    "answer": "1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n2. Tuberculosis\n3. Bacterial pneumonia\n4. Pulmonary embolism\n5. Congestive heart failure\n\nBased on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of his symptoms is bacterial pneumonia (option 3). Here's why:\n\n- The patient's HIV status with a low CD4+ count (280/mm3) puts him at risk for opportunistic infections, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (option 1) typically presents with more diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, not localized to one lung field.\n- Tuberculosis (option 2) is possible given the patient's immunocompromised state, but the acute presentation with fever, night sweats, and localized infiltrate on x-ray is less typical for TB, which often presents more insidiously.\n- Pulmonary embolism (option 4) is unlikely given the absence of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (e.g., recent immobilization) and the presence of crackles and wheezing on physical examination, which are more indicative of a parenchymal lung process.\n- Congestive heart failure (option 5) could contribute to respiratory symptoms, but the localized infiltrate on x-ray and the presence of malodorous phlegm suggest a primary lung infection rather than heart failure.\n- Bacterial pneumonia (option 3) fits best with the patient's symptoms, including coughing up phlegm, fever, night sweats, and localized infiltrate on x-ray. The patient's smoking history, alcohol abuse, and lack of medication adherence further increase his risk for bacterial infections.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a complex patient with multiple comorbidities, and a definitive diagnosis may require further diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures, sputum analysis, and possibly a CT scan of the chest.

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "1. HIV screening\n2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)\n3. Hepatitis C antibody\n4. Syphilis serology\n5. Rubella IgG\n6. Varicella IgG\n7. Urinalysis\n8. Complete blood count (CBC)\n9. Blood type and Rh status\n10. Glucose challenge test (GCT)\n\nAs a senior physician, my response to the patient's question would be: At this prenatal visit, the following tests should be performed:\n1. HIV screening: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend routine HIV screening during pregnancy to ensure the health of both the mother and the fetus.\n2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Screening for HBsAg is essential during pregnancy, as hepatitis B can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vaccination of the newborn is recommended if the mother is positive.\n3. Syphilis serology: Syphilis screening is a standard component of prenatal care, as untreated syphilis can lead to severe fetal complications.\n4. Rubella IgG: Ensuring immunity to rubella (German measles) is crucial, as infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome. If not immune, vaccination postpartum is recommended.\n5. Varicella IgG: Similar to rubella, checking for varicella immunity helps prevent potential complications in the fetus. If not immune, vaccination postpartum is advised.\n6. Urinalysis: A routine urinalysis is performed to detect any asymptomatic urinary tract infections or proteinuria, which can be indicative of preeclampsia later in pregnancy.\n7. Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC helps identify any underlying anemia or other hematologic abnormalities.\n8. Blood type and Rh status: Determining blood type and Rh status is essential for managing potential complications related to blood group incompatibility between mother and fetus.\n9. Glucose challenge test (GCT): Although not typically performed at the first prenatal visit, it may be considered if there are risk factors for gestational diabetes, such as obesity or a family history of diabetes. However, in this case, the patient's BMI is within normal limits, and there is no family history of diabetes, so the GCT might be deferred until later in pregnancy (usually around 24-28 weeks).\n\nHepatitis C antibody testing is not universally recommended during pregnancy but may be considered if there are specific risk factors, such as a history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions before 1992. In this case, the patient has no such risk factors, so hepatitis C testing is not indicated.",

Condyloma Acuminata\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of painless, skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform lesions in genital and perianal areas, along with a positive response to 5% acetic acid (turning white), is highly suggestive of Condyloma Acuminata, also known as genital warts. These lesions are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11. The patient's HIV status and multiple sexual partners increase his risk for acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HPV.\n\nSyphilis (1) would typically present with a painless chancre (primary stage) or a rash (secondary stage), neither of which matches the described lesions. HSV (2) would present with painful vesicles or ulcers, not papilliform lesions. Molluscum Contagiosum (4) is a poxvirus infection that causes small, dome-shaped, and umbilicated lesions, not papilliform ones. Lichen Planus (5) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that does not typically present with genital or perianal papilliform lesions.",

Peripheral blood smear with Prussian blue staining.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's symptoms and lab results suggest anemia, which is supported by the low hemoglobin level (9.2 g/dL) and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 75 \u00b5m\u00b3, indicating microcytic anemia. The presence of Pappenheimer bodies on the peripheral smear further points toward iron overload or sideroblastic anemia. Prussian blue staining is a specific test for detecting intracellular iron deposits, which would confirm sideroblastic anemia or hemoglobinopathy with siderosis in this context.\n\nWhile bone marrow biopsy (option 1) could provide additional information, it is an invasive procedure and not the most accurate or first-line test for diagnosing sideroblastic anemia or iron overload in this case. Serum iron studies (option 2) might show elevated iron levels, but they are nonspecific and do not directly visualize intracellular iron deposits. Genetic testing for hemochromatosis (option 3) is not indicated here, as the patient's presentation and lab findings are more consistent with sideroblastic anemia secondary to another condition (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome) rather than primary hemochromatosis.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)\n2. Hypertension-induced nephrosclerosis\n3. Hepatitis C-related glomerulonephritis\n4. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity\n5. Obesity-related glomerulopathy\n\nBased on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has poorly controlled HIV, which increases the risk of developing HIVAN. HIVAN is a common complication of untreated or poorly controlled HIV, particularly in African-Americans.\n2. The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, and difficulty climbing stairs, are consistent with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, which is a hallmark of HIVAN.\n3. The presence of 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities suggests fluid retention, which is often seen in CKD and HIVAN.\n4. The 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick is another key indicator of kidney damage, specifically glomerular injury, which is characteristic of HIVAN.\n5. While hypertension-induced nephrosclerosis (option 2) could contribute to kidney damage, the patient's blood pressure is not significantly elevated, making this less likely as the primary cause.\n6. Hepatitis C-related glomerulonephritis (option 3) is unlikely given the absence of any mention of hepatitis C infection in the patient's history.\n7. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity (option 4) is also less likely, as there is no specific medication mentioned that could be causing kidney damage in this context.\n8. Obesity-related glomerulopathy (option 5) might contribute to kidney disease, but it is less specific to the patient's HIV status and proteinuria, making HIVAN a more plausible explanation.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's poorly controlled HIV, symptoms consistent with CKD, and proteinuria, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of his condition.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most accurate test to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. Echocardiogram\n2. CT scan of the chest\n3. Blood cultures\n4. Bronchoscopy with biopsy\n5. HIV viral load\n\nThe most accurate test to confirm the diagnosis in this case would be a CT scan of the chest (option 2). The patient's symptoms, particularly shortness of breath and inability to climb stairs, along with the fever and holodiastolic murmur, suggest possible endocarditis or a mediastinal mass, such as lymphoma. The widened mediastinum on chest x-ray further supports this suspicion. A CT scan of the chest would provide detailed imaging to identify any mediastinal masses or cardiac involvement, such as vegetations on heart valves, which would be indicative of endocarditis.\n\nAn echocardiogram (option 1) could be useful in evaluating cardiac structures and function, but it may not provide the same level of detail regarding mediastinal masses as a CT scan. Blood cultures (option 3) would be essential in diagnosing endocarditis, but they are not the most accurate test for confirming the overall diagnosis in this case, as they only identify the causative organism. Bronchoscopy with biopsy (option 4) would be more relevant for lung pathology, not mediastinal or cardiac issues. Lastly, HIV viral load (option 5) is important for monitoring HIV treatment adherence and disease progression, but it does not directly address the current symptoms or suspected diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What therapy is most likely to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "1. Hemodialysis\n2. Allopurinol\n3. Rasburicase\n4. Intravenous fluids\n5. Sodium bicarbonate\n\nThe correct answer is 1. Hemodialysis.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's lab results indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and elevated creatinine and BUN levels. These findings are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of chemotherapy in patients with bulky lymphoma. Hemodialysis is the most effective therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities by removing excess uric acid, potassium, and other waste products from the blood. Allopurinol and rasburicase are medications used to prevent TLS by reducing uric acid production or breaking down uric acid, respectively, but they are not effective in reversing established TLS. Intravenous fluids may help maintain hydration but are insufficient to correct the severe metabolic derangements. Sodium bicarbonate may be used to treat acidosis but is not the primary therapy for TLS.",
