    "question": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?",
    "answer": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients? Why?\nAtherosclerosis and its clinical manifestation (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease) are common comorbidities among persons living with HIV (PLHIV). Even though, the relative risk for CVD is higher for PLHIV compared to the general population, the absolute risk is low. However, as PLHIV are living longer, it is anticipated that their risk for atherosclerosis will increase, and eventually approach the rates of the general population. In addition, in this patient population, atherosclerotic plaques show a higher lipid content and are more prone to rupture, while also atheroma in multiple vessels have been reported. Despite these considerations, the role of atherosclerosis as a determinant of CVD is still under debate in PLHIV. Indeed, atheroma rupture is less common, the role of thrombosis is limited, and even the role of traditional CVD risk factors is not clear.\nIt is worth mentioning that in PLHIV, the coexistence of CVD with other diseases, such as HIV-related neoplasia, HIV-related cognitive impairment, as well as opportunistic and other HIV-related infections, should be taken into account. In these cases, risk estimates obtained by the risk assessment charts (e.g. SCORE2) are probably an underestimate of the real CVD risk. Moreover, although PLHIV are at higher risk of CVD compared to the general population, it is not clear whether all of them are at increased risk and should be treated with statins, as most studies that assessed the impact of statins on PLHIV have not provided significant results. Based on this, it is crucial to correctly identify the high-risk patients for CVD in the PLHIV population. This can be done by incorporating HIVrelated parameters into the risk assessment charts.\nRegarding the two cases, we have no information on whether the 54-year-old woman and man are antiretroviral therapy-na\u00efve, have received therapy and discontinued, or are currently on antiretroviral treatment. Also, we have no information on CD4 cell counts and viral load. As the current risk estimates do not take into account the aforementioned HIV-related parameters, the role of the antiretroviral drugs used and the presence of other infections, we cannot make a reliable recommendation on whether to incorporate statin therapy in these patients.\nHowever, as these patients are middle-aged, have multiple CVD risk factors and do not receive a statin",
    "true_answer": "Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended."

    "question": "It is late at night in the clinic and I still have two patients in the waiting room, one 34-year-old white woman and a 34-year-old white male. I only have time to attend one of them. Who should I attend?",
    "answer": "It is late at night in the clinic and I still have two patients in the waiting room, one 34-year-old white woman and a 34-year-old white male. I only have time to attend one of them. Who should I attend? The ethical issue is about the allocation of scarce resources. This is a controversial topic and a number of ethical approaches can be used. One is a utilitarian approach which holds that the best action is the one that maximizes well-being. In the clinical scenario, this would involve attending the woman first, because she has a higher life expectancy (81.2 years) than the man (76.2 years). She will therefore derive more well-being from a long life than a man, as the difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States is 5.0 years. This will give her more time to fulfil her desires and projects. In the utilitarian view, this will maximize well-being in the clinic.\nBut utilitarianism also entails that scarce resources (like my time) should be allocated to those who will derive the most benefit. As the man is more likely to die before the age of 75 years (17.1% vs. 7.6%) and therefore, will have less remaining life expectancy, he will have a greater relative health gain if he is treated before the woman. His treatment should take precedence over the woman's treatment.\nHowever, I could also decide to treat the man first because he is more likely to have a disability (13.3% vs. 10.6%), or because he is more likely to be obese (37.8% vs. 34.1%) or smoke (23.9% vs. 19.4%). He is therefore less healthy than the woman and he should therefore have precedence in treatment. A utilitarian would not be able to decide between these alternatives.\nI could use another ethical approach, such as fairness or justice. I could treat the patient who arrived first in the clinic, or who has waited longer. I could also treat the patient who has the most children or relatives who are dependent upon him or her. However, as there are no data available about these, I am unable to use this approach.\nI could take a different approach and treat the patient who has the most medical need. As there is no information available on their clinical presentation, I am unable to use this approach.\nAnother approach is that it is unfair to use social utility as the basis of decision-making, and a purely random selection method should be used.\nThe example above shows that health information at the individual level, such as medical needs, is not available for making an ethical decision about who should be treated first. Health information at the population level, such as life expectancy,",

    "question": "Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity?",
    "answer": "Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity? No, new research suggests. According to a recent study, the high incidence of HIV infection among blacks is mostly due to socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of the disease among their sex partners.\nA recent study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins University finds that while sexual mixing among ethnic groups is a factor in the disparity, socioeconomic factors are much more important. According to Johns Hopkins, \"The high prevalence of HIV in black communities means that black people who have the same number and type of sexual partners as whites still face a greater chance of being exposed to the virus because of their higher risk of having a sexual partner living with HIV.\"\nThe study was based on a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, examining the sexual risk behaviors of blacks and whites with a focus on their risk of HIV exposure, not just HIV infection. The researchers also analyzed data from the National Survey of Family Growth (2002), focusing on 3,042 black and white men and women between the ages of 15 and 44.\nThe researchers analyzed data from a group of participants who had never been tested for HIV and therefore assumed to be HIV-negative. The study measured whether blacks have more high-risk sexual behaviors than whites and compared the exposure to HIV that each racial group faces by examining factors such as condom use, sexually transmitted infections, and the number of partners in a given year.\nResults show that black participants were no more likely than whites to engage in risky sexual behaviors but that blacks were more likely than whites to have partners who are HIV-positive or at a high risk for HIV. In fact, blacks were found to have 1.33 times the exposure to HIV as whites, meaning that HIV-negative black people are one-third more likely to have unprotected sex with someone living with HIV than HIV-negative white people.\n\"We have known for some time that there is a higher risk of HIV infection among African Americans, and that risk cannot be explained away just by differences in sexual behavior,\" said Dr. David Holtgrave, chair of the Department of Health, Behavior and Society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and one of the study's authors. \"In fact, this new study shows that much of the elevated risk is related to the HIV prevalence in the pools of potential partners from which black people chose their partners. The study also suggests that sexual mixing between black and white people plays a lesser role.\"\nThe study was published in the September issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes.\nTo read the Johns Hopkins University press release, click here.\nFor a",

The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis? A. Primary HIV infection B. Primary syphilis C. Primary gonorrhea D. Primary chlamydia E. Disseminated Lyme disease\n**Understanding the Presentation**\n\nThe patient presents with a unique combination of symptoms that require careful consideration. The presence of an erythema migrans rash is a critical clue, as it is a characteristic feature of Lyme disease. This rash typically appears 3-30 days after a tick bite and is often accompanied by systemic symptoms.\n\n**Systemic Symptoms**\n\nThe patient's fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and low-grade fever are consistent with the early disseminated stage of Lyme disease. These symptoms can be non-specific but, when combined with the erythema migrans rash, point towards a diagnosis of Lyme disease.\n\n**Cardiac Involvement**\n\nThe patient's palpitations and dizziness are concerning for cardiac involvement, which is a known complication of Lyme disease. Lyme carditis can occur in the early disseminated stage, typically presenting with symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath.\n\n**Other Possible Diagnoses**\n\nWhile the patient's recent unprotected anal receptive intercourse raises the possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the presence of an erythema migrans rash and the systemic symptoms are more suggestive of Lyme disease. Primary HIV infection, primary syphilis, primary gonorrhea, and primary chlamydia do not typically present with an erythema migrans rash.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the presence of an erythema migrans rash, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated Lyme disease.\n\n### Answer:\nE. Disseminated Lyme disease",
    "true_answer": "These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis."

Her risk of CVD guides this decision. D. No, this regimen is not safe. Her risk of CVD guides this decision.\n### Answer:\nB. No, this regimen is not safe. Her positive HLA-B*57:01 status guides this decision.\n**Explanation:**\nABC (Abacavir) should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*5701 because of risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. (Ref: Katzung 13th ed. / 910-911, 936)\n**Abacavir:**\n* It is a guanosine analogue. It is converted to carbovir triphosphate intracellularly.\n* Abacavir inhibits reverse transcriptase and terminates the growing DNA chain.\n* It is active against HIV-1 and HIV-2.\n* It is well absorbed orally and is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine.\n* The most important adverse effect of abacavir is hypersensitivity.\n* **A severe hypersensitivity reaction develops in about 5% of patients receiving abacavir. The symptoms include fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and hypotension.**\n* **Hypersensitivity symptoms can begin within hours of reexposure in patients who have previously undergone abacavir desensitization, but the median time to onset is about 9 days.**\n* **Patients who develop a hypersensitivity reaction should permanently discontinue the drug.**\n* **Abacavir is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency.**\n**Precautions before starting abacavir:**\n* **A screening test for the HLA-B*5701 allele is performed prior to starting therapy. Patients with this allele are at high risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir.**\n* **Screening for hepatitis B infection should be performed prior to initiating therapy with abacavir because this drug may have a limited effect on HIV/HBV-coinfected patients and discontinuation of abacavir in coinfected patients may be associated with clinical progression of hepatitis B.**",

    "answer": "A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation. The blood test indicated HIV-VL > 50,000 copies/mL. Is it appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy? Answer: C\nThe following is an explanation for answer C (dual therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is inappropriate for patients with high viral loads):\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and fusion inhibitors.\n- The basic ART regimen for HIV infection is a combination of NRTIs with a third class of drugs such as NNRTIs, PIs, or fusion inhibitors.\n- The regimen can be initiated with two NRTIs and one NNRTI, one PI or fusion inhibitor, or two PIs. \n- For patients with a high viral load or with advanced AIDS, dual therapy with two NRTIs is inappropriate. \n- There is a high incidence of side effects among patients treated with two NRTIs and PIs, and treatment should be continued for a long period. Therefore, when initiating ART, we recommend dual therapy with two NRTIs and one NNRTI.",
    "true_answer": "XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy."

Phenytoin is a hydantoin derivative and inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels [bib_ref] Epilepsy in the elderly: mechanisms, consequences, and treatment, Stefan [/bib_ref]. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 1.2 million people live with HIV and around 36,900 new cases of HIV are diagnosed each year. In the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), there were more than 1.6 million people living with HIV in 2019. HIV and epilepsy are closely related, and their prevalence is high. The prevalence of epilepsy in HIV-positive patients is reported to be up to 50% higher compared to the general population [bib_ref] Epilepsy and HIV: a retrospective analysis of 10-year experience from a tertiary..., Sibiya [/bib_ref]. Moreover, both HIV and epilepsy are associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders [bib_ref] Psychiatric disorders among epileptic patients at a referral center in Saudi Arabia, Aldosari [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among outpatients with HIV infection in..., Peng [/bib_ref]. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) between HIV drugs and other concomitant drugs are common [bib_ref] Drug-drug interactions in the treatment of HIV-infected patients, Mastrolorenzo [/bib_ref]. As in the case of phenytoin, some antiepileptic drugs are potent inducers of the enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP).
