Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing? \n**HIV Life Cycle and Envelope Proteins**\n\nHIV, the causative agent of AIDS, has a complex life cycle involving several viral proteins. The viral envelope proteins are crucial for the entry of the virus into host cells.\n\n### HIV Envelope Proteins\n\nThe HIV envelope proteins consist of two main proteins: gp120 and gp41.\n\n- **gp120**: This protein is responsible for binding to the host cell CD4 receptor and co-receptors, facilitating the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n- **gp41**: This protein forms a trimer and is involved in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n\n### HIV Life Cycle\n\nThe HIV life cycle can be divided into several steps:\n\n1.  **Viral Entry**: The viral envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41) bind to the host cell CD4 receptor and co-receptors, facilitating the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n2.  **Uncoating**: The viral capsid is uncoated, releasing the viral genome into the host cell.\n3.  **Reverse Transcription**: The viral genome is reverse transcribed into a complementary DNA (cDNA) copy.\n4.  **Integration**: The viral cDNA is integrated into the host cell genome.\n5.  **Transcription**: The viral cDNA is transcribed into mRNA.\n6.  **Translation**: The mRNA is translated into viral proteins.\n7.  **Assembly**: The viral proteins are assembled into new viral particles.\n8.  **Budding**: The new viral particles are released from the host cell through budding.\n\n### Antibody Target\n\nThe natural humoral immune response against HIV targets the viral envelope proteins. The physician scientist is designing an antibody to target the same proteins. The most likely target of this antibody is the HIV envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41).\n\n### Answer:\nC. gp41",

Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism? Aspergillus fumigatus \n**Aspergillus spp**.\nAspergillus spp. are ubiquitous in the environment and are responsible for four main disease entities: aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\n- Aspergillosis can be a primary disease, but it is also a common secondary infection in patients who are immunosuppressed, have cystic fibrosis, or are recovering from another infection (e.g., tuberculosis).\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) results from a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus spp. It most commonly occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis and can cause dyspnea, bronchial obstruction, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis.\n- Aspergilloma (i.e., fungus ball) is usually an asymptomatic condition characterized by a growth of fungus in preexisting cavitary lung lesions (e.g., old tuberculosis cavities).\n- \n- Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a highly lethal infection that usually occurs in severely immunosuppressed patients (e.g., neutropenia, chemotherapy, HIV). Aspergillus grows in a saprophytic fashion, spreading by erosion rather than invasion. It tends to colonize damaged lung tissues and blood vessels, leading to infarction, hemorrhage, and dissemination.\n- Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult to diagnose early because cultures of sputum and bronchial lavage fluid are insensitive. Biopsy demonstrating septate hyphae that branch at acute angles is diagnostic.\n- ",

Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?This question requires the test-taker to evaluate the risks and benefits of a drug that has been chosen for a specific medical condition and to recognize adverse effects that might arise from that drug\u2019s mechanism of action.\nThe treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised patients such as this patient with AIDS relies on medications that target the viral polymerase. The drug in the question stem, valganciclovir, is a prodrug that is metabolized to ganciclovir, an acyclic guanosine analog. Once it has entered the cell, ganciclovir is initially converted to a monophosphate by viral thymidine kinase and then converted to the active triphosphate by cellular kinases. The triphosphate then selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase, leading to termination of viral DNA synthesis. Valganciclovir is well absorbed when given orally, achieving blood levels equivalent to those achieved when the drug is administered intravenously. Adverse effects of valganciclovir and other nucleoside analogs include myelosuppression, which increases the risk of infection. Valganciclovir can also cause diarrhea, fever, and headache. Other antiviral drugs used to treat CMV include cidofovir and foscarnet. Zidovudine is an antiretroviral drug that inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase. Because both zidovudine and valganciclovir are myelosuppressive, the risk of myelosuppression is increased when both are used simultaneously.\n- Amebiasis causes bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and anorexia. The diagnosis is made with the use of serology, microscopic stool examination for trophozoites, or an antigen detection assay.\n- A stool test for Shiga toxin would identify Shigella infection, a possible cause of bloody diarrhea. The patient\u2019s HIV infection increases his risk of a number of infections, but there are no other indications of Shigella infection in the question stem.\n- Although many viruses are known to cause acute gastroenteritis, viruses are not typically associated with chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts. Moreover, viruses generally do not cause bloody diarrhea.\n- The patient\u2019s HIV infection increases his risk of cryptosporidiosis and of Cryptococcus neoformans infection, both of which cause watery diarrhea. However, they do not cause bloody diarrhea, and their presence would be detected by testing",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

When stained with India ink, light microscopy of the patient\u2019s CSF reveals encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds. Assuming a single pathogenic organism is responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms, what diagnostic test results would also be expected in this patient? (Assuming the pathogen has not been identified as Cryptococcus neoformans.)\nThe organism responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms is C. neoformans. The diagnostic tests that are expected in this patient are a positive serum antigen test and a positive CSF culture.\nCryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungus that typically infects patients with immunosuppression. It causes cryptococcal meningitis that is similar to that caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In the CSF, C. neoformans resembles C. meningitidis, since it is a gram-negative, encapsulated, intracellular diplococcus. However, C. neoformans is a large fungus with a narrow-based budding yeast form.\nThe key to this question is that it describes a fungal infection that is caused by a single organism (monomicrobial). C. neoformans is a monomicrobial infection, whereas candida is a polymicrobial fungal infection. C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast, while candida is not encapsulated. Candida is typically detected in wet mounts using calcofluor white stain, while C. neoformans can be visualized using India ink. Both of these fungi may cause infections of the CNS.\nThe diagnostic tests for C. neoformans include positive CSF culture, positive serum antigen test, and positive India ink stain.",
