    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",

Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient? This question requires login in order to view the free explanation\nAnswer: A\nA\n- Empiric therapy with itraconazole and reduction in immunosuppression are appropriate\n- B\n- Lumbar puncture, CT head, and brain biopsy are appropriate for the evaluation of this patient's intracranial lesion. However, the most important and first step is to obtain a definitive diagnosis, and all of these studies are indicated in this scenario. It is important to note that a lumbar puncture is contraindicated in the setting of suspected increased intracranial pressure and should not be performed until an imaging study has excluded a mass lesion.\n- C\n- Itraconazole should be administered with food to increase absorption. Itraconazole should also be avoided in combination with rifampin because rifampin increases the metabolism of itraconazole.\n- D\n- There are no data to support this.\n- E\n- The risk for a reaction from the amphotericin B is far greater than the potential benefit in this scenario.\nExplanation:\nThis patient has an intracranial mass lesion with mass effect. A definitive diagnosis should be obtained, and it is most appropriately achieved with a brain biopsy. Itraconazole is an appropriate empiric antifungal therapy in this case. Although brain biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) lesions, imaging studies can be used to aid in the diagnosis. In general, toxoplasmosis presents as multiple lesions, predominantly involving the basal ganglia, and often has an associated moderate mass effect. CNS lymphoma and tuberculosis usually present with a single lesion, which has an associated moderate to severe mass effect. Cryptococcosis has a characteristic presentation with dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Brain abscess can present as a single or multiple lesions with an associated moderate to severe mass effect. While a lumbar puncture is indicated in the evaluation of any patient with a CNS mass lesion, it is contraindicated in the setting of suspected increased intracranial pressure. A CT scan of the head should be obtained to exclude a mass lesion before a lumbar puncture is performed. As this patient has mass effect, lumbar puncture is contraindicated.\n Answer: A",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases.

An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis? (AIIMS 05)\n**HIV Dementia**\n\nHIV dementia, also known as AIDS dementia complex (ADC), is a neurocognitive disorder caused by HIV infection. It is characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms. The exact pathophysiology is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to the direct effect of HIV on the brain, as well as the indirect effects of chronic inflammation and immune activation.\n\n**Clinical Presentation**\n\nThe clinical presentation of HIV dementia can vary, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   Cognitive impairment, including memory loss, difficulty with concentration, and confusion\n*   Motor symptoms, such as weakness, tremors, and gait disturbances\n*   Behavioral changes, including apathy, agitation, and depression\n*   Difficulty with speech and language\n*   Loss of coordination and balance\n\n**Imaging Findings**\n\nImaging studies, such as MRI, may show:\n\n*   Disseminated white matter lesions\n*   Atrophy of the brain\n*   No mass effect\n\n**Laboratory Findings**\n\nLaboratory findings may include:\n\n*   Low CD4+ count\n*   High HIV viral load\n*   Presence of Cryptococcal antigen or Toxoplasma gondii IgG (indicating opportunistic infections)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of HIV dementia is based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. It is essential to rule out other potential causes of dementia, such as opportunistic infections, cerebrovascular disease, and neurosyphilis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of HIV dementia involves antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control the HIV infection, as well as symptomatic treatment of cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms. In some cases, cognitive enhancers such as donepezil may be used to improve cognitive function.\n\n### Answer:\nHIV dementia",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
