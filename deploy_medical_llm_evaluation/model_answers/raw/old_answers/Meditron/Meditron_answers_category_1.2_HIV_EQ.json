    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "How is HIV diagnosed?If you have a new infection with HIV, you do not have any symptoms. Even when the infection gets worse and becomes AIDS, you might still not have any symptoms.\n\nThe best way to know if you are infected with HIV is to get tested. There are different types of tests used to diagnose HIV. All of these tests look for HIV or for the proteins the body makes in response to HIV. Most of the tests look at blood.\n\nIf you have any of the following symptoms, your doctor or nurse might suspect that you have AIDS. In that case, he or she will probably recommend that you have a test to check for HIV:\n- Swollen glands in your neck, armpits, or groin\n- Fever, weight loss, and tiredness that lasts for weeks\n- Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week\n- Sores in your mouth or throat, or genital sores\n- A blue or purple skin rash that does not go away\n- Pneumonia (see \"Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)\")\n\nIf you have these symptoms, you might also have other infections that are not related to HIV. These infections can also happen in people without HIV.\n\nIn the United States, it is recommended that all people ages 13 to 64 have a screening test for HIV at least once. If you are pregnant, or at risk for HIV (for example, if you are a man who has sex with men), your doctor or nurse will recommend that you get tested at least once a year.\n\nHIV tests do not always show positive right away. That's because your body can take a few weeks to start making the proteins the test is looking for. If you have symptoms of HIV and your HIV test is negative, your doctor or nurse will recommend that you be tested again in a few weeks.\n\nWhat other tests should I have?If your HIV test is positive, your doctor or nurse will probably recommend that you have another type of test. This test can check if the infection you have is really HIV. It also checks which type of HIV you have. This is called a \"confirmatory\" test.\n\nThe most commonly used confirmatory test is called the \"Western blot.\" This test can take up to 2 weeks to get results. There are also other confirmatory tests that can be done at the same time as the first test. These tests can give you a result within minutes to hours.\n\nIf you are infected with HIV, your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to see",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV? An analysis of electronic medical records\n\nWhat is already known about this topic? \u25ba In high-income settings, the prevalence of comorbidities among people living with HIV (PLWH) is known to be high. \u25ba Comorbidities have been shown to vary across sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, age, race and ethnicity, as well as by HIV-related factors, like CD4+ cell count and time since HIV diagnosis. \u25ba There has been limited research on how comorbidities vary by HIV treatment status (receiving versus not receiving HIV treatment) and by other factors such as insurance status and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. What are the new findings? \u25ba This paper highlights the high prevalence of comorbidities across sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among PLWH in a US metropolitan region. \u25ba Among those who were diagnosed and/or initiated HIV treatment in the past 12 months, rates of comorbidities were substantially lower than those with long-standing diagnoses or who were receiving HIV treatment. \u25ba The prevalence of comorbidities was also found to vary across neighbourhood socioeconomic status.\u25ba Among PLWH not on HIV treatment, the most common comorbidities were infectious and parasitic diseases, and viral hepatitis.What do the new findings imply? \u25ba Given the high rates of comorbidities in this population, PLWH, especially those recently diagnosed with or initiating HIV treatment, should be screened for comorbidities to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment.\u25ba Healthcare providers serving PLWH should be aware of the elevated risk of comorbidities among those who live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\u25ba The healthcare system should continue to work to connect all PLWH with HIV care and treatment in a timely manner in order to improve health outcomes.\nABSTRACT Background The growing prevalence of comorbidities among people living with HIV (PLWH) may pose substantial challenges to the healthcare system, especially in high-income settings where antiretroviral therapy (ART) is widely available. We aimed to characterise the prevalence of comorbidities among PLWH across sociodemographic and HIV-related characteristics, particularly among those not on ART. Methods We extracted deidentified electronic medical records (EMR) from PLWH receiving care within a large healthcare system located in the metropolitan Washington DC region from 2013 to 2016. We assessed sociodemographic and HIV-related characteristics and documented comorbidities in the EMR by 23 disease categories. We calculated the proportion of PLWH with \u22651 comorbidity, and the proportion with each com",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "How can HIV be prevented?.\nThe main ways to prevent HIV are:\n- Do not have sex or \"sexually active drugs\" with a person who has HIV or whose HIV status is unknown.\n- When you have sex, use condoms (male or female).\n- Do not share needles with people who inject drugs.\n- Get treated if you get exposed to HIV (for example, if a health care provider accidentally sticks himself or herself with a needle that has your blood on it).\n\nIn addition, a doctor can prescribe medicines for people at very high risk of getting HIV from sex or drugs. This is called \"pre-exposure prophylaxis.\" If you want to start pre-exposure prophylaxis, ask your doctor or nurse about it.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?\nPeople with HIV usually have no symptoms for a long time. But they can still pass the virus to others.\n\nSome people get symptoms similar to the \"flu\" (such as fever, chills, and muscle aches) within a few weeks of getting HIV. These symptoms are caused by the body's reaction to the HIV virus. This is sometimes called \"acute HIV infection.\" But not everyone gets these symptoms.\n\nIf a person does not take medicines to treat HIV, he or she can become sick. The virus will attack and destroy the body's infection-fighting cells (also called the \"immune system\"). When that happens, the person can get very serious infections and certain types of cancer.\n\nIs there a test for HIV?\nYes. There are several types of HIV tests. They include:\n- A blood test\n- A test on a sample of fluid from the inside of the cheek\n- An oral fluid test: This test involves spitting into a special container.\n- A rapid test: This test uses a sample of blood from a vein or a finger stick.\n\nA positive HIV test means that a person has HIV. A negative HIV test means that a person does not have HIV. People sometimes get a false-negative HIV test, which means that the test is negative even though the person actually does have HIV. This can happen if a person has just gotten HIV and the test is done too soon. After a person gets HIV, his or her body takes a few weeks to make HIV antibodies. Antibodies are substances the body makes when it is fighting an infection. Tests to check for HIV look for HIV antibodies in a sample of blood, fluid from inside the cheek, or saliva. The body takes a few weeks to make antibodies to HIV. If the test is done too soon, it might",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "answer": "How frequently ART must be taken? What is the frequency of taking the ART drugs? How often must I take my antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs? How do I take my antiretroviral drugs?\nWhen a person is sick or is ill due to a disease, it becomes very important to take medicine or pills in order to get rid of the disease. When a person is HIV infected and needs to be treated, it becomes very important for the person to take his/her antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs. The antiretroviral therapy drugs are the medicines or pills that are being taken by people living with HIV in order to get rid of HIV infection. The antiretroviral therapy drugs are the medicines that are being used by HIV infected people to treat HIV infection. It is a must for HIV infected people to take their ART drugs as it can help them to stay alive, be healthier and live a normal and quality life.\nHow important is it to take ART drugs?\nIt is very important to take ART drugs. It is a must for HIV infected people to take ART drugs if they want to stay alive, be healthier and live a normal and quality life. If a person who is infected with HIV wants to live a longer life, he/she must take ART drugs. Taking ART drugs on time is very important for a person to have a quality and normal life. If a person doesn't take ART drugs properly, the person will die or will die very quickly. A person who is infected with HIV will have a weak immune system. When the immune system of the person gets weak, the person becomes prone to different types of infections and diseases. So, it is very important for HIV infected people to take ART drugs in order to boost their immune system.\nWhy ART drugs must be taken? What will happen if the person does not take ART drugs?\nIf a person is infected with HIV and doesn't take ART drugs, the person will die or will die very quickly. When a person gets infected with HIV, the virus starts killing the immune cells of the person's body. If the immune system of the person gets weak, the person becomes prone to different types of infections and diseases. So, in order to boost the immune system, it becomes very important for HIV infected people to take ART drugs.

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV? The answer is simple, Antiretroviral Medication (ARV).\nToday, I will like to tell the story of Nneoma (not her real name), a 24-year-old pregnant woman. Her world was turned upside down when she was told that her husband is positive for HIV. She had to go for a HIV test and she was positive. She was devastated because of the associated stigma. She was told that the virus is not a death sentence, but can be controlled with ARVs.\nARVs are the medications used to treat HIV infection and prevent HIV transmission. Nneoma was encouraged to take her medications faithfully to reduce her viral load and prevent transmission to her unborn baby. She was taught how to protect her husband and her baby from contracting the virus and was told that after delivery, she can choose to have a female sterilisation or continue using a family planning method of her choice to prevent pregnancy.\nNneoma was relieved that the medications are free, she does not need to pay a dime. The medications are taken every day and the goal is to reduce the level of HIV in the body (known as viral load) to the point that it cannot be detected with standard tests. Once she is undetectable, she cannot transmit the virus to her husband, and the baby will be protected from contracting HIV.\nNneoma gave birth to a bouncing baby girl in October 2017, and the baby has been tested for HIV and she is HIV negative. Both Nneoma and her husband are alive, strong, healthy and happy. She is still taking her ARVs daily and continues to protect her husband.\nNneoma is one of the many success stories. Her story was made possible by the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) program.\nThe PMTCT program is aimed at reducing the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies by using ARVs. It also ensures that mothers and their families live long and healthy lives. HIV positive women and children are provided with lifesaving ARVs and the program provides an opportunity for families to be linked to care and to receive family planning information.\nToday, we celebrate and thank all the unsung heroes and heroines, the health care workers, the volunteers, who toil day and night to ensure that mothers and children live long and healthy lives. In Nigeria, the work of these heroes and heroines is supported by the United States through the United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the United States Agency for International Development (",

Why is HIV particularly difficult to treat?\nWhat are the main cell types infected with HIV?\nIn general, how do viruses gain entry into cells?\nWhy is HIV particularly difficult to treat?\n## Answers:\n### Main cell types infected with HIV:\nCD4+ cells and macrophages (HIV is a lentivirus)\n### Mechanism of viral entry:\nIn general, viruses gain entry into cells by first binding to receptors (cellular molecules) on the surface of the cell. This process of binding can be compared to a lock and key, where the virus (key) enters the cell by binding to the appropriate receptors (lock). For instance, in the case of HIV, its gp120 (a glycoprotein on its envelope) first binds to the CD4 receptor of the CD4+ cell. Thereafter, gp120 undergoes conformational changes that allow it to bind to co-receptors (chemokine receptor 5 and chemokine receptor 4, in macrophages and T cells, respectively) on the cell surface. These events then trigger the fusion of the viral envelope to the cell membrane and the delivery of the viral genetic material (HIV has a single-stranded RNA genome) into the cell. HIV is then able to replicate and eventually destroy CD4+ cells.\n### Difficulty in treating HIV:\nThe treatment of HIV is particularly difficult because of two main reasons: 1) the presence of a large pool of latent virus in reservoirs (e.g. resting CD4+ memory cells) that are not affected by current antiretroviral drugs, and 2) the development of viral resistance to drugs.",

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?.\nWhat is the difference between HIV and AIDS?\nHIV is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that can cause AIDS or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. A person suffering from HIV can be referred to as HIV positive or HIV infected. The term \u2018AIDS\u2019 is used for people who have the late stages of HIV infection. HIV weakens your body's immune system, making you more susceptible to illness and infection. Without treatment, it can take a decade or longer for HIV to develop into AIDS.\nA person with HIV is diagnosed with AIDS when they are suffering from one or more AIDS-related conditions or have a CD4 count of less than 200.\nTo understand the difference between HIV and AIDS, we first need to know what CD4 count is. The CD4 count refers to the number of CD4 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. CD4 cells are also called T cells, and they are a type of white blood cells that play a vital role in helping the immune system fight infection. HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells.\nIf the CD4 count falls below 200, it indicates advanced HIV infection. When the CD4 count falls below 200, a person with HIV is at an increased risk of contracting serious illnesses, called opportunistic infections.\nIf left untreated, the HIV infection can progress to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). This is the most severe phase of HIV infection. People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems and are vulnerable to opportunistic infections (OIs).\nAIDS-related conditions:\nThe following are some of the AIDS-related conditions:\n- Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary\n- Candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, or lungs\n- Cervical cancer, invasive\n- Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary\n- Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal (lasting more than 1 month)\n- Cytomegalovirus disease (not retinitis), end-organ disease (not limited to skin or lymph nodes)\n- Cytomegalovirus retinitis (with loss of vision)\n- Encephalopathy attributed to HIV\n- Herpes simplex: chronic ulcers (for more than 1 month) or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis\n- Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary\n- Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal (lasting more than 1 month)\n- Kaposi",
