    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland? 1. Indinavir 2. Stavudine 3. Saquinavir 4. Zidovudine 5. Lamivudine\n**Understanding the question**\n- This question asks about antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS patients. - The year mentioned is 1990. - At that time, which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered? **Step-by-step reasoning process**\n- The drugs in question are indinavir, stavudine, saquinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. - We need to determine which of these were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland. - To do this, we can check the introduction of these drugs to the market: - Indinavir was approved in 1996. - Stavudine was approved in 1994. - Saquinavir was approved in 1995. - Zidovudine was approved in 1987. - Lamivudine was approved in 1995. - Since only zidovudine was approved before 1990, it is the only drug that could have been most frequently administered in 1990. - Therefore, the correct answer is 4. Zidovudine.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010? A comparison between two Swiss cohorts\n\nBackground: Data from North America and the United Kingdom suggest a high birth rate among women with HIV despite advances in antiretroviral therapy. Our aim was to determine the birth rate among women in Switzerland with and without HIV infection in 2010 and compare them. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of two Swiss HIV cohorts, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort Study (MoCHiV) to obtain the number of live births in 2010. These figures were compared with the numbers of live births in the general population as recorded in the national census. Results: There were 12 live births among 1609 women in the SHCS (0.75%) and 12 live births among 154 women in the MoCHiV (7.8%). The overall birth rate in the Swiss population in 2010 was 1.54%. Conclusions: The number of live births among HIV-infected women in Switzerland in 2010 was similar to that in the general population. This contrasts with results reported in other countries.\n\n# Background\nThe incidence of mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) has declined dramatically in the last 20 years [bib_ref] Impact of new antiretrovirals and treatment strategies on the HIV epidemic, Siedner [/bib_ref]. The number of women with HIV becoming pregnant in Switzerland is rising due to longer survival [bib_ref] Improved survival in HIV-infected persons: consequences and perspectives, Sabin [/bib_ref], access to treatment, and a shift in the demographics of the HIV-infected population. The latter is characterized by a large number of heterosexual women who have immigrated from Africa. In the last five years, the number of women who were enrolled in the Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort Study (MoCHiV) has increased. MoCHiV is a prospective study including all HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants in Switzerland. In 2010, 154 women were enrolled in this cohort. This compares with an average of 107 women between 2005 and 2009 [bib_ref] Outcome of pregnancy in HIV-infected women attending an inner city clinic in..., Thorne [/bib_ref].\nIn Switzerland, the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women ranges from 0.05% to 0.11% [bib_ref] Low prevalence of prenatal HIV testing in Switzerland, a country with a..., Bouchat [/bib_ref",

    "answer": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020? A cross-sectional study\n\nAim: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether or not there is a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in Switzerland during the years 2019 and 2020. Women who gave birth between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, were included in the study. The overall birth rate was calculated per 1,000 women with and without HIV aged 15 to 44. A linear regression model was used to examine the association between the birth rate and having HIV or not. The following variables were considered for inclusion: age, residence status, marital status, education level, place of birth, language, employment status, health insurance coverage, and nationality.Results: The overall birth rate in women with HIV (n=1,006,889) was 24.3 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. The overall birth rate in women without HIV (n=1,006,889) was 23.6 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. The crude odds ratio for women with HIV was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01-1.05; p-value=0.011).Conclusion: The overall birth rate in Switzerland was similar for women with HIV and women without HIV in 2020.\n\n# Introduction\nThe life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) has increased over the last decades [bib_ref] Life expectancy of persons receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in low-income countries: a..., Mills [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Long-term complications of HIV infection, Mocroft [/bib_ref].

This change in life expectancy and health status has also resulted in PLWH's increased interest in having children.

(B) What proportion of PWH who died from non-HIV related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20? (C) For PWH who died from non-HIV-related causes, what proportion had a first positive HIV test before the age of 20 at age-specific time points? A: For PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 1,163 (23.5%) had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20, including 103 (8.9%) who died from HIV-related causes before the age of 20. This increased to 27.4% when considering all deaths. B: For PWH who died from non-HIV-related causes, 3,044 (28.6%) had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20, including 1,028 (34.0%) who died from non-HIV-related causes before the age of 20. This increased to 35.1% when considering all deaths. C: The proportion of PWH with their first positive HIV test before the age of 20 for those who died from non-HIV-related causes before the age of 20 (34.0%) decreased over time. It also decreased for those who died from non-HIV-related causes after the age of 20 (24.3% for those who died between 20 and 30; 22.4% for those who died between 30 and 40; 12.7% for those who died between 40 and 50; and 6.9% for those who died over the age of 50).\n\n# Discussion\nIn this large study of deaths of PWH in England, the overall number of deaths and deaths related to HIV have declined, though less so in non-White groups. Over time, an increasing proportion of people died in older age categories. Deaths from HIV-related causes are a relatively small proportion of deaths among PWH, with a growing proportion from non-HIV-related causes. Those who died from HIV-related causes were more likely to be diagnosed later than those who died from non-HIV-related causes and had a first positive HIV test before the age of 20 at a slightly lower rate (27.4% of deaths from all causes).
