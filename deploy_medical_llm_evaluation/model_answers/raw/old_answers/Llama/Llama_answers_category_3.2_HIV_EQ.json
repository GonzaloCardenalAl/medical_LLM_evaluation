    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "A. Oxidation of the Vitamin C\nB. Reduction of the Vitamin C\nC. Hydrolysis of the Vitamin C\nD. Decarboxylation of the Vitamin C\nE. Deamination of the Vitamin C\nAnswer: A",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "A. Switch to another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\nB. Switch to another non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\nC. Switch to a protease inhibitor\nD. Switch to an integrase inhibitor\nE. No change in medication is required\nAnswer: A",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "answer": "",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."
