    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "1. IV dexamethasone\n2. IV vancomycin\n3. IV acyclovir\n4. IV ceftriaxone\n5. IV mannitol\n\nThe correct answer is: 1. IV dexamethasone\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation and lumbar puncture findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The initiation of IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate for treating this condition. In addition, IV dexamethasone may be warranted to manage increased intracranial pressure, which is a complication of cryptococcal meningitis. Dexamethasone can help reduce cerebral edema and alleviate symptoms related to increased pressure, such as severe headache.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to managing cryptococcal meningitis or its complications in this patient:\n\n- IV vancomycin is an antibiotic for bacterial infections, not fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.\n- IV acyclovir is an antiviral medication, primarily used for herpes simplex virus infections, not fungal infections.\n- IV ceftriaxone is another antibiotic for bacterial infections, not relevant to this case.\n- IV mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce intracranial pressure in certain situations, but dexamethasone is more specifically indicated for managing increased pressure in cryptococcal meningitis. However, mannitol might be considered if there are signs of impending herniation or severe cerebral edema unresponsive to dexamethasone.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "250 patients with confirmed AIDS, 240 positive screening examination, 250 control patients, 5 positive screening examination\n\nTo calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to determine the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) from the given data.\n\nTrue Negatives (TN): These are patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. Since 250 control patients do not have AIDS and 5 of them tested positive, that means 250 - 5 = 245 patients are true negatives.\n\nFalse Negatives (FN): These are patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. Out of 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, 240 tested positive, so 250 - 240 = 10 patients are false negatives.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV \u2248 0.961 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 96.1%, indicating that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96.1% probability that they do not have AIDS based on this test. However, it's essential to consider other test performance metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity, as well as potential confounding factors and limitations of the study, when interpreting these results.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min.

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Toxoplasmosis\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Central nervous system lymphoma\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nExplanation:\n- The patient's symptoms of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, falls, forgetfulness, disorientation, and difficulties with daily tasks suggest a neurological disorder affecting white matter.\n- The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are consistent with PML.\n- The patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) indicate severe immunosuppression, which increases the risk for opportunistic infections like PML.\n- The absence of mass effect and negative cryptococcal antigen make Cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n- Toxoplasmosis typically presents with enhancing lesions and mass effect, which are not seen in this case.\n- HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) does not typically present with focal neurological deficits like right leg weakness.\n- Central nervous system lymphoma would likely show enhancing lesions on MRI, which are not present here.\n\nGiven the patient's severe immunosuppression and MRI findings, PML is the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "1. Repeat HIV testing\n2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test\n3. Hepatitis C antibody test\n4. Rubella IgG antibody test\n5. Varicella IgG antibody test\n6. Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n7. Blood type and Rh status\n8. Urinalysis\n9. Glucose screening test\n10. Group B streptococcal (GBS) culture\n\nAnswer: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nExplanation: \n- Repeating HIV testing (1) is not necessary given her recent negative test 4 years ago and no risk factors since then.\n- Hepatitis B surface antigen (2) is essential for prenatal care, as it identifies current infection and guides prevention strategies for the baby.\n- Hepatitis C antibody test (3) is recommended for all pregnant women, as per CDC guidelines, due to potential vertical transmission risks.\n- Rubella IgG antibody test (4) is not required at this visit, as her immunity status was likely assessed during preconception care or previous health evaluations.\n- Varicella IgG antibody test (5) is important to determine her immunity to chickenpox, which can have severe consequences in pregnancy if contracted.\n- Complete Blood Count (6) is a standard prenatal test to assess for anemia and other hematologic conditions.\n- Blood type and Rh status (7) are crucial for managing potential complications related to blood incompatibility between mother and fetus.\n- Urinalysis (8) screens for asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infections, which can lead to complications in pregnancy.\n- Glucose screening test (9) is not typically performed at 8 weeks but may be considered later in pregnancy (24-28 weeks) to screen for gestational diabetes.\n- Group B streptococcal (GBS) culture (10) is usually performed later in pregnancy (35-37 weeks) to guide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\nIn summary, tests 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are appropriate for this prenatal visit. HIV retesting, Rubella IgG, glucose screening, and GBS culture are not necessary at this stage.",

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis\n2. Toxoplasma gondii prophylaxis\n3. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis\n4. Fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), which indicates severe immunosuppression, the appropriate additional medications for prophylaxis are:\n\n1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis: Yes, this is necessary due to the high risk of PJP in patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3, and especially in this case, where it's significantly lower. The standard prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\n2. Toxoplasma gondii prophylaxis: Yes, this is also recommended for patients with CD4+ counts below 100 cells/mm3, as they are at increased risk for toxoplasmosis. TMP-SMX, used for PJP prophylaxis, also provides protection against Toxoplasma gondii.\n\n3. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis: Yes, this is indicated for patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm3, which applies to this patient. Azithromycin is commonly used for MAC prophylaxis.\n\n4. Fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis: No, routine prophylaxis for Candida is not recommended in HIV patients, even with low CD4+ counts. However, if the patient has a history of invasive candidiasis or recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, fluconazole may be considered.\n\nIn addition to these prophylactic measures, it's crucial to address the patient's depression, which has led to non-adherence to his HIV medications. Referral to mental health services and support for medication adherence should be prioritized.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "1. Vancomycin\n2. Ceftriaxone\n3. Doxycycline\n4. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\n5. Erythromycin\n\nAnswer: 1. Vancomycin\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation, including fever, skin lesions, and low CD4+ count, suggests an opportunistic infection. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain are consistent with Bacillary Angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. Vancomycin is the antibiotic of choice for treating Bacillary Angiomatosis in HIV patients. The other options are not specifically indicated for this infection. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking, alcohol use, and intravenous drug use may complicate her overall management, but do not directly influence the choice of antibiotic for this specific infection.",

An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "1. Lipodystrophy\n2. Hyperglycemia\n3. Nephrotoxicity\n4. Hepatotoxicity\n5. Anemia\n\nAnswer: 1. Lipodystrophy\n\nExplanation: The patient is being treated with a combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a protease inhibitor (PI). Indinavir, the PI, is known to cause lipodystrophy, which is characterized by changes in body fat distribution, such as increased abdominal fat, buffalo hump, and facial wasting. This side effect is more common with older PIs like indinavir, which is now less commonly used due to newer, better-tolerated options. The other options are potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy, but lipodystrophy is the most specific and likely adverse effect associated with indinavir.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy.

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\nAnswer: 3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV, inconsistent medication adherence, and recent improvement in adherence, along with neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy), and cognitive impairment (MMSE score 15/30), suggest a central nervous system opportunistic infection or malignancy. The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, along with positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, points toward primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is an AIDS-defining condition and commonly associated with EBV infection. The other options do not fit as well with the imaging and CSF findings: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder would not typically present with a focal brain lesion; toxoplasmosis might show multiple lesions, not a single large one; cryptococcal meningitis would likely present with more pronounced CSF abnormalities; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy would show multifocal white matter lesions, not a solitary enhancing mass.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "1. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n2. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 4 weeks\n3. Administer nevirapine to the infant for 6 weeks\n4. Administer lamivudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n5. No antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant\n\nAnswer: 1. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n\nExplanation: Given the mother's HIV status and her controlled viral load during pregnancy (678 copies/mL), the infant is at risk for vertical transmission (mother-to-child transmission). The standard of care for preventing HIV transmission in this scenario is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn. Zidovudine (ZDV) is the recommended drug for this purpose, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines suggest administering ZDV to the infant for 6 weeks. This regimen has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of vertical transmission. The other options are not supported by current guidelines or evidence.",
