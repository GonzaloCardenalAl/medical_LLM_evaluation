    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "1. IV vancomycin\n2. IV dexamethasone\n3. IV acyclovir\n4. IV ceftriaxone\n\nThe correct answer is 2. IV dexamethasone.\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation and lumbar puncture findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The initiation of IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate for treating cryptococcal meningitis. However, given the elevated opening pressure (285 mm H2O) and risk of increased intracranial pressure, IV dexamethasone is often added to reduce cerebral edema and prevent complications such as herniation. The other options (vancomycin, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone) are not indicated for cryptococcal meningitis treatment.\n\nRegarding the mention of Chloramphenicol in the question, it is not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis and may have been prescribed for a different condition or infection in the previous patient. Chloramphenicol is typically used for bacterial infections, not fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "240 / (240 + 5) is not the correct formula for NPV. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN), where TN is true negatives and FN is false negatives. In this study, TN = 250 - 5 = 245 (number of patients without AIDS who tested negative) and FN = 250 - 240 = 10 (number of patients with AIDS who tested negative). Therefore, NPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance that they do not have AIDS.  240 / (240 + 5) represents the positive predictive value (PPV) in this case, not NPV. PPV is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is true positives (240 patients with AIDS who tested positive) and FP is false positives (5 patients without AIDS who tested positive). So, PPV = 240 / (240 + 5) \u2248 0.98 or 98%. This means that if a patient tests positive on this novel screening examination, there is a 98% chance that they actually have AIDS.  240 / (240 + 5) does not represent NPV but rather PPV, as explained above. To calculate NPV, we use TN / (TN + FN). In this study, TN = 245 (patients without AIDS who tested negative) and FN = 10 (patients with AIDS who tested negative). Therefore, NPV = 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This indicates that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance that they do not have AIDS.  240 / (240 + 5) is not the correct formula for NPV. Instead, NPV is calculated as TN / (TN + FN). In this study, TN = 245 (patients without AIDS who tested negative) and FN = 10 (patients with AIDS who tested negative). Thus, NPV = 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance that they do not have AIDS. The given formula, 240 / (240 + 5), represents PPV, not NPV.  240 / (240 + 5) is incorrect for NPV. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN).

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "1. Initiate empiric treatment with itraconazole\n2. Order MRI of the brain and cervical spine\n3. Perform a lumbar puncture\n4. Administer IV dexamethasone\n5. Consult neurology for further evaluation\n\nAnswer: 2. Order MRI of the brain and cervical spine\n\nExplanation: Given the patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, and sudden onset of focal neurological symptoms (right hand weakness), the primary concern is for an opportunistic infection or malignancy affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Itraconazole, an antifungal, might be considered later if specific fungal infections like cryptococcal disease or toxoplasmosis are suspected based on imaging or other diagnostic findings, but it's not the next best step here.\n\nThe most appropriate immediate action is to order an MRI of the brain and cervical spine to evaluate for structural lesions, such as abscesses, tumors, or demyelination, which could explain the patient's symptoms. This imaging study will help guide further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.\n\nA lumbar puncture (option 3) might be considered later if the MRI does not reveal a structural lesion and meningitis or encephalitis are suspected, but it's not the next step in this scenario. IV dexamethasone (option 4) could be used for edema management if a mass lesion is identified, but it's not indicated at this point without imaging results. Consulting neurology (option 5) is a good idea, but it should be done concurrently with ordering the MRI, not as a replacement for it.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Central nervous system lymphoma\n4. Toxoplasmosis\n5. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The patient's symptoms include right leg weakness, unsteady gait, falls, forgetfulness, disorientation, and cognitive decline, which are consistent with a demyelinating brain disease.\n- The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are highly suggestive of PML.\n- The patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) indicate severe immunosuppression, which increases the risk for opportunistic infections like PML.\n- The absence of fever, normal white blood cell count, and negative cryptococcal antigen test make Cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n- Toxoplasmosis is also less likely given the absence of mass lesions on MRI and the patient's Toxoplasma IgG positivity, which could represent past exposure rather than active infection.\n- Central nervous system lymphoma is less likely due to the lack of mass lesions and enhancement on MRI.\n- HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) typically presents with more gradual cognitive decline and does not explain the focal neurological deficits (right leg weakness) or MRI findings.\n\nPML is a rare but severe opportunistic infection caused by JC virus, which primarily affects the white matter of the brain in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV/AIDS. The diagnosis is often confirmed by brain biopsy or detection of JC virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment typically involves antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve immune function and supportive care, as there is no specific antiviral treatment for PML.",

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "1. Repeat HIV testing\n2. Repeat Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing\n3. Serum TSH\n4. CMV serology\n5. PCR for HSV-2\n6. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)\n7. Hepatitis C antibody\n8. Rubella IgG\n9. Varicella IgG\n10. Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n\nAs a senior physician, my answer would be: At this prenatal visit, the following tests should be performed:\n\n1. Repeat HIV testing: This is recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of previous negative results, due to the potential for new exposure or infection since the last test.\n2. Repeat Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing: These sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can have significant implications for maternal and fetal health, and screening is recommended for all pregnant women, especially in the first trimester.\n3. Serum TSH: This is essential for assessing thyroid function, as undiagnosed or poorly controlled hypothyroidism can impact fetal development and maternal health.\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Screening for hepatitis B is recommended for all pregnant women, as vertical transmission can occur during delivery.\n5. Hepatitis C antibody: Testing for hepatitis C is recommended for pregnant women with risk factors or in areas with high prevalence, but it's not universally required. However, given the hospital's policy of comprehensive testing, it's reasonable to include this test.\n6. Rubella IgG: This test confirms immunity to rubella, which is crucial for preventing congenital rubella syndrome.\n7. Varicella IgG: Similar to rubella, this test confirms immunity to varicella (chickenpox), which can have severe consequences for the fetus if contracted during pregnancy.\n8. Complete Blood Count (CBC): This is a routine test to assess overall hematologic status and detect any potential anemia or other abnormalities.\n\nCMV serology and PCR for HSV-2 are not universally recommended for all pregnant women but may be considered based on specific risk factors or clinical indications. In this case, since there's no mention of such factors, these tests are not necessary at this visit. However, it's essential to discuss CMV and HSV-2 risks with the patient and provide education on prevention strategies.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "1. Fluconazole\n2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis\n3. Tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis\n4. Hepatitis B vaccination\n\nCorrect answer: 2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis\n\nExplanation: Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), which indicates severe immunosuppression, PJP prophylaxis is essential to prevent opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is typically prescribed for fungal infections like candidiasis, not specifically for PJP prophylaxis. TB prophylaxis may be considered if there's a history of latent TB or recent exposure, but it's not directly related to the patient's current CD4+ count. Hepatitis B vaccination is important for prevention but not directly linked to the patient's current immunosuppressed state or PJP risk.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient should resume his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to improve his CD4+ count and overall immune function. Alongside ART, PJP prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended due to his severely low CD4+ count, which puts him at high risk for PJP.",

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)\n2. Ceftriaxone\n3. Vancomycin\n4. Linezolid\n5. Isoniazid\n\nThe patient's presentation suggests disseminated infection with Bartonella henselae, also known as cat-scratch disease, which is opportunistic in HIV patients. However, given the biopsy findings showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria (consistent with bacilli), the more likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), caused by Bartonella quintana or B. henselsonae (in this case, likely B. henselae due to skin lesions).\n\nFor Bacillary Angiomatosis in an HIV patient, the treatment of choice is typically erythromycin or doxycycline. However, since your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years (likely for Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis), it's essential to note that these medications are not effective against Bartonella infections.\n\nAmong the options provided, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not the ideal choice for Bacillary Angiomatosis, but it might be considered as a secondary option due to its broad-spectrum coverage, although it's less effective against Bartonella compared to erythromycin or doxycycline. However, given the context of your hospital's practice, TMP-SMX might be the most readily available and practical choice, considering the patient's critical condition and the need for prompt treatment.\n\nCeftriaxone, Vancomycin, Linezolid, and Isoniazid are not indicated for Bacillary Angiomatosis.\n\nIn summary, while not the first-line choice, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy among the options provided, given the hospital's practice and the patient's urgent need for treatment. However, it's crucial to consult with an infectious disease specialist for optimal management, ideally using erythromycin or doxycycline if available. 1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)\n2. Ceftriaxone\n3. Vancomycin\n4. Linezolid\n5. Isoniazid\n\nAnswer: 1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)",

    "answer": "1. Lipodystrophy\n2. Hyperglycemia\n3. Hypercholesterolemia\n4. Pancreatitis\n5. Hepatotoxicity\n\nAnswer: 4. Pancreatitis\n\nExplanation: The patient is currently on indinavir, which is a protease inhibitor known to cause pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The other options, while possible side effects of antiretroviral therapy, are not specifically associated with indinavir. Lipodystrophy, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia are more commonly linked to other protease inhibitors like ritonavir or atazanavir, or to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like stavudine. Hepatotoxicity can occur with various antiretroviral medications, but it is not uniquely tied to indinavir. Given the recent prescription of indinavir and the known side effect profile, pancreatitis is the most relevant risk for this patient.",

    "answer": "1. Glioblastoma\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nBased on the patient's history, symptoms, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)\n\nExplanation:\n- The patient's history of HIV and inconsistent antireviral therapy adherence increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, such as PCNSL.\n- The neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy) and low Mini-Mental State Examination score suggest significant cognitive impairment and brain involvement.\n- The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum is consistent with PCNSL, which often presents as a single, large lesion in immunocompromised patients.\n- The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL, as EBV is commonly associated with this malignancy in HIV-positive individuals.\n- While toxoplasmosis can present similarly, the MRI appearance and EBV positivity make PCNSL more likely. Glioblastoma is less likely given the patient's immunocompromised status and the presence of EBV DNA. Cryptococcal meningitis would typically present with more pronounced CSF abnormalities and a different MRI appearance.",

Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "1. Administer zidovudine monotherapy for 6 weeks\n2. Administer zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine for 6 weeks\n3. Administer zidovudine and lamivudine for 6 weeks\n4. No antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant\n\nCorrect answer: 1. Administer zidovudine monotherapy for 6 weeks\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the mother has been on effective triple antireviral therapy (ART) with a low viral load (678 copies/mL) near delivery, indicating good viral suppression. Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend zidovudine monotherapy for 6 weeks as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for infants born to HIV-positive mothers with well-controlled viral loads. This regimen is simpler and has fewer potential side effects compared to combination therapy. Combination therapy (options 2 and 3) would be considered if the mother's viral load was not well-controlled or if there were other complicating factors, such as poor adherence to ART or resistance mutations. Option 4 is incorrect because, despite the mother's controlled viral load, some transmission risk remains, and prophylaxis is still necessary to prevent perinatal HIV transmission.",
