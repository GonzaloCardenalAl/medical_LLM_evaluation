    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through specific blood tests in a stepwise approach:\n\n1. Initial Screening:\n- 4th generation HIV antigen/antibody combination test (most common)\n- Or rapid HIV antibody tests (finger prick)\n\n2. Confirmatory Testing:\n- If screening is positive, a confirmatory test is done using HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation test\n- RNA testing may be used in specific cases (like suspected acute infection)\n\nDiagnosis requires both a positive screening test AND a positive confirmatory test.\n\nNote: The \"window period\" (time between infection and detectable antibodies) is typically 2-6 weeks with modern tests, but can be up to 3 months.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "There are 3 main stages of HIV infection:\n\n1. Acute HIV Infection (Stage 1)\n- Occurs 2-4 weeks after infection\n- Flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, rash, night sweats\n- High viral load and very infectious\n- Many people may not recognize these symptoms\n\n2. Clinical Latency (Stage 2)\n- Asymptomatic period\n- Can last several years\n- HIV is still active but reproduces at low levels\n- Without treatment, this stage can last 10-15 years\n- With proper treatment, can last indefinitely\n\n3. AIDS (Stage 3)\n- Most advanced stage\n- CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3\n- Immune system severely damaged\n- Opportunistic infections become common\n- Without treatment, survival typically 3 years or less\n\nEarly diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy can prevent progression to AIDS and allow people to live long, healthy lives.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several key methods:\n\n1. Safe sex practices:\n- Using condoms correctly and consistently\n- Limiting sexual partners\n- Getting regularly tested with partners\n\n2. PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis):\n- Daily medication for high-risk individuals\n- When taken as prescribed, reduces HIV risk by about 99%\n\n3. PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis):\n- Started within 72 hours after potential exposure\n- 28-day course of antiretroviral medication\n\n4. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission:\n- Antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy\n- Proper medical care during delivery\n- Avoiding breastfeeding when alternatives are available\n\n5. Safe injection practices:\n- Using clean needles and equipment\n- Never sharing needles\n- Using needle exchange programs if needed\n\n6. Healthcare safety:\n- Screening blood products\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n- Following universal precautions\n\nRegular HIV testing is also important for early detection and prevention of transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. Most modern HIV regimens are once-daily medications, though some older regimens might require twice-daily dosing. Consistent adherence is crucial because missing doses can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure. I recommend patients take their medication at the same time each day to establish a routine.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Prevention of perinatal HIV transmission involves several key interventions:\n\n1. Maternal Treatment:\n- Start or continue antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy\n- Aim for viral suppression (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) by delivery\n- Continue ART during labor and delivery\n\n2. During Labor/Delivery:\n- Intravenous zidovudine if viral load >1000 copies/mL\n- Consider cesarean delivery if viral load >1000 copies/mL at 36 weeks\n- Avoid invasive fetal monitoring\n\n3. Infant Care:\n- Provide antiretroviral prophylaxis to newborn for 4-6 weeks\n- Avoid breastfeeding in settings where safe alternatives are available\n- Monitor infant for HIV infection\n\n4. Pre-pregnancy:\n- Counsel about importance of viral suppression before conception\n- Screen and treat other STIs\n- Optimize maternal health\n\nWith proper implementation of these measures, the risk of perinatal transmission can be reduced to less than 1%.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection primarily involves viral reactivation from reservoir cells, particularly resting CD4+ T cells. This transition is triggered by various factors:\n\nKey factors that can activate latent HIV include:\n- Cell activation signals\n- Inflammatory cytokines\n- Epigenetic modifications\n- Stress responses\n- Co-infections\n\nDuring latency, HIV proviruses remain dormant in reservoir cells with minimal viral transcription. Upon activation, transcriptional barriers are removed, allowing viral production to resume.\n\nHowever, the exact molecular mechanisms controlling this switch are not fully understood, which is one reason why achieving HIV cure remains challenging. Current research focuses on understanding these pathways to develop better therapeutic strategies targeting the latent reservoir.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
