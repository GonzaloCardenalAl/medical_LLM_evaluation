    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through specific blood tests in a stepwise approach:\n\n1. Initial Screening:\n- 4th generation antibody/antigen test (most common)\n- Rapid tests (finger prick)\n\n2. Confirmatory Testing:\n- Western blot or\n- HIV RNA test\n\nA positive result requires confirmation with a second test to establish diagnosis. The window period (time between exposure and when tests can detect HIV) varies:\n- 4th gen tests: 2-6 weeks\n- Antibody-only tests: 3-12 weeks\n\nEarly testing is crucial for prompt treatment initiation. Regular testing is recommended for those at risk.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several key methods:\n\n1. Safe sex practices:\n- Using condoms correctly and consistently\n- Limiting sexual partners\n- Regular STI testing\n\n2. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):\n- Daily medication for high-risk individuals\n\n3. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):\n- Short-term antiretroviral treatment after potential exposure\n\n4. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission:\n- Antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy\n- Proper delivery and infant feeding practices\n\n5. Safe injection practices:\n- Using clean needles\n- Never sharing needles\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n\n6. Blood screening:\n- Testing donated blood\n- Using screened blood products\n\nThese methods, when used appropriately, are highly effective at preventing HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. Most modern ART regimens are once-daily dosing, though some older regimens may require twice-daily dosing. Adherence is crucial - missing doses can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure. I strongly recommend taking ART at the same time each day to establish a routine and ensure optimal drug levels in the body.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "The main cell types infected by HIV are:\n\n1. CD4+ T lymphocytes (helper T cells) - the primary target\n2. Macrophages\n3. Dendritic cells\n\nHIV specifically targets cells that express the CD4 receptor and either of the co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. CD4+ T cells are the most severely affected, leading to their progressive depletion which is the hallmark of HIV infection and AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."

    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). The key differences are:\n\nHIV is the virus itself, while AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. A person has AIDS when:\n\n1. Their CD4 T-cell count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 (normal is 500-1,600), and/or\n2. They develop one or more opportunistic infections or cancers that are AIDS-defining illnesses\n\nSomeone can have HIV for many years before developing AIDS, especially with proper antiretroviral therapy. With current treatments, many people with HIV never develop AIDS at all.\n\nIt's important to note that while all people with AIDS have HIV, not all people with HIV have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is NOT transmitted through:\n\n1. Casual contact like:\n- Hugging\n- Shaking hands\n- Sharing toilets\n- Using same utensils/dishes\n- Swimming pools\n\n2. Air or water\n\n3. Insects (including mosquito bites)\n\n4. Saliva, tears, or sweat\n\n5. Closed-mouth kissing\n\n6. Sharing food or drinks\n\nThese everyday interactions are completely safe because HIV cannot survive long outside the human body and requires direct contact with specific bodily fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, or breast milk) to transmit the infection.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection primarily involves the reactivation of dormant HIV proviruses in reservoir cells, mainly resting memory CD4+ T cells. This transition is triggered by various factors including:\n\n1. Cellular activation signals (like cytokines)\n2. Epigenetic modifications\n3. Transcription factor NF-\u03baB activation\n\nHowever, the exact molecular mechanisms controlling this switch aren't fully understood yet. We know that latency helps the virus evade both the immune system and antiretroviral therapy, making HIV eradication challenging. The unpredictable nature of viral reactivation from latency remains an active area of research in HIV cure strategies.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
