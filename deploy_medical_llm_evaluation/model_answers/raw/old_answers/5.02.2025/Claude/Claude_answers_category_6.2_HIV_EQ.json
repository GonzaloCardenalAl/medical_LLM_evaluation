    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "In this case of suspected cryptococcal meningitis (based on high opening pressure and empiric treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine), the patient requires:\n\nImmediate therapeutic serial lumbar punctures to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) if opening pressure is >250 mm H2O. This should be done to:\n- Reduce symptoms\n- Prevent visual loss\n- Reduce risk of death\n\nThe goal is to:\n1. Lower pressure to 50% of opening pressure or to normal (<200 mm H2O)\n2. Remove 20-30 mL of CSF per procedure\n3. Repeat daily until pressure normalizes and symptoms improve\n\nNote: I must point out that chloramphenicol would not be an appropriate treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, so that part of the question may reflect a misunderstanding.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "Let me help calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the data:\n- True Negatives = 245 (control patients who tested negative)\n- False Negatives = 10 (AIDS patients who tested negative)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245/255 = 0.961 or 96.1%\n\nNote: The value you mentioned (240/(240+5)) is actually the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), not the NPV.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain an urgent brain MRI with contrast. Here's why:\n\n1. The patient presents with focal neurological deficits (right hand weakness) and fever\n2. His CD4 count is very low (77/mm^3), putting him at high risk for opportunistic infections\n3. He has poor medication adherence\n4. The presentation suggests a possible space-occupying lesion, with toxoplasmosis being a leading consideration\n\nI notice the mention about empiric itraconazole treatment at your hospital, but this would not be the appropriate first step. Itraconazole is typically used for fungal infections, but the presentation here is more concerning for either toxoplasmosis or other CNS processes (lymphoma, other opportunistic infections).\n\nAfter obtaining the MRI, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis (typically with pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine and leucovorin) would likely be initiated if imaging is consistent with this diagnosis, as it's the most common CNS opportunistic infection in AIDS patients.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), not vascular dementia.\n\nKey supporting features:\n1. Severely immunocompromised patient (CD4 count 56/\u03bcL)\n2. High viral load due to medication non-compliance\n3. Progressive neurological symptoms (cognitive decline, gait problems, weakness)\n4. MRI showing white matter lesions without enhancement or mass effect\n5. Subacute onset of symptoms\n\nWhile vascular dementia can present with similar symptoms, the MRI findings and the patient's severe immunocompromised state strongly point to PML, which is caused by JC virus reactivation in severely immunocompromised HIV patients.\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Immediate reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy\n2. Close monitoring for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\n3. Supportive care",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's very low CD4 count (<100 cells/mm3), he needs prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The key medications would be:\n\n1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis\n\n2. Fluconazole for candidiasis prophylaxis\n\nIt's also essential to:\n- Restart his antiretroviral therapy\n- Address his depression with appropriate mental health referral/treatment\n- Implement adherence support strategies\n\nThese preventive medications can be discontinued once his CD4 count rises above 200 cells/mm3 with sustained viral suppression on ART.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation (fever, skin lesions), risk factors (IV drug use), severely low CD4 count (<100), and most importantly the biopsy showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, this patient likely has Bacillary Angiomatosis caused by Bartonella species.\n\nThe most appropriate treatment would be:\n- First-line: Erythromycin or Doxycycline for at least 3 months\n\nNote: While the question mentions Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine use in the hospital, these medications are typically used for toxoplasmosis and would not be appropriate for treating Bacillary Angiomatosis. The treatment needs to specifically target Bartonella with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nThe patient should also be:\n- Started on antiretroviral therapy after stabilization\n- Counseled regarding drug cessation\n- Evaluated for other opportunistic infections (noting oral thrush is present)",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "For the specific scenario presented, among the medications listed (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), the most significant potential adverse effects to monitor for are:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)-related:\n- Bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia)\n- Myopathy\n- Headache\n- GI intolerance\n\n2. Indinavir-related:\n- Kidney stones\n- Hyperbilirubinemia\n- GI symptoms\n\n3. Lamivudine (3TC):\n- Generally well tolerated\n- Possible headache, nausea, fatigue\n\nThe question mentions pancreatitis, but none of these medications are particularly associated with pancreatitis as a major side effect. Didanosine (ddI) and stavudine (d4T) are the antiretrovirals most commonly associated with pancreatitis, but these aren't mentioned in the regimen.\n\nThe most significant risks for this specific combination would be zidovudine-related bone marrow suppression and indinavir-related nephrolithiasis.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the presented case, the most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), not Glioblastoma. Here's why:\n\nKey supporting findings:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Ring-enhancing brain lesion\n3. Positive EBV DNA in CSF\n4. HIV-positive status with history of poor medication adherence\n5. Neurological symptoms including personality changes, headaches, and ataxia\n\nPCNSL in HIV patients is strongly associated with EBV infection and typically occurs when CD4 counts are very low (<100 cells/\u03bcL). The positive EBV PCR in CSF is particularly diagnostic in this setting.\n\nWhile Glioblastoma can present similarly on imaging, the combination of:\n- HIV-positive status\n- Very low CD4 count\n- EBV-positive CSF\n- Ring-enhancing lesion\n\nMakes PCNSL much more likely than Glioblastoma in this case.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the scenario, the most appropriate next step is to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis within 6-12 hours of birth. Since the mother's viral load was >50 copies/mL near delivery, this infant is at higher risk and should receive three-drug prophylaxis.\n\nThe recommended regimen would be:\n- Zidovudine (ZDV) + Lamivudine (3TC) for 4 weeks\n- Plus Nevirapine (NVP) for 2 weeks\n\nAdditionally, the infant should:\n- Have baseline HIV testing (HIV DNA/RNA PCR, not antibody testing)\n- Be monitored closely for medication side effects\n- Have follow-up HIV testing per protocol at 2 weeks, 4-6 weeks, and 4-6 months\n\nThe early initiation of prophylaxis is crucial to reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
