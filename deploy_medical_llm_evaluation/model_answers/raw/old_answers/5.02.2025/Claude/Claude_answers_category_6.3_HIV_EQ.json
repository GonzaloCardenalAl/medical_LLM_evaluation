    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and CSF findings suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, the most important additional acute treatment would be:\n\nManagement of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) through:\n- Therapeutic lumbar punctures to reduce opening pressure to < 200 mm H2O\n- May need to be performed daily initially if symptoms persist\n\nNote: The mention of Chloramphenicol in the question seems incorrect, as it's not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients. The current first-line treatment is indeed what was initiated (amphotericin B + flucytosine).\n\nSerial lumbar punctures are crucial in the acute setting to prevent potential complications from elevated ICP, including visual loss and death.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "Let me help calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nNPV is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly doesn't have the disease.\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nFrom the data:\n- True Negatives = 245 (control patients who tested negative)\n- False Negatives = 10 (AIDS patients who tested negative)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245/255 = 0.961 or 96.1%\n\nNote: The calculation you mentioned (240/(240+5)) is actually the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), not the NPV.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation, this patient likely has toxoplasmosis encephalitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm\u00b3. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are:\n- Low CD4 count (77 cells/mm\u00b3)\n- Focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness)\n- Fever\n- Poor medication adherence\n- Lack of TMP-SMX prophylaxis compliance\n\nThe next best step would be to:\n1. Obtain urgent brain imaging (CT with contrast or MRI) to confirm the diagnosis\n2. Start empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine and leucovorin\n\nNote: The mention of empiric itraconazole use at the hospital is not relevant here, as itraconazole is not the appropriate treatment for suspected toxoplasmosis encephalitis. The clinical presentation is more consistent with toxoplasmosis than other CNS infections in HIV patients (like cryptococcosis or CNS lymphoma).",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND), specifically HIV encephalopathy/AIDS dementia complex.\n\nKey supporting features:\n1. Progressive cognitive decline (memory issues, difficulty with familiar tasks)\n2. Motor symptoms (weakness, unsteady gait)\n3. Behavioral changes (paranoia, agitation)\n4. Advanced HIV disease (CD4 count 56/\u03bcL, high viral load)\n5. Medication non-compliance\n6. MRI showing white matter lesions without mass effect\n7. Young age for vascular dementia\n\nWhile vascular dementia may present similarly, this patient's age, HIV status, and presentation are much more consistent with HAND. The condition is a direct result of HIV infection of the central nervous system and is more common in patients with advanced disease and poor medication compliance, as seen in this case.\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Initiating/restarting antiretroviral therapy\n2. Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections\n3. Close monitoring of cognitive function",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For a first prenatal visit at 8 weeks' gestation, the recommended tests include:\n\nEssential tests:\n1. Complete blood count (CBC)\n2. Blood type and Rh status\n3. Antibody screen\n4. Urine culture and urinalysis\n5. RPR/VDRL for syphilis\n6. HIV testing\n7. Hepatitis B surface antigen\n8. Rubella immunity status\n\nOptional/risk-based screening:\n- Hepatitis C screening\n- Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing\n- Genetic carrier screening based on ethnicity/family history\n- TB screening if high-risk\n\nNote: While your hospital has been testing TSH, CMV, and HSV-2, these are not universally recommended as routine first trimester prenatal screening tests. TSH screening may be considered, but CMV and HSV-2 testing are typically only done if there are specific risk factors or symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the very low CD4 count (<100 cells/mm3), this patient needs prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The key medications would be:\n\n1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis\n\n2. Fluconazole for cryptococcal disease prophylaxis\n\nIt's also important to:\n- Restart antiretroviral therapy promptly\n- Screen for active opportunistic infections\n- Address the underlying depression, as this is affecting medication adherence\n\nOnce the CD4 count increases to >200 cells/mm3 for at least 3 months on stable ART, prophylaxis can be discontinued.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the presentation - fever, skin lesions (red papules), and the biopsy showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain in an immunocompromised patient (CD4 count 98) - this is most consistent with Bacillary Angiomatosis caused by Bartonella species.\n\nThe most appropriate treatment would be:\n- Erythromycin 500 mg orally 4 times daily\nOR\n- Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily\n\nTreatment should be continued for at least 3 months due to her severe immunosuppression.\n\nNote: The mention of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is not relevant here as those medications are typically used for toxoplasmosis, not Bacillary Angiomatosis.\n\nThe patient should also be evaluated for starting or optimizing antiretroviral therapy given her low CD4 count.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "For the antiretroviral regimen mentioned (lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir), the most significant adverse effects to monitor for would be:\n\n1. From Zidovudine (AZT):\n- Bone marrow suppression (particularly anemia)\n- Myopathy\n- Lactic acidosis\n\n2. From Indinavir:\n- Kidney stones\n- Hyperbilirubinemia\n- GI intolerance\n\n3. From Lamivudine (3TC):\n- Generally well tolerated but can cause headache and GI symptoms\n\nThe most concerning or likely adverse effects from this specific combination would be:\n- Kidney stones (from indinavir)\n- Anemia (from zidovudine)\n\nNote: While you mentioned pancreatitis in your question, none of these medications are particularly associated with pancreatitis as a common adverse effect. Didanosine (ddI) and stavudine (d4T) are the antiretrovirals most commonly associated with pancreatitis, but these aren't part of the regimen mentioned.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), not Glioblastoma. Here's why:\n\nKey findings supporting PCNSL:\n1. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/\u03bcL)\n2. Ring-enhancing brain lesion\n3. Positive EBV DNA in CSF (strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n4. Recent non-compliance with ART\n5. Subacute neurological symptoms\n\nWhile Glioblastoma can present similarly on imaging, the combination of:\n- HIV-positive status\n- Severely immunocompromised state\n- EBV-positive CSF\n- Ring-enhancing lesion\n\nMakes PCNSL much more likely in this context. PCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/\u03bcL and is strongly associated with EBV infection.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis would require brain biopsy, but the clinical presentation and findings strongly suggest PCNSL.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "For this newborn with significant perinatal HIV exposure and maternal viral load >50 copies/mL near delivery, the most appropriate next step is to initiate three-drug antiretroviral prophylaxis within 6-12 hours of birth.\n\nThe recommended regimen would include:\n- Zidovudine (ZDV)\n- Lamivudine (3TC)\n- Nevirapine (NVP)\n\nThis three-drug regimen should be continued for 6 weeks, with close monitoring for potential side effects. The infant should also have HIV testing performed according to guidelines:\n- HIV DNA/RNA testing at birth\n- Follow-up testing at 2-3 weeks, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age\n\nRegular clinical follow-up is essential to monitor medication tolerance, adherence, and development.\n\nThe relatively high maternal viral load (>50 copies/mL) near delivery justifies the three-drug prophylaxis approach over single-drug ZDV prophylaxis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
