    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "I need to point out that this question contains a flawed premise. In 1990, there were very limited antiretroviral treatment options available globally, including in Switzerland. AZT (zidovudine) was the only FDA-approved antiretroviral drug until 1991, when didanosine (ddI) was approved. Therefore, it would not be possible to list five frequently administered antiretroviral drugs from 1990, as they simply did not exist yet. The era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) began in the mid-1990s with the introduction of protease inhibitors.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot provide specific data about antiretroviral drug usage in Switzerland for 2010 with confidence. While there are databases tracking HIV medication use in Switzerland (like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study), I don't have access to accurate statistics about the most frequently prescribed antiretrovirals for that specific year. Making claims about such specific data without verification would be inappropriate.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot make a specific claim about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for 2010, as I don't have access to reliable statistics for this specific comparison and year. Making statements about such specific demographic data without proper sources would be inappropriate and potentially misleading.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot make a specific claim about birth rate differences between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for 2020, as I don't have access to reliable statistical data for this specific comparison and year. Making statements about such specific demographic information without verified data would not be appropriate.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

  {
    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In Switzerland, sexual transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM), is the most common route of HIV transmission. However, heterosexual transmission also accounts for a significant proportion of new HIV infections. It's worth noting that injection drug use, which was a major transmission route in the 1980s and early 1990s, has dramatically decreased due to successful harm reduction programs in Switzerland.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "Based on Swiss HIV Cohort Study data, approximately 20-30% of clinic visits involve patients who self-report missing at least one dose of their HIV medication per month. However, I should note that self-reported adherence data tends to underestimate actual non-adherence, as patients often over-report their medication compliance.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study's SHCS 2020 report, approximately 40% of People Living With HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland reported feeling guilty about their HIV status. However, I recommend double-checking this specific figure, as I'm not entirely certain about the exact percentage from that particular year.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."
  },
  {
    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Quality of Life Survey from 2020, approximately 28% of people living with HIV in Switzerland felt they were treated like outcasts. However, I recommend verifying this specific statistic from a primary source, as I am not completely certain about the exact figure from that particular year.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

  {
    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot provide specific statistics about HIV-related deaths in Switzerland with regard to age at first positive test, as I don't have access to reliable data for this specific metric. Making claims about such specific statistics without verified data would be inappropriate. For accurate information about HIV statistics in Switzerland, I'd recommend consulting the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH/BAG) or Swiss HIV Cohort Study data.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."
  },
  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot make a specific claim about HIV progression rates in Switzerland for this particular time period and age group comparison without access to reliable research data that specifically studied this question. CD4 decline rates can vary significantly between individuals and are influenced by multiple factors. Making a statement about age-specific differences in CD4 decline for this specific population and time period would require specific epidemiological data from Switzerland.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
