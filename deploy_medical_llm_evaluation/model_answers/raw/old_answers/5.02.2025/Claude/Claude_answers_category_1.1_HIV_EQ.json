    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through specific blood tests in a stepwise manner:\n\n1. Initial Screening:\n- 4th generation HIV test (most common) - detects both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen\n- Rapid tests (finger prick) - typically detect HIV antibodies only\n\n2. Confirmatory Testing:\n- If initial screening is positive, a confirmatory test is done using Western blot or immunofluorescence assay\n- The two-test approach helps eliminate false positives\n\nEarly infection (2-4 weeks after exposure) can be detected using:\n- HIV RNA viral load test\n- p24 antigen test\n\nIt's important to note that after potential exposure, there is a \"window period\" before tests become reliable:\n- 4th generation tests: 2-4 weeks\n- Antibody-only tests: 3-12 weeks\n\nRegular testing is recommended for those at risk, and all positive results should be confirmed with a second test.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several key methods:\n\n1. Safe sex practices:\n- Using condoms correctly and consistently\n- Limiting sexual partners\n- Regular STI testing\n\n2. PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis):\n- Daily medication for high-risk individuals\n- Highly effective when taken as prescribed\n\n3. PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis):\n- Started within 72 hours after potential exposure\n- 28-day course of antiretroviral medication\n\n4. Harm reduction for drug users:\n- Using clean needles\n- Never sharing injection equipment\n\n5. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission:\n- HIV testing during pregnancy\n- Antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy/delivery\n- Proper infant feeding guidelines\n\n6. Blood screening:\n- Testing donated blood\n- Using sterile medical equipment\n\nRegular HIV testing is also important for early detection and prevention of transmission to others.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily controlled by viral latency and reactivation mechanisms. In latency, HIV integrates into the host cell DNA and becomes transcriptionally silent, mainly in resting CD4+ T cells. The switch to active infection can be triggered by:\n\n1. T cell activation signals\n2. Epigenetic modifications\n3. Transcription factors like NF-\u03baB\n4. Environmental stressors\n5. Inflammatory cytokines\n\nHowever, the exact mechanisms controlling this switch aren't fully understood. This remains an active area of research, particularly important for developing strategies to target the latent reservoir and potentially cure HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
