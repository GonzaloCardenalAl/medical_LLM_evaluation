    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, antiretroviral therapy for HIV was still in its early stages. The first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine (AZT), was approved in 1987. By 1990, a few more drugs had become available. Based on historical treatment guidelines, the following five antiretroviral drugs were likely among the most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was not yet widely used, so another option is: \n5. Lamivudine was not approved until 1995, so a possible fifth option could be: Ribavirin (although not primarily used for HIV, it was sometimes used in combination with AZT) or alternatively, no fifth antiretroviral was commonly used.\n\nPlease note that the exact ranking may vary depending on the source and specific treatment guidelines used in Switzerland at that time. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that treatment regimens in 1990 were often monotherapy, and combination therapy as we know it today was not yet standard practice.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "I don't have access to specific data on antiretroviral drug usage in Switzerland for the year 2010. For accurate information, I recommend consulting the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health or relevant medical publications from that time period.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in 2010, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population. However, I couldn't find the exact numbers. Studies suggest that women with HIV may have lower fertility rates due to various factors, including health concerns, access to reproductive healthcare, and personal choices. If you need more specific information, I recommend checking the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or peer-reviewed articles from that time period for more detailed data.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in Switzerland, the birth rates among women with HIV have been increasing over the years due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved healthcare. However, I couldn't find the exact birth rate comparison between women with and without HIV in Switzerland for the year 2020.\n\nThe Swiss HIV Cohort Study and other sources may have this information, but I would need to check the latest publications or reports to provide an accurate answer. If you're looking for specific data, I recommend checking the latest research articles or reports from reputable sources such as the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.",
    "true_answer": " Yes, in 2020, there were 1.46 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.42 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "According to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland is men who have sex with men (MSM), accounting for approximately 60-70% of new HIV diagnoses. Heterosexual transmission and transmission through injecting drug use are less common. However, please note that epidemiological data can change over time, and I would recommend checking the latest reports for the most up-to-date information.",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "Interesting question. While I'd love to provide a direct answer, I must clarify that I'm not aware of any specific study or data that directly addresses this question for the Swiss population between 1990 and 2010.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general insights. The rate of CD4 decline can vary significantly among individuals with HIV, influenced by factors such as viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle, and underlying health conditions.\n\nResearch suggests that age at infection can impact the natural history of HIV. Some studies indicate that individuals infected with HIV at younger ages tend to have a slower disease progression compared to those infected at older ages. However, this is a general trend and may not apply to every individual.\n\nWithout specific data or studies focused on the Swiss population between 1990 and 2010, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. If you're looking for precise information, I recommend consulting the Swiss HIV Cohort Study or other relevant research databases for more detailed insights.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
