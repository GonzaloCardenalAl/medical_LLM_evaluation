    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and the use of acetazolamide or other measures to manage elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), given the high opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Additionally, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be optimized or initiated as soon as possible to improve the patient's immune status. However, the immediate priority is managing the elevated ICP and treating the cryptococcal infection.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nTrue negatives are the patients without AIDS who tested negative, which is 250 (control arm) - 5 (false positives) = 245.\n\nFalse negatives are the patients with AIDS who tested negative, which is 250 (AIDS arm) - 240 (true positives) = 10.\n\nThe NPV is calculated as: NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 or 96.1%.\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96.1% chance that they do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and other conditions like stroke. \n\nThe next best step in management would be to promptly perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for potential causes of the patient's weakness, such as a stroke, infection, or mass lesion. Additionally, given the patient's fever and history of pneumonia, blood cultures and possibly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis should be considered to evaluate for infection. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current HIV viral load and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), as improving adherence or adjusting the ART regimen may be necessary. \n\nImmediate consultation with a neurologist and potentially an infectious disease specialist would also be beneficial in guiding further management and diagnostic testing.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nThe key features supporting this diagnosis include:\n- The patient's low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, indicating advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression.\n- The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, which is consistent with PML.\n- The patient's neurological symptoms, such as right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and cognitive decline, which are also consistent with PML.\n- The absence of mass effect and the negative cryptococcal antigen make other opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n\nPML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus that affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to his HIV medication, it's essential to address both his mental health and HIV management. \n\nFor his depression, I would recommend referring him to a mental health professional and considering antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are commonly used in patients with HIV.\n\nTo prevent opportunistic infections, given his low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), I would also recommend prophylactic medications, such as:\n\n1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.\n2. Azithromycin or other macrolides for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis may be considered, but typically when CD4+ count is below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's crucial to reassess and adjust his antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen to achieve viral suppression, which will help improve his CD4+ count over time. Close monitoring and support to improve adherence to his ART and other prescribed medications are also essential.",
