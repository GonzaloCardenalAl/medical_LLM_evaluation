    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV diagnosis typically involves a combination of:\n\n1. **Risk assessment**: Evaluating the patient's risk factors and medical history.\n2. **Screening tests**: Rapid tests or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect HIV antibodies.\n3. **Confirmatory tests**: Western blot or nucleic acid tests (NAT) to confirm the diagnosis.\n4. **Viral load tests**: To measure the amount of HIV in the blood.\n\nA positive result is usually confirmed with a second test.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

  {
    "question": "How is HIV transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is primarily transmitted through:\n\n1. Unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with an infected person.\n2. Sharing needles or syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood.\n3. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding (without antiretroviral therapy).\n4. Blood transfusions from an infected donor (rare in countries with strict blood screening).\n\nThese are the main modes of transmission. Do you have any specific questions about these?",
    "true_answer": "HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It can also spread from a mother to her baby."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through:\n\n1. **Safe sex**: Using condoms consistently and correctly.\n2. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medication before exposure to HIV.\n3. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medication within 72 hours after potential exposure.\n4. **Harm reduction**: Avoiding sharing needles and other injecting equipment.\n5. **Voluntary medical male circumcision**: Reducing the risk of HIV acquisition in men.\n6. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: Suppressing the virus in people living with HIV, making them less infectious.\n\nThese methods can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) is typically taken once or twice daily, depending on the specific regimen. Adherence to the prescribed schedule is crucial to achieve viral suppression and prevent drug resistance.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch from latent HIV to active infection is not fully understood, but it's believed to involve the reactivation of latent viral reservoirs. This can be triggered by various factors, including:\n\n* Immune activation\n* Inflammation\n* Antigen presentation\n* Cellular stress\n\nWhen a latently infected cell is reactivated, the virus begins to replicate, leading to an increase in viral load. This process is complex and involves the interplay of multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
