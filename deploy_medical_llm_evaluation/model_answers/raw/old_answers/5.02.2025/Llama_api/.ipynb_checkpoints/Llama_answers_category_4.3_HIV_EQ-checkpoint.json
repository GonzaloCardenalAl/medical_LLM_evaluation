    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and lumbar puncture results, it's likely she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. \n\nIn addition to the initiated antifungal treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, the patient may also benefit from adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, specifically to reduce the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This can be achieved with acetazolamide or repeated lumbar punctures to relieve the pressure. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status, vision, and other neurological signs is essential. \n\nAdditionally, consideration should be given to starting or optimizing the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to improve her immune status.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True negatives = 250 (control arm) - 5 (false positives) = 245\n- False negatives = 250 (patients with AIDS) - 240 (true positives) = 10\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 (or 96.1%)\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that about 96.1% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and other conditions like stroke. The next best step in management would be to perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke, infection, or mass lesion. Additionally, given the patient's fever and history of pneumonia, blood cultures and a thorough infectious workup should be considered. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current HIV regimen adherence and viral load, as poor adherence could be contributing to his immunocompromised state. \n\nAn urgent MRI of the brain and further infectious disease workup would be the immediate steps, alongside stabilizing the patient and managing his fever and any other acute symptoms. Consulting with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist would also be beneficial in managing this complex case.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nThe key features that support this diagnosis include:\n- Severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, high HIV viral load)\n- Neurological symptoms such as right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and cognitive decline\n- Disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, which are characteristic of PML\n- The absence of mass effect and the negative cryptococcal antigen test make other opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n\nPML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus that affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, it's essential to address both issues. \n\nFor depression, I would recommend initiating antidepressant therapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n\nTo prevent opportunistic infections with a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, I would consider prescribing prophylactic medications, such as:\n\n1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.\n2. Azithromycin for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis may be considered if the CD4 count is below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nHowever, the primary focus should be on re-initiating and adhering to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to improve the patient's CD4+ count and overall health. Close monitoring and support from a multidisciplinary team, including mental health professionals, are crucial in this case.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Given the treatment regimen of lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to each of these medications. \n\n1. **Lamivudine and Zidovudine**: These are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Common adverse effects include bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, neutropenia), nausea, vomiting, and headache. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis are rare but serious side effects.\n\n2. **Indinavir**: This is a protease inhibitor. Common adverse effects include nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), hyperbilirubinemia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Indinavir is also associated with lipid abnormalities and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the combination of these drugs, particularly when including a protease inhibitor like indinavir, can lead to metabolic changes and increase the risk of lipodystrophy syndrome, which includes central fat accumulation, peripheral fat loss, and metabolic abnormalities.\n\nMonitoring for these potential side effects and adjusting the treatment regimen as necessary is crucial in managing the patient's HIV infection effectively while minimizing adverse effects.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."
