    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis suggest cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the mention of Chloramphenicol in the context of a similar patient is concerning, as it is not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Chloramphenicol is typically used for bacterial infections.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms, particularly if there is increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, considering the patient's severe immunocompromised state, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be optimized or initiated as soon as possible to improve immune function.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True positives (patients with AIDS who test positive) = 240\n- False positives (patients without AIDS who test positive) = 5\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nFalse negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative) = Total patients with AIDS - True positives\n= 250 - 240\n= 10\n\nTrue negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) = Total patients without AIDS - False positives\n= 250 - 5\n= 245\n\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\n= 245 / (245 + 10)\n= 245 / 255\n= 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.08%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, presentation with focal neurological deficits (weakness of one hand), and fever, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis or a focal brain infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis), is high. However, the use of empiric treatment with itraconazole without further diagnostic workup is not appropriate as it's more commonly used for treating histoplasmosis or other fungal infections.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to perform a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including:\n1. Imaging studies (e.g., MRI of the brain) to identify any focal lesions or abnormalities.\n2. Lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to check for signs of infection, such as cryptococcal antigen or toxoplasmosis.\n3. Review of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and consideration of switching or adjusting the regimen if the current regimen is not effective or if there are concerns about resistance.\n\nStarting empiric treatment with itraconazole without a clear diagnosis may not address the underlying cause and could potentially delay appropriate treatment. Therefore, a diagnostic workup should be prioritized over empiric antifungal treatment at this stage.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD). \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as progressive memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, along with the neurological examination findings and laboratory results (low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load), are consistent with HAD. The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on the MRI of the brain also supports this diagnosis.\n\nVascular dementia typically presents with a more stepwise decline in cognitive function, often associated with focal neurological deficits and evidence of cerebrovascular disease on imaging. The patient's presentation and imaging findings are not typical of vascular dementia.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At this visit, the following tests should be done:\n\n1. **Confirmatory pregnancy test**: Although not explicitly mentioned, it's assumed given the context.\n2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia and other hematologic conditions.\n3. **Blood type and Rh factor**: Important for obstetric management.\n4. **Serum TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone)**: As part of routine prenatal screening to check for thyroid dysfunction.\n5. **Rubella immunity**: To confirm immunity against German measles.\n6. **Varicella immunity**: To assess immunity against chickenpox.\n7. **HIV screening**: Despite a negative test 4 years ago, HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit.\n8. **Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae screening**: Given the time since the last negative test and the potential for new exposures, screening for these STIs is recommended.\n9. **Urine culture**: To check for asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n10. **Pap smear**: If due based on previous screening history.\n11. **CMV serology**: As per hospital protocol, though it's not universally recommended for all pregnant women.\n12. **PCR for HSV-2**: Also as per hospital protocol, though not standard for all pregnant women without symptoms or history.\n\nNote: The utility of routine CMV serology and HSV-2 PCR in asymptomatic pregnant women without a history of genital herpes is debated and not universally recommended. These tests are mentioned because they are part of the hospital's protocol, but their inclusion should be based on current guidelines and the patient's specific risk factors and history.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's CD4+ count is 33 cells/mm3, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed prophylactically for patients with CD4+ counts below 100 cells/mm3 to prevent fungal infections, specifically cryptococcosis and candidiasis, but particularly for a CD4+ count as low as 33, other prophylaxes may be necessary.\n\nIn addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), this patient should be considered for:\n\n1. **Fluconazole** for prevention of cryptococcal disease and candidiasis, as you mentioned.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** for prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), especially given his severely immunocompromised state.\n3. **Azithromycin or other prophylaxis** might be considered for prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection if his CD4+ count remains below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's also crucial to address his depression, as it has impacted his adherence to HIV treatment. Referral to a mental health professional and support to improve adherence to his ART regimen are essential.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and biopsy results showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, the diagnosis is likely Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA). BA is caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana, and it's common in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is azithromycin or doxycycline. However, since your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, it's likely that they have been using it to treat toxoplasmosis or other opportunistic infections, not BA.\n\nGiven the options, I would not recommend Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine as the first-line treatment for BA. Instead, I would suggest using azithromycin or doxycycline, which are the recommended treatments for BA. If these medications are not available, erythromycin is also an alternative.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for pancreatitis due to the use of lamivudine and zidovudine, but particularly, the use of certain antiretroviral medications like didanosine, stavudine, and zidovudine (part of the patient's regimen) are known to increase the risk of pancreatitis, as well as lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. However, lamivudine and zidovudine are also associated with these risks. \n\nAdditionally, indinavir, a protease inhibitor, is also associated with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) as an adverse effect. \n\nIt is essential to monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of these potential adverse effects.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is not Glioblastoma, but rather a opportunistic infection. The positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with the clinical and radiological findings, suggests Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) as a strong possibility. However, the ring-enhancing lesion pattern can also be seen in Toxoplasmosis, which is another common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. \n\nTo differentiate between these two conditions, further diagnostic testing such as biopsy, or a trial of empiric anti-toxoplasmosis therapy with follow-up imaging, may be necessary.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and viral load, the infant is at risk for HIV transmission. The most appropriate next step is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant. According to current guidelines, the recommended regimen for infants born to HIV-positive mothers is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, not a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. This is because the risk of nevirapine resistance is a concern, and lamivudine is not typically used for prophylaxis in this setting. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start the infant on zidovudine (AZT) as soon as possible, ideally within the first 6-12 hours of life.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
