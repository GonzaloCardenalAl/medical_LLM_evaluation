    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, low CD4 count, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). However, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid and the ring-enhancing lesion are also consistent with this diagnosis. PCNSL is a common opportunistic malignancy in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (T-20), also known as Fuzeon. However, a more commonly used medication in this class is not typically the first-line treatment.\n\nA more commonly prescribed medication that targets the gp41 subunit is not typically used as initial therapy, but one example is Enfuvirtide's class: HIV fusion inhibitors. But for most patients, the initial treatment usually consists of a combination of medications from other classes such as NRTIs, NNRTIs, or Integrase inhibitors.\n\nIt's worth noting that Enfuvirtide is usually reserved for treatment-experienced patients or those with resistance to other medications.",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the molecular process that could be impaired is denaturation of proteins and degradation of heat-labile nutrients, such as Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that can be inactivated or degraded when exposed to high temperatures, water, or oxygen, leading to a loss of its nutritional value. Specifically, the heat can cause the breakdown of the vitamin's molecular structure, making it unable to perform its biological functions.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's diagnosis of acute pancreatitis following the initiation of combination anti-retroviral treatment including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz, it's crucial to identify the potential culprit behind the pancreatitis. Didanosine is known to have a higher risk of causing pancreatitis compared to other antiretroviral medications.\n\nAfter the pancreatitis resolves with treatment, precautions in her medication will likely involve discontinuing didanosine to prevent recurrent pancreatitis. An alternative antiretroviral regimen that does not include didanosine will be necessary to manage her HIV infection effectively while minimizing the risk of further pancreatic complications.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, particularly with zidovudine, increases the risk of hematologic adverse effects, most notably neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased white blood cell counts. Monitoring of the patient's complete blood count will be essential to mitigate this risk.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient\u2019s concern?",
    "answer": "For a newborn, the most appropriate diagnostic test to detect HIV infection would be the HIV DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which can detect the virus's genetic material. This test is typically performed at 14-21 days of life, but it can be done as early as 48 hours after birth. \n\nThis test is preferred over antibody tests because maternal HIV antibodies can cross the placenta and be present in the baby's blood, making it difficult to determine if the baby is truly infected. The HIV DNA PCR test can directly detect the virus, providing a more accurate diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "This is a complex situation involving patient confidentiality and public health concerns. The most appropriate next step would be to counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his diagnosis to his wife, given the potential risk of HIV transmission. However, the physician cannot disclose the patient's diagnosis to his wife without his consent, due to confidentiality obligations.\n\nThe physician should encourage the patient to disclose his status to his wife and offer to facilitate this disclosure or provide resources for counseling and support. Additionally, the physician should review the local laws and regulations regarding HIV reporting and disclosure, as these may vary.\n\nIt's also important to note that the physician's duty to protect the patient's confidentiality must be balanced against the duty to protect the wife from potential harm. In many jurisdictions, physicians are required to report HIV cases to public health authorities, who can then take steps to notify partners while maintaining patient confidentiality. The physician should consult with their local health department or a medical ethics expert to determine the best course of action.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or active infection are an area of ongoing research. Studies have shown that HIV-1 infection can alter the host cell's DNA methylation landscape, which may contribute to viral latency and pathogenesis.\n\nIn latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation of the viral genome, particularly at the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), is thought to play a role in suppressing viral transcription. Host cell DNA methylation patterns, such as those involved in immune response and cellular differentiation, are also altered in latent infection.\n\nIn active HIV-1 infection, global DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation of specific gene promoters have been observed. These changes can affect immune cell function, inflammation, and disease progression.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between DNA methylation, HIV-1 infection, and disease outcomes. The field is rapidly evolving, and new findings are continually shedding light on these interactions.",
    "true_answer": "I searched for your question and found some relevant results. According to these results, **DNA methylation** is a possible mechanism that regulates the **latency** and **reactivation** of **HIV-1 provirus** in infected cells  . However, the **methylation profiles** of HIV-1 proviral DNA may vary depending on the **disease progression**, **antiretroviral therapy**, and **cell type** of the patients ."
