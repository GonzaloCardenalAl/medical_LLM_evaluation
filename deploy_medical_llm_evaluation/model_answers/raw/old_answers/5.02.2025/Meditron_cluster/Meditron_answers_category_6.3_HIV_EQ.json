    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. Amphotericin B and flucytosine are appropriate initial treatments for cryptococcal meningitis. However, given the patient's severe headache and elevated opening pressure, it is likely that she has increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to the infection. In this case, additional treatment with acetazolamide or mannitol may be warranted to help reduce ICP and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, frequent lumbar punctures may be necessary to remove excess cerebrospinal fluid and further reduce ICP.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of the novel test, we need to determine the number of patients who tested negative and do not have AIDS. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of patients who tested negative in the control arm: 250 (total control patients) - 5 (patients who tested positive) = 245 patients who tested negative. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of patients who tested negative in the AIDS arm: 250 (total AIDS patients) - 240 (patients who tested positive) = 10 patients who tested negative. \n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives). \n\nTrue Negatives = 245 (patients who tested negative in the control arm). \n\nFalse Negatives = 10 (patients who tested negative in the AIDS arm). \n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 = 0.96 or 96%. \n\nTherefore, the NPV of this novel test is 96%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, fever, and focal neurological deficit, the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The next best step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities, including white blood cell count, protein, glucose, and culture. Additionally, imaging studies such as a CT or MRI scan of the brain should be performed to evaluate for any mass lesions or other abnormalities. Empiric treatment with itraconazole is not appropriate in this case as the patient's symptoms and presentation do not suggest a fungal infection.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia. The patient's symptoms of cognitive decline, memory loss, and difficulty with daily activities, along with his history of HIV and noncompliance with medications, are consistent with HAND. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions also support this diagnosis. Vascular dementia is less likely given the absence of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and the MRI findings.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For this patient, routine prenatal screening tests should be performed, including blood type and Rh factor, complete blood count, urine analysis, hepatitis B surface antigen, rubella antibody, and syphilis screening. Additionally, a urine culture should be performed to rule out asymptomatic bacteriuria. Since she is at 8 weeks' gestation, a dating ultrasound should also be performed to confirm gestational age and fetal viability. Given that she has no personal or family history of serious illness, no history of recreational drug use, and no history of sexually transmitted infections, additional testing such as HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae may not be necessary at this time. However, it is always important to discuss the patient's risk factors and offer testing if appropriate.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count and history of non-adherence to HIV medications, it is likely that he is at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis. In addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy, the patient should be started on prophylactic medications such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for PCP and sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine for Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis. Fluconazole is typically used for the treatment of fungal infections such as candidiasis, and may not be necessary in this case.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, neurological symptoms, and imaging findings of a ring-enhancing lesion, the most likely diagnosis is AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis as PCNSL is often associated with EBV infection. Glioblastoma is less likely given the patient's history and the specific imaging and laboratory findings.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to administer zidovudine to the infant for 4-6 weeks, as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. This is because the mother's HIV viral load was not fully suppressed at the time of delivery, increasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The infant should also be closely monitored for signs of HIV infection and undergo HIV testing at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
