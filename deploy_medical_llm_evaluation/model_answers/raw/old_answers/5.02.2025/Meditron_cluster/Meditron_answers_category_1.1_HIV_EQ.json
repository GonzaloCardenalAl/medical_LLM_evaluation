    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies to the virus. The test is usually done after a person has had a risk exposure to the virus, such as unprotected sex or sharing needles. If the test is positive, it is confirmed with a second test to rule out any false positives.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "As a senior physician specializing in HIV, I can tell you that people living with HIV are at a higher risk for various comorbidities due to the chronic nature of the disease and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some common comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, metabolic disorders, mental health conditions, and cancers. These comorbidities can be caused by the virus itself, ART, or other factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and poor diet. It is essential for people living with HIV to receive regular medical care and screenings to manage these comorbidities and prevent complications.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through the use of condoms during sexual intercourse, avoiding sharing needles or other drug equipment, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those at high risk, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for those who have been exposed to HIV. Additionally, early diagnosis and treatment of HIV can help prevent transmission to others.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) should be taken every day, exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Skipping doses or not taking medication as prescribed can lead to drug resistance and decreased effectiveness of the treatment.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV involves several measures, including:\n\n1. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women.\n\n2. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women with HIV to reduce viral load.\n\n3. Use of antiretroviral drugs during labor and delivery.\n\n4. Avoidance of breastfeeding.\n\n5. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers.\n\n6. Counseling and education of pregnant women and their partners about HIV prevention and transmission.\n\n7. Use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-negative partners of HIV-positive individuals to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.\n\n8. Use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in individuals who have been exposed to HIV to prevent infection.\n\nOverall, a comprehensive approach that includes early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention measures can significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "## Switching from Latent HIV to Active Infection\n\n### Factors Contributing to Switching:\n\n1. **CD4 Cell Count**:\n   - A low CD4 cell count increases the risk of switching from latent to active infection.\n\n2. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Adherence**:\n   - Poor adherence to ART can lead to the development of drug-resistant HIV strains and increase the risk of switching.\n\n3. **Immune System Suppression**:\n   - A weakened immune system, often caused by other health conditions or treatments, can contribute to the switch from latent to active infection.\n\n4. **Co-infections**:\n   - Presence of co-infections, such as tuberculosis or hepatitis, can increase the risk of switching from latent to active infection.\n\n### Summary:\n The switch from latent HIV to active infection is influenced by various factors, including CD4 cell count, ART adherence, immune system suppression, and co-infections.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
