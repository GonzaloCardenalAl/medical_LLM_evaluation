    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain or spinal cord and is more common in individuals with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid and the solitary, ring-enhancing lesion on MRI are consistent with this diagnosis. Treatment typically involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "answer": "The medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is Enfuvirtide (also known as T-20). It is a fusion inhibitor that prevents the virus from entering the host cell by blocking the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. However, it is typically reserved for patients who have failed other antiretroviral therapies due to its injectable route of administration and potential side effects. The first-line treatment for HIV typically includes a combination of medications that target different stages of the HIV replication cycle, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs).",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boiled the formula longer than needed, the heat could cause denaturation of the proteins in the formula, leading to a loss of their functional properties. This could impair the ability of the formula to provide essential nutrients and could also affect the palatability and texture of the formula. Additionally, the heat could cause the destruction of some of the vitamins and minerals present in the formula, including Vitamin C, which is sensitive to heat. This could lead to a deficiency of these essential nutrients in the child's diet.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Didanosine is a medication that is known to cause pancreatitis. Given that the patient has recently been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, it would be necessary to discontinue didanosine and replace it with another medication that is not associated with pancreatitis. The patient's healthcare provider would need to carefully monitor her for any signs or symptoms of pancreatitis while she is on this new medication regimen.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed by the physician scientist is the gp120 protein. This protein is a component of the HIV envelope and is the primary target of the humoral immune response in HIV-infected individuals. The gp120 protein is responsible for binding to CD4 receptors on T cells and is involved in viral entry into the host cell. Developing a more potent antibody against gp120 could potentially lead to a more effective treatment for HIV.",

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "This patient is at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, such as anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, due to the combination of zidovudine and valganciclovir. Both drugs can cause bone marrow suppression, which can lead to these hematologic abnormalities. The patient's current symptoms of pallor and dry mucous membranes suggest that he may already be experiencing some degree of anemia, which could be exacerbated by the addition of valganciclovir. Therefore, close monitoring of his blood counts is necessary during treatment with these medications.",

Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."
