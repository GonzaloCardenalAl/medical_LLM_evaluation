    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lab results are suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. The treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate. In addition to this, it may be warranted to consider the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent complications such as increased intracranial pressure or hearing loss. Chloramphenicol is not typically used in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "The NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of the novel AIDS screening examination can be calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = (Number of true negatives) / (Number of true negatives + Number of false negatives)\n\nIn this case, the number of true negatives is 245 (250 patients without AIDS who tested negative on the novel screening examination). The number of false negatives is 10 (5 patients without AIDS who tested positive on the novel screening examination).\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 = 0.96\n\nTherefore, the NPV of this novel test is 0.96, which means that 96% of patients who test negative on this screening examination are truly negative for AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the sudden onset of right-sided weakness, and the presence of fever, the patient should be evaluated for opportunistic infections, particularly central nervous system (CNS) infections such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis. A lumbar puncture should be performed to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of infection. Additionally, imaging studies such as a CT or MRI scan of the brain should be performed to rule out any structural abnormalities. Empiric treatment with itraconazole is not appropriate for this patient's presentation. Instead, the patient should be started on empiric therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, such as amphotericin B and flucytosine, while awaiting the results of the CSF analysis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's history of HIV, low CD4+ count, and high viral load suggest a diagnosis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The patient's cognitive symptoms, such as forgetfulness, difficulty operating appliances, and paranoia, are consistent with HAND. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are also consistent with HAND. While vascular dementia is a possibility, the patient's young age and lack of other risk factors for vascular dementia make it less likely.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "This patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and cryptococcal meningitis due to his low CD4+ count. Therefore, in addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy, he should be started on prophylactic therapy for PCP, which is typically trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Additionally, he should be screened for cryptococcal infection with a serum cryptococcal antigen test. If positive, he should be started on antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation is consistent with bacillary angiomatosis, a skin infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use, HIV infection, and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, she is at increased risk for this opportunistic infection. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain support this diagnosis. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is erythromycin or doxycycline. However, given the patient's history of sulfonamide allergy, doxycycline would be the preferred treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4 count, and positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, along with the MRI findings of a ring-enhancing lesion, are highly suggestive of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). This is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The patient's symptoms of headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy are also consistent with PCNSL. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a brain biopsy. Glioblastoma is less likely in this case given the patient's history and laboratory findings.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this infant would be to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis with zidovudine, which is recommended for all infants born to HIV-infected mothers, regardless of their viral load. The duration of zidovudine prophylaxis would depend on the infant's HIV status, which should be confirmed by HIV DNA PCR testing at 14-21 days of life. If the infant is HIV-positive, then combination antiretroviral therapy should be initiated. If the infant is HIV-negative, then zidovudine prophylaxis should be continued for 4-6 weeks.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
