    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV infection. The presence of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion on MRI and positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid are suggestive of PCNSL. The patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and neurological symptoms further support this diagnosis. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and antiretroviral therapy.",

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "## Inactivation of Vitamin C in Overheated Formula\n\n### Explanation\n\nVitamin C is a heat-sensitive nutrient that can be inactivated by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. When formula is boiled for an extended period, the heat can cause the breakdown of Vitamin C molecules, resulting in a loss of their nutritional value.\n\n### Molecular Process Impaired\n\n- **Denaturation of Vitamin C**: The heat from boiling can cause the protein structure of Vitamin C to unwind and lose its shape, rendering it inactive and unable to perform its biological functions.\n\n### Consequences\n\n- **Reduced Nutritional Value**: Inactivated Vitamin C in the formula may not provide the necessary benefits for the child's growth and development.\n- **Increased Risk of Deficiency**: Prolonged consumption of formula with inactivated Vitamin C may lead to a deficiency in this essential nutrient, potentially causing health issues.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "The patient is at risk of developing pancreatitis again due to the use of didanosine, which is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) known to cause pancreatitis. After pancreatitis resolves, the patient's medication regimen should be adjusted to avoid further episodes of pancreatitis. Didanosine should be discontinued and replaced with another NRTI that does not have a high risk of pancreatitis, such as tenofovir or abacavir. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of pancreatitis and other potential side effects of her medication.",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": " What would be the best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients?",
    "answer": "The best methodological approach to study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients would be to conduct a randomized controlled trial. This would involve randomly assigning HIV patients to either a treatment group receiving a microRNA-based therapy or a control group receiving a placebo. The efficacy and safety of the microRNA-based therapy could then be compared to the placebo group. This approach would provide the most rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients.",
    "true_answer": "To study microRNAs as therapeutic targets in HIV patients, the best methodological approach would likely include a combination of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials . Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters . The results of these clinical trials would be instrumental in determining the clinical feasibility of microRNA-based therapies for treating HIV infections ."
