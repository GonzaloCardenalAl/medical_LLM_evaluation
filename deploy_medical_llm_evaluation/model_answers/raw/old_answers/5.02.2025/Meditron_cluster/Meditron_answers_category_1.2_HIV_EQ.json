    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is diagnosed through a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies to HIV or the virus itself. The most common test is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects antibodies to HIV. If the ELISA test is positive, a confirmatory test called the Western blot is performed to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, a rapid test may be used which can provide results in as little as 20 minutes.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "The different stages of HIV are:\n\n1. Acute HIV infection: This is the initial stage of HIV infection, which occurs within 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus. During this stage, the virus replicates rapidly, and the individual may experience flu-like symptoms.\n\n2. Clinical latency: This is the second stage of HIV infection, which can last for years or even decades. During this stage, the virus continues to replicate, but the individual may not experience any symptoms.\n\n3. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome): This is the final stage of HIV infection, which occurs when the virus has severely weakened the immune system. During this stage, the individual may experience opportunistic infections and cancers that would not normally affect people with a healthy immune system.\n\nIt's important to note that with proper treatment, individuals with HIV can live long and healthy lives, and may never progress to the AIDS stage.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at a higher risk of developing various comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. They are also at a higher risk of developing certain cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Additionally, people with HIV may experience opportunistic infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "There are several ways to prevent HIV infection, including:\n\n1. Using condoms or dental dams consistently and correctly during sex.\n2. Taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication, which can reduce the risk of getting HIV if taken daily.\n3. Getting tested regularly for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\n4. Avoiding sharing needles or other drug injection equipment.\n5. Choosing not to engage in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex or sharing needles.\n6. Getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), which can reduce the risk of getting certain types of cancer that are more common in people with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is typically taken daily, with some regimens requiring multiple doses per day. It is important to take ART as prescribed by your healthcare provider to maintain viral suppression and prevent the development of drug resistance. Missing doses or not taking ART as prescribed can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "## Latent to Active HIV Switch\n\n### Understanding HIV Latency\n\nHIV latency occurs when the virus is present in the body but is not actively replicating. This can be due to various factors, including:\n\n1. **HIV-1 DNA Integration**: HIV-1 DNA integrates into the host cell genome, allowing the virus to remain dormant.\n2. **Latent Reservoirs**: HIV can persist in certain cell types, such as resting CD4+ T cells, making it difficult to eradicate.\n\n### Switch from Latency to Active Infection\n\nThe switch from latent to active infection is not fully understood, but research suggests that:\n\n1. **Reactivation of Latent Reservoirs**: HIV can reactivate from latent reservoirs, leading to active infection.\n2. **Immune System Suppression**: Weakening of the immune system can trigger the switch from latency to active infection.\n3. **Genetic Factors**: Certain genetic mutations may influence the switch from latency to active infection.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe switch from latent to active HIV infection is a complex process, and more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. However, it is clear that HIV can persist in a latent state and reactivate under certain conditions, leading to active infection.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
