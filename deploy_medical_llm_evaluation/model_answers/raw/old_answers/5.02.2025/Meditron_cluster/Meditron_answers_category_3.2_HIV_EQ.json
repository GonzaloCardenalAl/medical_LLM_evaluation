    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain or spinal cord, and it is more common in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection. The patient's symptoms, neurological examination findings, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are consistent with PCNSL. The MRI findings of a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum are also typical of PCNSL. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid further supports the diagnosis, as Epstein-Barr virus is associated with the development of PCNSL in HIV-infected patients.",

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "## Impact of Overheating Formula on Vitamin C\n\n### Importance of Vitamin C in Infant Nutrition\n\nVitamin C is an essential nutrient for infants, playing a crucial role in their growth and development. It is involved in various bodily functions, including:\n\n- **Collagen synthesis**: Vitamin C is necessary for the production of collagen, a protein that gives structure to connective tissue.\n- **Iron absorption**: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron from plant-based sources, which is vital for the production of red blood cells.\n\n### Effect of Overheating on Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C is a heat-sensitive vitamin, meaning it can be easily destroyed when exposed to high temperatures. If the formula is boiled for an extended period, the heat can cause the following molecular process to occur:\n\n- **Denaturation**: The heat can denature the protein structure of Vitamin C, making it inactive and unable to perform its essential functions.\n\n### Implications for Infant Health\n\nOverheating formula can lead to a loss of Vitamin C, potentially causing:\n\n- **Vitamin C deficiency**: A deficiency in Vitamin C can lead to scurvy, a condition characterized by fatigue, malaise, and poor wound healing.\n- **Impaired growth and development**: Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis and iron absorption, both of which are crucial for infant growth and development.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nTo ensure the formula remains safe and nutritious for the infant, it is recommended to:\n\n- **Follow manufacturer instructions**: Adhere to the recommended heating times and temperatures for the formula.\n- **Monitor temperature**: Use a thermometer to ensure the formula is heated to the correct temperature, but not overheated.\n- **Consult a healthcare professional**: If there are concerns about the safety or nutrition of the formula, consult with a healthcare professional for guidance.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."
