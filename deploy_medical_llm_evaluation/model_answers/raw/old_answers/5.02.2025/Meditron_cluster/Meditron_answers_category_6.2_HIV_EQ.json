    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation and lumbar puncture findings are suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. The initiation of IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate, as this is the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, the patient may also benefit from adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and intracranial pressure, which can improve outcomes in patients with severe cryptococcal meningitis. Therefore, additional treatment with corticosteroids may be warranted in this patient.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "The NPV of this novel test cannot be calculated based on the given data. The NPV is defined as the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who do not have the disease, which requires information about the number of true negatives and false negatives. The given data only provides information about the true positives and false positives.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient's sudden onset of weakness in one extremity, along with a history of HIV and fever, raises concern for a neurological infection such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis. However, the patient's CD4 count is low enough to also consider other opportunistic infections. The next step would be to perform a thorough neurological examination and obtain a lumbar puncture to evaluate for signs of meningitis or encephalitis. Additionally, imaging studies such as a CT or MRI of the brain should be considered to rule out other causes of focal neurological deficits. Empiric treatment with itraconazole may not be appropriate without further diagnostic testing, as this patient's symptoms may be due to a different pathogen.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, noncompliance with medications, low CD4+ count, and high viral load, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated dementia (also known as AIDS dementia complex). The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are consistent with this diagnosis. Vascular dementia is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of a history of stroke or vascular risk factors.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given his low CD4+ count, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections. In addition to his anti-retroviral therapy, the patient should be prescribed prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is typically trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). If the patient has a history of PCP or has a CD4+ count below 50 cells/mm3, he may also require prophylaxis for Toxoplasma gondii, which is typically sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain or spinal cord. PCNSL is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, slight pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA on PCR are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's recent inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy may have contributed to his immunosuppressed state and increased risk for developing PCNSL. A biopsy of the brain lesion would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
