    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV is typically diagnosed through a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies to the virus or the virus itself. There are different types of tests available, including rapid tests that can give results within minutes and more complex tests that can detect the virus earlier in the course of infection. A positive test result is usually confirmed with a second test to ensure accuracy.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "There are three stages of HIV: Acute HIV infection, Clinical latency, and AIDS. In the acute stage, the virus replicates rapidly and the immune system responds to the infection. The clinical latency stage is a period of time when the virus is not actively replicating, and the person may not experience any symptoms. In the AIDS stage, the immune system is severely weakened, and the person is at high risk of developing opportunistic infections and cancers.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "There are several ways to prevent HIV infection, including:\n\n1. Using condoms during sexual intercourse\n2. Avoiding sharing needles or other equipment for injecting drugs\n3. Getting tested for HIV regularly\n4. Taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication if you are at high risk of HIV infection\n5. Getting post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) medication if you have had a possible exposure to HIV\n6. Avoiding risky behaviors such as having multiple sexual partners, having unprotected sex, or using drugs\n7. Getting vaccinated against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can increase the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) is typically taken daily, and it is important to take it as prescribed by your doctor to maintain viral suppression and prevent drug resistance. Missing doses or taking medication irregularly can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant HIV. It is recommended to take ART at the same time every day, with or without food, depending on the specific medication regimen prescribed.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "## Preventing Perinatal Transmission of HIV\n\n### Overview\n\nPerinatal transmission of HIV occurs when an HIV-positive mother passes the virus to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. This transmission can be prevented through the following measures:\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n1. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for Pregnant Women**\n   - Administering ART to pregnant women with HIV can significantly reduce the risk of transmission to their babies.\n   - ART involves taking a combination of HIV medications to suppress the virus and prevent its transmission.\n\n2. **Elective Cesarean Delivery**\n   - For women with high viral loads, elective cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of HIV transmission during childbirth.\n   - This is typically recommended for women with a viral load above 1,000 copies/mL.\n\n3. **Avoiding Breastfeeding**\n   - HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, so HIV-positive mothers are advised to avoid breastfeeding.\n   - Instead, they should use formula or donor breast milk to feed their babies.\n\n### Summary\n\nBy implementing these prevention strategies, the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV can be significantly reduced, ensuring the health and well-being of both mother and child.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "## Switch from Latent to Active HIV Infection\n\nThe switch from latent HIV infection to active infection is not fully understood and is still an area of ongoing research. There are several theories, but no definitive answer has been established. Some possible factors that may contribute to the switch include:\n\n*   **Genetic predisposition**: Certain genetic factors may make some individuals more susceptible to active infection.\n*   **Immune system changes**: Changes in the immune system, such as a decline in CD4+ T-cell count, may trigger the switch.\n*   **Viral mutations**: Mutations in the HIV virus may allow it to evade the immune system and become active.\n*   **Environmental factors**: Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as stress or certain infections, may also play a role.\n\nMore research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the switch from latent to active HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
