    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with a CD4 count below 100. The patient is already being treated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which is appropriate. However, given the high opening pressure on lumbar puncture, the patient may benefit from serial lumbar punctures to relieve intracranial pressure and prevent complications such as blindness or herniation. The patient should also be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve her immune status, but this should be done in consultation with an HIV specialist to ensure appropriate timing and regimen selection.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the negative predictive value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to know the number of true negatives and false negatives.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the true positives and false positives:\n\nTrue positives = Number of AIDS patients with positive screening examination = 240\nFalse positives = Number of non-AIDS patients with positive screening examination = 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the true negatives and false negatives:\n\nTrue negatives = Number of non-AIDS patients with negative screening examination = 250 - 5 = 245\nFalse negatives = Number of AIDS patients with negative screening examination = 250 - 240 = 10\n\nThe NPV is calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV = 245 / 255\nNPV = 0.96\n\nTherefore, the NPV of the novel test is 0.96, which means that if the test is negative, there is a 96% probability that the patient does not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient's sudden onset of weakness in the right hand, along with his history of HIV and recent hospitalization for pneumonia, raises concern for a neurological complication such as a stroke or a CNS infection. The next best step in management would be to perform a thorough neurological evaluation, including a CT scan of the brain to rule out any acute neurological events. Additionally, a lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for any CNS infections. The patient's fever and recent hospitalization also raise concern for sepsis, so blood cultures and other appropriate labs should be obtained. The patient's HIV treatment regimen should be reviewed to ensure adherence and viral suppression, as well as to rule out any drug interactions or toxicities.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "This patient's presentation of cognitive decline, motor deficits, and MRI findings of disseminated white matter lesions, along with a low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, is consistent with HIV-associated dementia, also known as AIDS dementia complex. This is a common complication of advanced HIV infection and can present with a range of neurological symptoms including cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and behavioral changes. The absence of cryptococcal antigen and the presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG suggest that opportunistic infections are unlikely to be the cause of his symptoms. Treatment for HIV-associated dementia involves antiretroviral therapy to control the HIV infection, as well as supportive care to manage symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the brain, spinal cord, or eyes. PCNSL is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. The presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, slight pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA on PCR are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy and subsequent immune reconstitution may have contributed to the development of PCNSL.",
