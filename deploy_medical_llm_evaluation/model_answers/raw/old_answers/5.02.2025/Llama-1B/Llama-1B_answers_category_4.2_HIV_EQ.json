    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and lab results, the emergency physician is likely treating cryptococcal meningitis. The presence of an increased lymphocyte count, elevated protein, and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indicative of an inflammatory response, which is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nIn the acute setting, the patient is also presenting with severe headache and fever, which are common symptoms of meningitis. The decision to initiate IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is a reasonable step in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nHowever, the patient's CD4 count of 47 is significantly low (T cell count of 47 cells/\u03bcL), indicating severe immunocompromise. This is a contraindication for intravenous amphotericin B, which is an antifungal medication that can be nephrotoxic and ototoxic. \n\nIn the acute setting, the patient may benefit from an alternative treatment that is safer for the patient's immunocompromised state. A possible alternative treatment in this scenario could be the use of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B or a combination of amphotericin B with other antifungal agents such as flucytosine, but not IV amphotericin B alone.\n\nIt is essential to monitor the patient closely for signs of treatment-related adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and adjust the treatment plan as needed to ensure the patient's safety.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to calculate the proportion of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and divide it by the total number of true negatives.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the proportion of true negatives:\nNumber of true negatives = 240 (from the study)\nNumber of false positives (from the study) = 5\n\nNPV = Number of true negatives / (Number of true negatives + Number of false positives)\nNPV = 240 / (240 + 5)\nNPV = 240 / 245\nNPV = 0.988\n\nNPV = 98.8%\n\nTherefore, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test is approximately 98.8%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is a stroke. The sudden onset of weakness in the right hand, particularly in a patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis, raises concern for an acute vascular event such as a stroke. The patient's temperature, blood pressure, and pulse are within normal limits, but the patient's neurological exam is abnormal, indicating some level of neurological impairment.\n\nThe patient's history of inconsistent adherence to his medications, including antiretroviral therapy, may be a contributing factor to his current condition, as it may indicate poor management of his HIV infection, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications.\n\nThe patient's father's history of myocardial infarction and mother's stroke may be relevant, but they do not directly relate to the patient's current presentation.\n\nThe next best step in management for this patient is to order a comprehensive neuroimaging study, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to rule out a stroke. This is to rule out other potential causes of his symptoms, such as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a vascular event. Additionally, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening neurological symptoms and any further deterioration in his condition.\n\nIt is also important to note that the patient's HIV status should be evaluated, as his immunosuppression may be contributing to his current condition. His HIV viral load should be checked, and his CD4 count should be monitored to assess the severity of his immunosuppression.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks' gestation, this patient is at a high risk for HIV exposure. Given her lack of personal and family history of serious illness, the risk factors for HIV are minimal. However, due to her age and pregnancy, there is an increased risk of other infections. The patient's HIV test result is negative, but it is essential to consider other potential risks.\n\nAt this visit, the following tests should be done:\n\n1. **Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody tests**: Since she has no previous test results, a screening is recommended to assess her current HIV status and hepatitis B and C infection.\n2. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test**: This test detects the presence of HBV antibodies, which indicates exposure to the virus. If negative, further testing is not necessary.\n3. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs test**: This test detects the presence of antibodies against HBV, which indicates immunity to the virus. If negative, further testing is recommended to assess the risk of infection.\n4. **HIV antibody test**: Although the patient's test result is negative, it is essential to consider the possibility of exposure to HIV through sexual contact. A repeat test or a confirmatory test should be done to assess her current HIV status.\n5. **Cervical screening**: Given the patient's age and the lack of previous test results, a Pap test or a LAM (Laminales and Mantle cells) test should be performed to assess cervical cell abnormalities.\n6. **Ultrasound**: To assess fetal development and monitor fetal growth, an ultrasound should be performed.\n\nThese tests will help identify any potential infections or issues and inform the clinician's management plan.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the newborn's birth weight and Apgar scores, the most critical concern is the mother's HIV status. Since the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, it's likely that she is on effective antiretroviral therapy. \n\nGiven the mother's viral load of 678 copies/mL, it's essential to monitor her for signs of viral suppression to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. However, since the viral load was not specified, we cannot confirm if the mother is currently on effective treatment.\n\nTo manage the newborn, the most appropriate next step is to:\n\n1. **Verify the mother's HIV status**: Confirm that the mother is on effective ART to prevent MTCT of HIV.\n2. **Monitor the newborn's Apgar scores**: Continue to monitor the newborn's Apgar scores to ensure they are within the normal range (7-10) for a newborn.\n3. **Perform a physical examination**: Perform a thorough physical examination of the newborn to look for any signs of illness or infection.\n4. **Consider HIV testing for the newborn**: If the mother is not on effective ART, consider HIV testing for the newborn to confirm the mother's HIV status.\n\nIt is essential to note that if the mother's viral load is not suppressed, the risk of MTCT of HIV increases, and the newborn may benefit from prophylactic antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent HIV infection.",
