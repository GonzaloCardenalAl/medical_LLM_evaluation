    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and the recent initiation of IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, it's essential to consider alternative treatments for suspected fungal infections. While Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in patients with HIV/AIDS due to its potential for severe toxicity, there are other options that may be considered in the acute setting.\n\nIn this scenario, considering the patient's CD4 count of 47, which is critically low (typically <200 cells/\u03bcL), the primary concern is managing her immune system suppression. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, headache, and fever, combined with the lumbar puncture results, are indicative of a central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as cryptococcal meningitis. \n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is **TAC (Tricyclic Antifungal Agents)**, specifically **Nifurofloxacin** or **Sulfadiazine**. These medications are effective against cryptococcal meningitis and can be used in patients with severe immunocompromise. However, it's crucial to note that the decision to use these medications should be made in consultation with an infectious disease specialist and the patient's HIV care team to avoid potential interactions and ensure the patient's overall treatment plan.\n\nThe patient's CD4 count of 47 is critically low, making it essential to prioritize her immune system's recovery and minimize further exposure to potentially toxic medications.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of the novel test, we need to know the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR).\n\nTPR is the number of true positives (correctly diagnosed as having AIDS) divided by the total number of patients who actually have AIDS. In this case, TPR = 240 / (240 + 5) = 240 / 245 \u2248 0.98.\n\nFPR is the number of false positives (incorrectly diagnosed as having AIDS) divided by the total number of patients who do not have AIDS. In this case, FPR = 5 / 245 \u2248 0.02.\n\nNPV is the ratio of True Negatives to (True Negatives + False Positives). First, we need to calculate the number of False Negatives (FN). FN = Total patients without AIDS - True Negatives = 250 - 240 = 10.\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives) = 240 / (240 + 10) = 240 / 250 \u2248 0.96.\n\nSo, the NPV of the novel test is approximately 96%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness, I would recommend further investigation into his recent history to identify potential causes, including potential drug-related causes, infections, and other systemic conditions.\n\nThe patient's history of inconsistent adherence to his medications, including the long-term use of itraconazole, is a significant concern. Itraconazole can cause peripheral neuropathy, which may explain the patient's weakness. However, I would like to confirm this by ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and renal function tests, to check for any potential metabolic or toxicities.\n\nI would also consider ordering a blood smear to rule out infectious causes, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections. Additionally, I would ask the patient about his travel history, as he has been to multiple countries, which could increase his risk for certain infections.\n\nGiven the patient's age and underlying medical conditions, I would recommend a thorough physical examination and laboratory evaluation to determine the cause of his weakness, which may include a lumbar puncture or MRI to rule out any neurological conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that the patient be admitted for observation and monitoring, and that his medications be adjusted as needed to prevent further complications.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, symptoms, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a diagnosis of Hypertensive Encephalopathy (HE) with Cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and difficulty with daily activities such as operating appliances suggest a possible cerebrovascular event. The patient's past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and noncompliance with medications may have contributed to his increased risk of cerebrovascular disease.\n\nThe laboratory results show elevated blood pressure, low hemoglobin, and low leukocyte count, which could indicate dehydration, malnutrition, or other complications of chronic illness. The Cryptococcal antigen negative test result rules out Cryptococcal meningitis, but the positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result suggests an ongoing infection. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect further support this diagnosis.\n\nHypertensive Encephalopathy is a common complication of uncontrolled hypertension, and the patient's elevated blood pressure may have contributed to the development of HE. Cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, is also a consideration, but the lack of specific symptoms such as fever, headache, or seizures makes it less likely.\n\nThe combination of these factors makes Hypertensive Encephalopathy with Cryptococcal meningitis the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
