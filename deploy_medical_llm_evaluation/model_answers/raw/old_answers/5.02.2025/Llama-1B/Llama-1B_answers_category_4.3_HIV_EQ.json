    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of severe fatigue, worsening headache, and fever, along with the findings on the lumbar puncture (LP), the patient's condition is highly suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis. The elevated lymphocytes, increased protein, and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) further support this diagnosis.\n\nIn the acute setting, in addition to IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, the following treatment may be warranted:\n\n1. **Antifungal prophylaxis**: To prevent further CNS involvement, the patient should be started on antifungal prophylaxis, such as fluconazole (e.g., Diflucan) or voriconazole, to cover for potential cryptococcal recurrence. This is typically started at the same time as the initial treatment.\n\n2. **Antibiotic coverage**: Although the patient is already receiving IV amphotericin B and flucytosine, it is essential to consider adding an antibiotic to cover for potential CNS opportunistic pathogens. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and the patient's specific clinical situation. However, for a patient with cryptococcal meningitis, the most commonly used antibiotics are amphotericin B, flucytosine, and sometimes amphotericin B with flucytosine.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to calculate the proportion of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and then divide it by the total number of patients without AIDS.\n\nGiven:\n- Number of patients with AIDS = 250\n- Number of patients with positive test result = 5\n- Number of patients without AIDS = 250\n- Number of patients without AIDS who test positive = 5\n\nFirst, calculate the proportion of patients without AIDS who test positive:\n5 / 250 = 0.02\n\nNow, calculate the NPV:\nNPV = (Number of patients without AIDS who test negative) / (Total number of patients without AIDS)\nNPV = 250 / 250\nNPV = 1\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test is 1, which means that 100% of patients without AIDS will test negative.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in the right hand, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Assess for Acute Dementia or Confusion**: The patient's temperature of 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C) and tachycardia (88/min) suggest an infectious process. I would order a blood cultures and a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection or inflammation.\n2. **Imaging Studies**: I would order a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, or other acute neurological conditions.\n3. **Lab Tests**: I would order a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and liver function tests to rule out underlying liver disease or electrolyte imbalances that could be contributing to his weakness.\n4. **Neurological Examination**: I would perform a thorough neurological examination to assess for signs of stroke, myelitis, or other neurological conditions.\n5. **Immunocompromised Status**: Given the patient's HIV diagnosis, I would also assess for signs of opportunistic infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis or pneumococcal meningitis, which are more common in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nIn the interim, I would also consider the possibility of an acute medical condition that could be contributing to his symptoms, such as a pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome.\n\nI would not order a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) without further evaluation of the patient's neurological symptoms and risk factors, as it may not provide a clear diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is **HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)**.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and difficulty with daily activities, such as operating kitchen appliances, are consistent with a diagnosis of HAND. The presence of neurological examination findings, including right lower extremity weakness and mild lymphadenopathy, also supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe laboratory results show an elevated HIV viral load, which is a known risk factor for HAND. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings also suggest that the patient may have an opportunistic infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common complication of HIV infection. The negative Cryptococcal antigen and positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG result help to rule out these other causes of lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect are also consistent with HAND, which is a type of HIV-associated dementia that can cause changes in the brain's white matter.\n\n HAND is a complex condition that requires careful evaluation and management, including antiretroviral therapy, antifungal prophylaxis, and supportive care.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks' gestation, this patient is at high risk for certain infections. \n\n1. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)**: Given her nulliparous status, she should be screened for HPV, which is associated with cervical cancer and genital warts. Her previous test result of negative HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis is not sufficient for this purpose. A screening test for HPV should be performed.\n\n2. **Hepatitis B**: Although she is up-to-date on her Hepatitis B vaccination, she should still be tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs (antibody to Hepatitis B surface antigen) to assess her current immunity status.\n\n3. **Syphilis**: Given her nulliparous status and the fact that she is 8 weeks pregnant, she should be tested for syphilis. The TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay) test is a recommended screening test for syphilis during pregnancy.\n\n4. **Genital Warts**: While she may have genital warts, there is no indication that she is at high risk for sexually transmitted infections. However, she should be advised on the importance of practicing safe sex and using condoms to prevent the transmission of other STIs.\n\n5. **Cervical Ultrasound**: Given her age and previous negative HPV test result, a cervical ultrasound should be performed to assess for any abnormalities in the cervix.\n\n6. **Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) testing**: Although not mentioned in the scenario, it is essential to screen for HTLV, a viral infection that can cause adult T-cell leukemia and other conditions. However, it is not typically recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3, which is below the normal range (500 cells/mm3), indicating significant immunosuppression.\n\nThe presence of skin lesions, particularly the vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, is highly suggestive of cutaneous tuberculosis (TB) or possibly lichen planus. However, the combination of symptoms and test results makes TB less likely.\n\nThe patient's history of intravenous drug use and crack cocaine use is concerning for a substance-induced skin condition, such as lichen planus or dermatomyositis. However, the biopsy results showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain are more indicative of a bacterial infection.\n\nConsidering the patient's immunosuppression, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be:\n\n1. **Antitubercular therapy**: To treat the likely TB infection.\n2. **Antibiotics**: To treat the bacterial infection.\n3. **Immunosuppressive therapy**: To manage the patient's immunosuppression and prevent further opportunistic infections.\n\nThe patient should be started on a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for TB, and doxycycline for the bacterial infection. The patient should also be advised to avoid further intravenous drug use and crack cocaine use.\n\nThe patient's BMI and lack of other risk factors for HIV-related opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, make it less likely. However, it is essential to continue monitoring for opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, and adjust treatment as needed based on clinical response and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count.\n\nPlease consult a specialist for further guidance on the patient's treatment plan.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, I would be cautious about the recent diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. While EBV can cause neurological symptoms, a positive PCR for EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a significant finding. However, I must emphasize that this alone does not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of ataxia, apathy, and slight pleocytosis in the CSF are concerning, but can be seen in various conditions, including HIV-related neurocognitive disorders, infections, and other inflammatory conditions.\n\nThe MRI showing a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is highly suggestive of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), a rare brain disorder that can cause ataxia, cognitive decline, and visual disturbances. However, PSP can also be associated with EBV infection, particularly in the context of HIV.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy and the recent onset of neurological symptoms, I would recommend a more detailed evaluation, including:\n\n1. A thorough neurocognitive assessment to rule out other causes of cognitive decline.\n2. Further testing for other potential causes of ataxia, such as vitamin deficiencies, multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory conditions.\n3. Follow-up with the patient to monitor the progression of the neurological symptoms and the size of the ring-enhancing lesion on MRI.\n\nIn the meantime, I would advise the patient to continue taking his antiretroviral therapy as prescribed, as his HIV status is still being monitored.\n\nI would like to emphasize that a definitive diagnosis of PSP would require more specific diagnostic tests, such as the NMDA receptor antibody test, and further evaluation by a neurologist. I would be happy to discuss these options with the patient and provide guidance on the next steps.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the newborn's Apgar score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively, and the mother's HIV viral load of 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, the newborn is considered to be in good health.\n\nSince the mother has received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the newborn's HIV viral load is likely to be undetectable. Therefore, the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is considered to be low.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to monitor the newborn closely for any signs of HIV infection or other maternal-to-infant transmission. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newborns of HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis (ART) to prevent MTCT of HIV. This is typically done through a combination of antiretroviral therapy for the mother and prophylactic antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the newborn.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
