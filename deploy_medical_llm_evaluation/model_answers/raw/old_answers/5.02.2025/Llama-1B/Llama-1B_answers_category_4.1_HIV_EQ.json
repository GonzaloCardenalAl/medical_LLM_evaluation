    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and lab results, it appears that this patient is likely experiencing a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, possibly cryptococcal meningitis. The presence of increased lymphocytes, protein, and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supports this diagnosis.\n\nIn the acute setting, the addition of antifungal therapy is warranted. \n\nHowever, IV amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, which may not be necessary for cryptococcal meningitis. Instead, the preferred initial treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is voriconazole (or amphotericin B for severe cases) administered orally (PO) for at least 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole (or amphotericin B for severe cases) for at least 4 weeks. \n\nThe patient's CD4 count is low, which makes her immunocompromised and more susceptible to opportunistic infections. The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, and the presence of lymphocytosis in the CSF supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's CD4 count, she is not a suitable candidate for IV amphotericin B.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel test, we need to compare the number of true negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative) to the total number of patients who tested negative.\n\nNumber of true negatives (TN) = 250 (patients with AIDS) - 5 (patients with AIDS and positive test) = 245\nNumber of patients tested negative (NT) = 250 (total patients) - 5 (patients with AIDS and positive test) = 245\n\nNPV = TN / NT = 245 / 245 = 1",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a stroke, likely ischemic given the sudden onset of weakness and the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. \n\nThe patient's history of taking raltegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine, which are all antiretroviral medications, is relevant, but the patient's history of myocardial infarction and stroke in his father and mother does not directly suggest a direct link to his current condition. The patient's current symptoms and lab results do not indicate a clear cause of his stroke, but the patient's recent inconsistent adherence to his medications may be a contributing factor to his condition.\n\nThe patient's temperature, blood pressure, and pulse are all within normal limits, and the neurological exam is normal, which suggests that there is no acute infection or other acute process causing his symptoms. \n\nThe next best step in management is to order an electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate for signs of a stroke, as well as to assess the patient's neurological status and rule out other potential causes of his symptoms. This will help to determine the extent of the damage and guide further management.\n\nIt's also worth considering the possibility of a medication side effect or an underlying condition such as a vitamin deficiency or electrolyte imbalance, but these would require further investigation and monitoring before proceeding to more invasive procedures.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is **HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)**. The patient's symptoms of leg weakness, unsteady gait, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, and recent onset of paranoia, agitation, and restlessness are consistent with HAND, a common complication of HIV infection. The patient's noncompliance with his medications, low CD4+ count, and high HIV viral load also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe presence of mild lymphadenopathy, normal neurological examination, and the MRI findings of nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect are also consistent with HAND. The Cryptococcal antigen negative test result and Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms, but rather to his HIV infection status.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At 8 weeks of gestation, the following tests are recommended for this patient:\n\n1. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test**: Given her history of chlamydia and gonorrhea, it's essential to screen for hepatitis B to assess for potential vertical transmission to the fetus.\n\n2. **Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B vaccine (if not already administered)**: Administer the HBIG to provide immediate protection and boosters as recommended by the CDC, if necessary.\n\n3. **Pap smear for cervical cancer screening**: Although the patient is nulliparous (has never given birth), it's still recommended to screen for cervical cancer, as the risk of cervical cancer increases with age and reproductive history.\n\n4. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test**: Given her age and reproductive history, it's recommended to screen for HPV to assess the risk of cervical cancer.\n\n5. **Blood glucose test**: Although not directly related to her current health, it's a good idea to check for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as it can affect fetal development and the mother's health.\n\n6. **HIV screening (again)**: Although the patient tested negative 4 years ago, it's essential to re-screen to ensure she's not infected and to monitor for any changes in her HIV status.\n\nThese tests will help identify any potential health concerns and ensure the best care for the patient and her unborn child.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and biopsy results, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV infection, not directly addressing the skin lesions. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is below 500, indicating severe immunosuppression, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and certain types of cancers.\n\nThe presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain suggests a fungal infection, likely oral candidiasis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts. Therefore, antifungal therapy, such as fluconazole, would be the most appropriate treatment.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's history of intravenous drug use and crack cocaine use increases her risk of developing opportunistic infections, including HIV-related conditions such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Close monitoring for PCP is necessary, and the patient should be considered for prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\nThe patient's high BMI (19 kg/m2) also increases her risk of non-HIV-related comorbidities, and her skin lesions, although non-pruritic and painless, may be a manifestation of her underlying condition. However, the biopsy results do not provide a clear diagnosis of a specific condition, and further diagnostic testing, such as skin biopsies or imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the nature of the skin lesions.\n\nIt is essential to work closely with the patient to manage her HIV infection, optimize her ART regimen, and monitor for any signs of opportunistic infections or other complications.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is HIV infection. Given the patient's CD4 count of 600 cells/\u03bcl, which is significantly below the normal range (1500-1800 cells/\u03bcl), the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections and other complications.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of increased sweating at night, wet sheets, clammy skin, and weight loss despite a normal appetite suggest a possible opportunistic infection such as Cryptococcosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nThe patient's treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is likely to be effective in controlling the HIV infection, but it may not be sufficient to prevent opportunistic infections.\n\nThe patient is at greatest risk for opportunistic infections such as:\n\n* Cryptococcosis\n* Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n* Kaposi's sarcoma\n* Mucormycosis\n* Tuberculosis\n* Toxoplasmosis\n* Candidiasis (oral thrush)\n\nIt is essential to monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of these opportunistic infections and to adjust treatment as needed to prevent complications.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, and current symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, apathy, low Mini-Mental State Examination score, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA), the most likely diagnosis is **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**.\n\nPML is a rare and opportunistic viral infection caused by the JC virus, which is more common in individuals with severely immunocompromised HIV/AIDS. The patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, which may have compromised his immune system, increases his susceptibility to PML. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum on MRI is a characteristic finding in PML.\n\nThe positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid further supports this diagnosis. PML is typically characterized by a progressive neurological decline, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nIt is essential to note that PML can be challenging to diagnose, as the clinical presentation can be non-specific, and the diagnosis is often made based on imaging findings and PCR results. A repeat MRI scan with contrast and PCR may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the information provided, the most appropriate next step in managing this infant is to follow up with the mother to discuss postnatal care and follow-up for the newborn. The newborn's birth weight is 5 lb 1 oz, which is below the expected average for this gestational age, suggesting potential growth restriction. The mother's HIV viral load is 678 copies/mL, which is considered undetectable, and the newborn's Apgar scores are 7 and 8, indicating good overall health. However, the mother's HIV status is unknown. \n\nIt is crucial to determine the mother's viral load status to ensure the newborn's safety and to monitor for any potential HIV transmission. The baby's birth weight is below average, which may require further evaluation and monitoring for potential growth and development issues. A follow-up appointment with the mother is essential to discuss postnatal care and follow-up for the newborn.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
