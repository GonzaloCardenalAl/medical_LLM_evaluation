    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "The molecular process that could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed is vitamin C denaturation. Vitamin C is a heat-sensitive nutrient that can be denatured if exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. This can lead to a loss of vitamin C in the formula, which is essential for the baby's growth and development. Therefore, it is recommended to heat the formula to the appropriate temperature and not to overheat it to prevent vitamin C denaturation.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."
