    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "It is generally agreed upon in the medical community that age at diagnosis and the initial CD4 count are important predictors of HIV disease progression. However, there are various studies that suggest that the rate of CD4 decline does not differ significantly between individuals who are diagnosed before or after the age of 20, provided that their initial CD4 count is above 300. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be a significant difference in the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200 between PWH tested before or after the age of 20, if their initial CD4 count is above 300.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
