    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient with HIV infection and low CD4 count is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain, eye, or spinal cord and is more common in immunocompromised patients such as those with advanced HIV infection. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis and positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA supports this diagnosis, as EBV has been associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients. The MRI findings of a solitary, ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum are also consistent with PCNSL. A biopsy of the lesion is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother boils the formula longer than needed, the Vitamin C could be inactivated due to heat, and the molecular process that could be impaired is the oxidation-reduction reaction. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps in maintaining the redox balance in the body. Its inactivation could lead to an imbalance in the redox potential, resulting in oxidative stress and cellular damage.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Didanosine is known to cause pancreatitis as a side effect. Therefore, the patient should be switched to another antiretroviral drug that does not have this side effect. The other medications she is taking, zidovudine and efavirenz, are not commonly associated with pancreatitis. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of pancreatitis, and liver enzyme tests should be conducted regularly.",

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed by the physician scientist is the gp120 protein, which is the envelope glycoprotein of HIV that is responsible for binding to CD4 receptors on T-cells and facilitating entry into the host cell. This protein is highly immunogenic and is the target of many neutralizing antibodies that are produced by the natural humoral immune response.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the physician has a duty to maintain patient confidentiality as part of the patient-physician relationship. However, the physician also has a duty to protect the patient's spouse from potential harm. In some jurisdictions, there are laws that require physicians to report certain infectious diseases, including HIV. However, even in the absence of such laws, the physician should counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his diagnosis to his spouse and encourage him to do so. The physician should also offer to help the patient in any way possible to facilitate this discussion. If the patient still refuses to disclose his diagnosis to his spouse, the physician should consider reporting the diagnosis to the appropriate health authorities, as this may help prevent further transmission of the virus. Ultimately, the physician must balance their duty to maintain patient confidentiality with their duty to protect the public health.",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

Initial in vitro experiments would involve the use of HIV-infected cell lines or primary cells to study the function and expression of specific microRNAs in relation to HIV replication and pathogenesis . This research would provide insights into the potential roles of microRNAs in HIV infection and help identify candidate microRNAs for therapeutic targeting . Next, in vivo animal models, such as humanized mice, should be employed to study the effects of modulating specific microRNAs on HIV infection and disease progression . These models would help evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential microRNA-based therapies, as well as investigate the potential for off-target effects and immunogenicity . Techniques such as delivery of microRNA mimics or antagomirs, viral vector-mediated overexpression or knockdown, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing can be used to manipulate microRNA expression in these models  . Finally, clinical trials should be conducted to validate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of potential microRNA-based therapies in HIV patients . These trials would involve the enrollment of HIV-positive patients to receive the experimental treatment(s) under controlled conditions, with rigorous monitoring of viral load, treatment-related adverse events, immune function, and other relevant parameters .
