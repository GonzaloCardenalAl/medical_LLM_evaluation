    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV diagnosis is made through laboratory testing of blood or oral fluid samples. The most common tests used are the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the Western blot test. ELISA detects antibodies to HIV in the blood, while the Western blot test confirms the presence of specific HIV antibodies. Rapid tests which provide results in 20 minutes are also available. A positive test result requires a confirmatory test, usually by Western blot. It's recommended that HIV testing be done at least 3 months after exposure to ensure accurate results.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV infection can be divided into three stages: acute infection, clinical latency, and AIDS. Acute infection is the initial stage of HIV infection that occurs immediately after exposure and can last for several weeks. Clinical latency is the second stage where the virus is not active and the infected person may not experience any symptoms. Finally, AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection where the immune system is severely weakened, making the person susceptible to life-threatening infections and diseases.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at increased risk for a variety of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hepatitis C virus infection, tuberculosis, certain cancers, and mental health disorders. The risk of these comorbidities may be increased due to immunosuppression, chronic inflammation, long-term antiretroviral therapy, and lifestyle factors. Effective management of HIV and comorbidities requires a comprehensive approach and close collaboration between healthcare providers.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "## Preventing HIV\n\nThere are several ways to prevent HIV:\n\n1. **Abstinence**: Avoiding sexual activity altogether.\n2. **Monogamy**: Having sex with only one partner, who is HIV-negative and remains faithful.\n3. **Correct and Consistent Use of Condoms**: Using condoms correctly during every sexual encounter.\n4. **HIV Testing**: Knowing your HIV status and your partner's status before starting a sexual relationship.\n5. **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Taking medication daily to prevent HIV infection for people who are at high risk.\n6. **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**: Taking medication within 72 hours after exposure to HIV to prevent infection.\n7. **Avoiding Sharing Needles or Syringes**: Not sharing needles or syringes when injecting drugs to prevent HIV transmission.\n8. **Safer Sex Practices**: Practicing safer sex, such as using dental dams during oral sex or using gloves during anal sex.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

    "question": "How frequently ART must be taken?",
    "answer": "ART (antiretroviral therapy) must be taken daily, as prescribed by your healthcare provider, in order to effectively manage and control HIV infection. Skipping doses or taking medications irregularly can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure.",
    "true_answer": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken as a pill every day or as a shot once every month or two months."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "## HIV Latency and Reactivation\n\n### Switch from Latent to Active Infection\n\nThe switch from latent HIV infection to active infection is not fully understood and requires further research. However, it is believed that the reactivation of latent HIV is influenced by various factors, including:\n\n### Key Factors:\n\n- **Host Immune System**: The body's immune response plays a crucial role in controlling viral replication and reactivation.\n- **Viral Load**: The amount of HIV present in the body can impact the likelihood of reactivation.\n- **Co-Infections**: Presence of other infections, such as tuberculosis, can increase the risk of HIV reactivation.\n- **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Discontinuation or interruption of ART can lead to viral reactivation.\n- **Genetic Factors**: Certain genetic mutations may affect the ability of the virus to reactivate.\n\n### Current Understanding:\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms behind the switch from latent to active HIV infection are not fully understood, research continues to uncover the complex interplay between host and viral factors.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
