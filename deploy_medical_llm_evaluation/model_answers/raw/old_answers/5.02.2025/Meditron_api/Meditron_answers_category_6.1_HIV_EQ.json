    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the lumbar puncture, the likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. The standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, which have already been initiated. However, in the acute setting, the patient may also benefit from a lumbar puncture with removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to relieve the increased intracranial pressure. This procedure may be repeated several times over the course of the patient's treatment to ensure that the pressure remains under control and to prevent complications such as brain herniation.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "The NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of this novel AIDS screening examination can be calculated as:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nwhere TN is the number of true negatives and FN is the number of false negatives.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n\n- 240 patients with confirmed AIDS tested positive on the novel screening examination.\n- 5 patients without AIDS tested positive on the novel screening examination.\n- Therefore, TN = 245 (250 - 5) and FN = 10 (250 - 240).\n\nSo, the NPV can be calculated as:\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 = 0.96 or 96%.\n\nTherefore, the NPV of this novel AIDS screening examination is 96%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's sudden neurological deficits and fever, the most concerning diagnosis would be cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The next best step would be to perform a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine should be started empirically while awaiting the results of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Itraconazole is not the first-line treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "The patient has a low CD4 count and has not been adhering to his anti-retroviral therapy for six months, which puts him at risk for opportunistic infections. In addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy, he should be started on Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis with either Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole or Dapsone. Additionally, he should be started on prophylaxis for other opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) with Azithromycin or Clarithromycin, and Toxoplasma gondii with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole. Fluconazole is used for prophylaxis against Candidiasis, which may also be considered in this patient. The patient should also be evaluated for depression and offered appropriate treatment to help him adhere to his medications.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, low CD4+ T-lymphocytes count, positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, and a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is more common in immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with HIV. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with PCNSL, and the positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the CSF supports this diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The next step in management of this infant would be to administer zidovudine to the baby as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 6-12 hours. This is because zidovudine has been shown to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV when given to both the mother and the baby. The baby should also be closely monitored for any signs of HIV infection, including regular viral load testing.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
