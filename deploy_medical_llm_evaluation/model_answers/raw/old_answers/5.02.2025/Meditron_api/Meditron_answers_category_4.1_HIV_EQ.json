    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "This patient has a clinical picture consistent with central nervous system (CNS) fungal infection, most likely cryptococcal meningitis given her immunocompromised status. The elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture may indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which is a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis. In addition to antifungal therapy, this patient may require serial lumbar punctures or even a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to manage the elevated ICP and prevent complications such as blindness, hearing loss, and even death. Close monitoring of her ICP and neurologic status will be necessary during her hospitalization.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "The NPV of this novel test can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nNPV = true negatives / (true negatives + false negatives)\n\nIn this study, there were 245 true negatives (patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination) and 5 false positives (patients without AIDS who tested positive on the screening examination). There were 240 true positives (patients with AIDS who tested positive on the screening examination) and 10 false negatives (patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination).\n\nTherefore, the NPV of this novel test is:\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 96.2%\n\nThis indicates that the probability of a patient not having AIDS given a negative screening result is 96.2%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "The patient's sudden onset of weakness in one extremity without sensory deficits suggests a possible diagnosis of a stroke. Given his medical history of HIV, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of cardiovascular events, the patient is at increased risk for stroke. The next best step would be to order an urgent CT scan of the head to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, followed by a CT angiogram or MRI to identify any possible ischemic stroke. The patient should also undergo a cardiac evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for any cardiac abnormalities that could have led to embolic stroke. Additionally, the patient's HIV viral load and CD4 count should be checked to assess the status of his HIV infection.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation of cognitive impairment, personality changes, and motor deficits in the setting of advanced immunocompromise suggests a diagnosis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load also support the likelihood of HAND.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count and history of non-adherence to his HIV medications, he should be started on prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The CDC recommends Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis for patients with a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3. The preferred regimen for PCP prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) taken daily. Additionally, the patient should be screened for other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis. The patient should also be referred to a mental health provider to address his depression and any barriers to adherence to his HIV medications.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."
