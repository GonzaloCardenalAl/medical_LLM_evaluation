    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the most likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients with low CD4 counts.\n\nChloramphenicol is not typically used for treating cryptococcal meningitis. The current treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is correct.\n\nIn addition to the current treatment, a lumbar puncture with a follow-up CSF analysis in 24-48 hours is recommended to assess for clearance of the organism and improvement in CSF parameters. This is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that this patient's CD4 count of 47 is very low, indicating advanced immunosuppression. Therefore, it is crucial to consider antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve the patient's immune function and reduce the risk of further opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and the number of false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative). \n\nWe know that 250 patients without AIDS were tested, and 5 tested positive, so 245 patients without AIDS tested negative. \n\nWe also know that 240 patients with AIDS tested positive. To find the number of false negatives, we need to subtract the number of true positives (240) from the total number of patients with AIDS (250), which is 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula: NPV = (True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)).\n\nNPV = (245 / (245 + 10)) \nNPV = 245 / 255\nNPV = 0.96 or 96%\n\nSo, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel test is 96%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness and fever, I would recommend ordering an urgent MRI of the brain and/or spine to rule out central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis, which are common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. \n\nBefore starting the MRI, I would also order a lumbar puncture (LP) to check for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure and to obtain CSF for analysis, including culture, Gram stain, and cryptococcal antigen testing. \n\nAdditionally, given the patient's inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART), I would recommend restarting his ART as soon as possible, ideally with a fully suppressive regimen. \n\nThe use of itraconazole for 10 years without a clear indication for a fungal infection is concerning, and I would consider stopping itraconazole and replacing it with a more appropriate antifungal agent if indicated by the patient's test results.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The patient's CD4 count of 56/\u03bcL and high HIV viral load suggest advanced HIV disease, which increases the risk of HAND. The presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI is consistent with HIV-associated leukoencephalopathy, a form of HAND.\n\nWhile vascular dementia is a possibility, the patient's history of HIV and the MRI findings make it less likely. The patient's symptoms, such as right lower extremity weakness, confusion, and difficulty with daily activities, are also more consistent with HAND than vascular dementia.\n\nIt's worth noting that Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity is a concern in HIV patients, but the serum cryptococcal antigen is negative, making opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis less likely.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "I can't recommend a specific treatment plan without considering the patient's individual needs and medical history. However, I can provide general information.\n\nGiven the patient's severely low CD4 count (33 cells/mm3), they are at high risk for opportunistic infections. \n\nThe patient likely needs antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV, which consists of multiple medications to suppress the virus. In addition to ART, the patient may require prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections.\n\nConsidering the patient's low CD4 count and potential for fungal infections, a medication like Fluconazole (an antifungal) might be prescribed for prophylaxis against cryptococcal meningitis. However, this is not the only consideration.\n\nThe patient also may benefit from prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or Dapsone, and for Toxoplasma gondii with Pyrimethamine-Sulfadiazine.\n\nIt's crucial to consult with the patient's primary care physician or an HIV specialist to determine the best course of treatment based on the patient's individual needs and medical history.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae, often seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4 count and history of IV drug use, it's essential to consider the possibility of co-infections and potential resistance to traditional treatments. \n\nThe use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years is concerning, as it may have contributed to the development of resistance. \n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bartonella henselae infection is a combination of Azithromycin and Rifampicin. This combination has been shown to be effective in treating BA, and it is less likely to have contributed to resistance given the history of sulfonamide use.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's current treatment regimen of lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects, specifically pancreatitis, given that indinavir is a known causative agent of pancreatitis.\n\nHowever, since you've mentioned that a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect was recently prescribed, I'm assuming you're asking about potential adverse effects of a new treatment. \n\nBased on the information provided, it's likely that you've replaced indinavir with another protease inhibitor. Common protease inhibitors that can cause pancreatitis include atazanavir, darunavir, and lopinavir.\n\nTherefore, the patient is likely at greatest risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects, including pancreatitis, due to the new protease inhibitor.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), specifically Primary CNS Lymphoma associated with HIV. \n\nThe key points supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n1. The patient's history of HIV and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, which has likely led to a compromised immune system.\n2. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, which is a classic feature of PCNSL.\n3. The positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is a common association with PCNSL.\n4. The patient's neurological symptoms, such as ataxia, apathy, and cognitive decline, are consistent with PCNSL.\n\nWhile Glioblastoma is a possibility, the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF and the patient's immunocompromised state make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis. Further diagnostic workup, such as a biopsy of the brain lesion, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this infant would be to administer zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis to the newborn. \n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all HIV-exposed newborns should receive zidovudine prophylaxis for 6 weeks. This is regardless of the mother's viral load, as the goal is to prevent mother-to-child transmission.\n\nIn this case, since the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and had a viral load of 678 copies/mL, the risk of transmission is lower. However, zidovudine prophylaxis is still necessary to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
