    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nReasoning:\n\n- The patient has HIV infection with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL), making her immunocompromised.\n- The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggests an opportunistic infection, which is consistent with PML.\n- The MRI findings of a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders in the corpus callosum are consistent with PML, which typically presents with such lesions.\n\nNote that PML is a rare and serious condition caused by the JC virus (a polyomavirus) that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "answer": "If the mother overheats the formula, the Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) in it can be broken down or denatured. This is due to a process called oxidation, where the heat causes the Vitamin C molecule to lose its hydrogen atoms, leading to its inactivation.",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, it's essential to adjust her antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Didanosine is known to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, especially at higher doses.\n\nTo minimize the risk of pancreatitis recurrence, the following precautions can be taken:\n\n1.  **Discontinue didanosine**: Stopping didanosine is crucial to prevent further pancreatitis. This will be replaced by another antiretroviral medication in the patient's regimen.\n2.  **Monitor for viral rebound**: Since didanosine is being discontinued, closely monitor the patient's viral load and CD4 count to ensure that her HIV is not rebounding.\n3.  **Adjust the regimen**: Consider adding or switching to alternative antiretroviral medications that are less likely to cause pancreatitis, such as tenofovir, emtricitabine, or raltegravir.\n4.  **Regular follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's response to the new regimen and address any concerns or side effects.\n\nIt's essential to consult with an infectious disease specialist or an HIV expert to determine the best course of action for this patient.",

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "answer": "The HIV envelope proteins are a complex, but the primary targets of the humoral immune response are the gp120 and gp41 subunits of the envelope protein. These two subunits form the trimeric envelope spike, which facilitates viral entry into host cells.\n\nAmong the gp120 and gp41 subunits, gp41 is a more promising target for antibody-based therapies. gp41 is a transmembrane protein that forms a six-helix bundle structure, which is crucial for the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Antibodies targeting gp41 can inhibit viral entry by preventing this fusion process.\n\nThe physician scientist is likely designing an antibody against gp41, as it is a critical component of the HIV envelope and a key target for neutralizing antibodies.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."
