    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, the likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. \n\nIn addition to amphotericin B and flucytosine, the patient may benefit from:\n\n1. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: Initiating or adjusting the patient's ART regimen to achieve viral suppression and improve immune function. This is crucial for managing the underlying HIV infection and preventing further opportunistic infections.\n2. **Fluconazole or other antifungal prophylaxis**: After completing the initial treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine, fluconazole can be used for long-term suppression of Cryptococcus neoformans.\n3. **Steroids (dexamethasone)**: There is some evidence to suggest that steroids may reduce inflammation and improve outcomes in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, especially those with high intracranial pressure.\n4. **Close monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP)**: Regular lumbar punctures or imaging studies may be necessary to monitor for increased ICP, which can be a life-threatening complication of cryptococcal meningitis.\n5. **Supportive care**: Management of symptoms, such as pain, fever, and fatigue, with medications like acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and antipyretics as needed.\n\nIt's essential to consult with an infectious disease specialist for further guidance on managing this patient's care.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives in both groups.\n\nIn the control arm (no AIDS), 5 patients tested positive, so the remaining patients (250 - 5 = 245) are true negatives.\n\nIn the AIDS group, 240 patients tested positive, so the remaining patients (250 - 240 = 10) are true negatives.\n\nThe total number of true negatives is 245 (control arm) + 10 (AIDS arm) = 255.\n\nThe total number of patients is 250 (control arm) + 250 (AIDS arm) = 500.\n\nThe NPV is the number of true negatives divided by the total number of patients without AIDS (i.e., the control arm): 245 / 500 = 0.49 or 49%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness, fever, and low CD4 count, the next best step in management is to consider the possibility of an opportunistic infection, particularly central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy. However, the sudden onset of weakness with preserved sensation is more suggestive of a stroke or a peripheral nerve disorder.\n\nI would order an urgent non-contrast head CT to rule out a stroke or hemorrhage. Additionally, I would obtain an HIV viral load and CD4 count to assess the patient's immune status. \n\nBefore any other diagnostic tests, I would also ask the patient about any recent changes in his medication adherence, as inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be contributing to his immunocompromised state.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD) or HIV-associated minor cognitive motor disorder (MCD). The patient's history of noncompliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a low CD4+ count of 56/\u03bcL, along with a high HIV viral load, suggest a poor immune status, which increases the risk of HIV-related complications, including neurological involvement.\n\nThe presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on the MRI, along with the patient's cognitive and motor symptoms, supports this diagnosis. The Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result is not unexpected, as it is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, but the serum cryptococcal antigen is negative, making cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n\nIt is essential to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and manage the patient's HIV-related symptoms and complications promptly to prevent further progression of the disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What following tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history and current presentation, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. **Urinalysis**: To screen for glucose, protein, and ketones, which are essential for monitoring renal function and potential gestational diabetes.\n2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To evaluate for anemia, which is common in pregnancy, and to assess for any signs of infection.\n3. **Blood Type and Rh Factor**: To determine blood type and Rh factor, as this information is crucial for future pregnancy management and potential blood transfusions.\n4. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening**: Although the patient tested negative for Chlamydia and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago, GBS screening is recommended at 35-37 weeks of gestation. However, some studies suggest that screening at 24-28 weeks might be beneficial. We can consider screening at this visit to get a head start on GBS status.\n5. **Prenatal screening for anemia and iron deficiency**: Given the patient's BMI of 24.3 kg/m2, which is in the normal range, but not high enough to classify her as overweight or obese, we should assess her iron status and anemia risk.\n6. **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**: Although the patient has a negative HIV test, it's essential to screen for Hepatitis B, as it's a separate infection.\n7. **Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A)**: This test is part of the first-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.\n8. **Ultrasound**: A dating ultrasound to confirm the gestational age, fetal viability, and to assess for any potential fetal anomalies.\n\nPlease note that the patient's previous negative tests for Chlamydia and Neisseria gonorrhoeae do not eliminate the need for a more recent screening. It's recommended to screen for these infections at the time of the first prenatal visit.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, it's essential to address the severe immunocompromise and potential opportunistic infections. \n\nFirst, we need to get him back on his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the virus and increase his CD4 count. Then, I would recommend treating him for potential opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or dapsone. \n\nAdditionally, I would also consider prescribing prophylaxis for Toxoplasma gondii (if seropositive) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease. Given his low CD4 count, I would also recommend a fluconazole or itraconazole for cryptococcal meningitis prophylaxis.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to address his depression first, as it's a significant factor in his non-adherence. We should consider referring him to a mental health professional for treatment.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and biopsy findings, I would suspect cutaneous sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, which is often associated with trauma to the skin. However, the presence of black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain and vascular proliferation in the biopsy suggests a different diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's history of IV drug use and the presence of black bacteria, I'm more concerned about cat-scratch disease (Bartonellosis) or a bacterial infection, but the black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is not typical for these conditions.\n\nHowever, the presence of small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which is a silver stain used to detect certain bacteria, is suggestive of Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat-scratch disease. \n\nConsidering the patient's immunocompromised state (low CD4 count) and symptoms, I would recommend treating with Azithromycin 500mg PO daily for 6 weeks, which is a common treatment for Bartonella infections, including cat-scratch disease.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Based on the treatment regimen started, the patient is at greatest risk for nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal side effects, particularly with indinavir.\n\nIndinavir is a protease inhibitor that can cause nephrotoxicity, which can manifest as acute kidney injury or worsening renal function. This is more likely in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking other nephrotoxic medications.\n\nAdditionally, indinavir can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. These side effects are often dose-dependent and can be managed with dose reduction or switching to a different protease inhibitor.\n\nLamivudine and zidovudine are generally well-tolerated, but lamivudine can cause liver enzyme elevations and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, particularly anemia and neutropenia. However, these side effects are less likely in this case given the patient's normal physical examination and lack of symptoms suggestive of bone marrow suppression.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV and recent inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, along with the MRI findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nThe presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, slight pleocytosis, and PCR positivity for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid are all consistent with PCNSL, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the central nervous system and is often associated with EBV infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals like those with HIV.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the patient's low CD4 count (90/\u03bcL) and recent history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy may have contributed to his increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies, such as PCNSL.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management of this infant is to administer zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis. This is because the mother has HIV, and the infant is at risk for HIV transmission. The mother's viral load is still detectable, which increases the risk of transmission. Administering zidovudine to the infant within the first 6 hours of life has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
