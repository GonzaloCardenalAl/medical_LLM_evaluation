    "question": "How is HIV diagnosed?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) diagnosis typically involves a combination of tests. The primary methods include:\n\n1. **Rapid HIV tests**: These are quick, point-of-care tests that detect the presence of HIV antibodies or antigens in a person's blood or oral fluid. Results are usually available within 15-60 minutes.\n2. **Blood tests**: These are laboratory-based tests that detect the presence of HIV antibodies, antigens, or the virus itself in the blood. They are more sensitive and specific than rapid tests.\n3. **Fourth-generation tests**: These tests detect both HIV antibodies and antigens, providing earlier detection of HIV infection.\n4. **Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**: These tests detect the genetic material of the virus in the blood, providing the earliest detection of HIV infection.\n5. **Western blot confirmation**: If a rapid or blood test is positive, a Western blot test is used to confirm the result by detecting specific antibodies against HIV.\n\nThese tests are usually conducted on a blood sample, but some rapid tests can be done on oral fluid or urine.",
    "true_answer": "HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive"

    "question": "What are the different stages of HIV?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection progresses through several stages. Here are the main stages:\n\n1. **Acute HIV infection**: This is the initial stage, usually occurring within 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus. During this stage, the virus replicates rapidly, and the person may experience flu-like symptoms.\n2. **Clinical latency** (also known as chronic HIV infection): This stage can last for many years, even decades. The virus continues to replicate, but at a slower rate. People with HIV may not experience symptoms, but the virus is still active and can be transmitted to others.\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: This is the final stage of HIV infection, characterized by a severely weakened immune system (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm\u00b3). At this stage, people with HIV are susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers.\n\nIt's worth noting that with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the progression from acute infection to AIDS has slowed significantly, and many people with HIV are now living long, healthy lives.",
    "true_answer": "The different stages of HIV are either defined as three: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or four: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic stage, (3) symptomatic HIV, and (4) Late-stage HIV or AIDS."

    "question": "What comorbidities are common among people living with HIV?",
    "answer": "People living with HIV are at an increased risk of various comorbidities due to the disease itself, its treatment, and the associated lifestyle factors. Some common comorbidities include:\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke.\n2.  **Liver disease**: Hepatitis B and C co-infection, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\n3.  **Kidney disease**: HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and chronic kidney disease.\n4.  **Neurocognitive disorders**: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which can range from mild cognitive impairment to HIV-associated dementia.\n5.  **Osteoporosis**: Due to the use of certain antiretroviral therapies, which can interfere with bone health.\n6.  **Mental health conditions**: Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.\n7.  **Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)**: A condition that occurs when the immune system is restored after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) and reacts to latent infections.\n8.  **Cancer**: Increased risk of certain cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer.\n9.  **Malnutrition**: Due to chronic inflammation, gastrointestinal issues, and decreased appetite.\n10. **Bone marrow failure**: Aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nThese comorbidities can be managed through regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and treatment. It's essential for individuals living with HIV to work closely with their healthcare providers to prevent, diagnose, and manage these conditions.",
    "true_answer": "The most common comorbidities amongst patients with HIV include: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. hypertension), respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and pneumonia), and hepatic diseases (hepatitis B and C). Liver disease, renal disease, substance dependence and abuse, sexually transmitted infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium) and psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment) are also greater among HIV-positive individuals."

    "question": "How can HIV be prevented?",
    "answer": "HIV can be prevented through several methods:\n\n1. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medications daily to prevent HIV infection in individuals at high risk.\n2. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Taking antiretroviral medications within 72 hours after potential HIV exposure to prevent infection.\n3. **Safe sex practices**: Using condoms consistently and correctly during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\n4. **Needle exchange programs**: Using sterile needles and syringes to prevent blood-borne transmission through injecting drug use.\n5. **Hepatitis B vaccination**: Reduces the risk of co-infection with HIV and hepatitis B.\n6. **HIV testing and screening**: Identifying and treating HIV early can prevent transmission to others.\n7. **Abstinence**: Avoiding sex or injecting drug use altogether.\n\nIt's essential to note that no method is 100% effective, and combining multiple methods can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding."

  {
    "question": "How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?",
    "answer": "Preventing perinatal transmission of HIV involves a multi-faceted approach. Key measures include:\n\n1. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the mother**: Initiating ART during pregnancy, ideally before 14-20 weeks, reduces the viral load and significantly decreases the risk of transmission.\n\n2. **Elective cesarean delivery**: Delivering via cesarean section can reduce the risk of transmission if the mother's viral load is not well-controlled. However, vaginal delivery is still an option if the mother's viral load is undetectable.\n\n3. **Breastfeeding precautions**: HIV-positive mothers should not breastfeed their babies to prevent postnatal transmission. Alternatively, they can use formula or donor breast milk that has been screened for HIV.\n\n4. **HIV testing and counseling**: Pregnant women should be tested for HIV, and those who are positive should receive counseling and support.\n\n5. **Antiretroviral prophylaxis for the baby**: Administering ART to the baby after birth can reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n6. **PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) programs**: Implementing comprehensive PMTCT programs, which include ART, safe delivery practices, and postnatal care, can effectively reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission.\n\nThese measures, when implemented effectively, can significantly reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "To prevent perinatal transmission of HIV, pregnant women should take antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy and childbirth. ART throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduces the chances of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1%."

    "question": "What are the main cell types infected with HIV?",
    "answer": "The main cell types infected with HIV are CD4+ T cells, also known as T helper cells. These cells play a crucial role in the immune system, helping to activate and coordinate the immune response. Macrophages and dendritic cells can also be infected with HIV, but CD4+ T cells are the primary target.",
    "true_answer": "The main cell types found to be infected with HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophage-lineage cells."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?",
    "answer": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) are related but distinct concepts.\n\nHIV is a viral infection that attacks the body's immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells). If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS.\n\nAIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by severe damage to the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count falls below 200 cells per cubic milliliter of blood.\n\nIn other words, HIV is the virus itself, while AIDS is the condition that develops as a result of the virus's progression.",
    "true_answer": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the most advanced stage of HIV infection."

    "question": "How is HIV not transmitted?",
    "answer": "HIV is not transmitted through:\n\n1. **Casual contact**: Hugging, shaking hands, sharing food or drinks, or using the same toilet.\n2. **Airborne transmission**: HIV is not spread through coughing, sneezing, or breathing the same air.\n3. **Mosquito bites**: Mosquitoes do not transmit HIV.\n4. **Insect vectors**: Insects like ticks, fleas, or lice do not transmit HIV.\n5. **Swimming pools or hot tubs**: Water does not transmit HIV.\n6. **Inanimate objects**: HIV is not transmitted through contact with surfaces, doorknobs, or other non-human objects.\n\nHowever, HIV can be transmitted through:\n\n1. **Unprotected sex**: Without a condom or other barrier method.\n2. **Sharing needles or syringes**: Injecting drugs or medical equipment without proper sterilization.\n3. **Mother-to-child transmission**: During pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding if the mother is not on treatment or has a high viral load.\n4. **Blood transfusions**: Receiving blood from an infected donor, but this is rare in countries with proper screening.\n\nRemember, prevention is key. Practicing safe sex, using clean needles, and getting tested regularly can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",
    "true_answer": "You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV. Casual contact with a person who has HIV, such as a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. Contact with objects, such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. Mosquitoes, ticks, or other biting insects. Other sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching). HIV can\u2019t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin."

    "question": "What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?",
    "answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is a complex process. \n\nLatent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates into the host's DNA, and the immune system suppresses the virus. This can happen when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated or when the immune system is able to control the virus naturally.\n\nThe switch to active infection can occur due to various factors, including:\n\n1.  **Discontinuation of ART**: Stopping ART can lead to the reactivation of the virus, as the immune system is no longer able to suppress it.\n2.  **Immunosuppression**: Conditions like HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), cancer, or organ transplantation can weaken the immune system, allowing the virus to become active.\n3.  **Immune system dysregulation**: Certain autoimmune disorders or inflammatory conditions can disrupt the balance of the immune system, leading to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n4.  **Viral mutations**: Genetic mutations in the virus can make it more resistant to the host's immune response, leading to the reactivation of latent HIV.\n5.  **Re-exposure to HIV**: In rare cases, re-exposure to HIV through sexual contact or other means can reactivate latent infection.\n\nThe switch from latent to active infection can be unpredictable, and it's essential for individuals to maintain consistent ART adherence and work closely with their healthcare provider to monitor their viral load and immune status.",
    "true_answer": "The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell . One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV."
