    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and lumbar puncture results, it appears she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nHowever, I must correct the previous treatment with Chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol is not the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that can be used for bacterial infections, but it's not effective against fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn the acute setting, it would be beneficial to consider the following:\n\n1.  Imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI of the head) to evaluate for any complications such as hydrocephalus or brain herniation.\n2.  Repeat lumbar puncture in 24-48 hours to assess for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sterilization and to monitor for any signs of improvement.\n3.  Consider initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve the patient's immune function and reduce the risk of future opportunistic infections.\n4.  Close monitoring for potential side effects of amphotericin B, such as renal toxicity.\n\nIt's essential to consult with an infectious disease specialist for further guidance on managing this patient's treatment.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to consider the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who tested negative) and the total number of patients without AIDS.\n\nThe number of patients without AIDS who tested negative is 250 - 5 = 245 (since 5 tested positive).\n\nThe total number of patients without AIDS is also 250.\n\nThe NPV is calculated as: True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives). However, in this case, since we're looking at the specificity of the test in the control arm, we need to calculate the NPV in the context of the test's ability to exclude AIDS in those without the disease.\n\nBut to answer your question based on the information given and to calculate the NPV, we need to calculate the true negatives and false positives in the AIDS group. \n\nThe true negatives in the AIDS group are 250 - 240 = 10 (since 240 tested positive).\n\nThe NPV is calculated as: True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives). \n\nSo, NPV = 10 / (10 + 0) = 1 (or 100%) because all patients without AIDS in the study were correctly identified by the novel screening examination.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5)\" seems to be a reference to the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or sensitivity of the test, not the NPV.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation with sudden onset of weakness, fever, and a history of inconsistent adherence to his HIV medications, I would recommend immediate HIV viral load and CD4 count testing to assess for potential HIV treatment failure or resistance. This is crucial before starting or adjusting antifungal treatment.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years is not standard practice. Typically, antifungal therapy is guided by culture and sensitivity results. Itraconazole is often used for specific fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, but not empirically for 10 years.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of weakness and fever could be related to a variety of causes, including HIV-related opportunistic infections or complications from his comorbid conditions. A thorough evaluation, including imaging studies and possibly a lumbar puncture, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD).\n\nThe patient's symptoms of progressive cognitive decline, including memory loss, difficulty with daily activities, and personality changes, are consistent with HAD. The MRI findings of disseminated non-enhancing white matter lesions are also consistent with HIV-related brain injury.\n\nThe patient's low CD4 count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (>100,000 copies/mL) suggest that his HIV is not well-controlled, which is a contributing factor to the development of HAD.\n\nVascular dementia is less likely, as there are no focal neurological deficits and no evidence of vascular disease on the MRI.\n\nToxoplasma gondii IgG positivity is a common finding in HIV-infected individuals, but it is not a direct cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.\n\nIt's worth noting that the diagnosis of HAND should be confirmed by a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, but the clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest that HAD is the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "Given this patient's history and current presentation, the following tests should be considered at this visit:\n\n1. Confirmatory HIV test (repeat HIV testing at 8 weeks gestation is recommended due to the window period between the initial test and the current gestational age).\n2. Urine pregnancy test (already confirmed, but re-checking is standard practice).\n3. Blood type and Rh factor.\n4. Rubella serology (to assess immunity to rubella and provide a basis for future vaccination recommendations).\n5. Syphilis screening (RPR or VDRL) - given the patient's history of sexual activity, it's essential to check for syphilis.\n6. Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening (culture or rapid antigen test) - typically performed between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation, but it's reasonable to start the process now by sending a culture.\n7. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test - to assess for hepatitis B status.\n8. Glucose screening (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) - typically performed between 24-28 weeks of gestation, but can be started now.\n9. Fetal ultrasound to confirm gestational age and rule out any gross fetal anomalies.\n\nPlease note that some of these tests might be part of the hospital's standard prenatal protocol, and it's essential to confirm with your hospital's policies and guidelines.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "I can't recommend specific medications for the patient. However, I can provide general guidance.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4 count (33 cells/mm3), he is likely at high risk for opportunistic infections. \n\n1.  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is recommended with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or Dapsone/Trimethoprim. \n2.  To prevent Toxoplasmosis, the patient may be prescribed Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine.\n3.  For Cryptococcal meningitis prophylaxis, Fluconazole can be used, but this is not the only option. Other options include Amphotericin B or other antifungals.\n\nConsult with an infectious disease specialist to determine the most suitable prophylaxis for this patient.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of fever, skin lesions, and low CD4 count, combined with the biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, I suspect Bacillary angiomatosis (BA), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, typically seen in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of intravenous drug use and the presence of track marks, it's also possible that she has a concurrent infection such as endocarditis or osteomyelitis, but the skin lesions and biopsy findings are more suggestive of BA.\n\nThe standard treatment for Bacillary angiomatosis is Erythromycin or Azithromycin, but given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and potential for endocarditis or osteomyelitis, we need to cover for possible co-infections.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend a combination of Erythromycin 500mg PO BID for 4-6 weeks, plus a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q24h for 2-4 weeks to cover for possible co-infections. \n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years makes me hesitant to use Sulfonamide-based antibiotics, as it may increase the risk of severe hematologic toxicity.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's treatment regimen, which includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for:\n\n1. **Pancreatitis**: This is a known adverse effect of indinavir, which has already been mentioned as a concern. Pancreatitis can be severe and potentially life-threatening.\n\n2. **Nephrolithiasis**: Indinavir can cause kidney stones due to its crystalluria.\n\n3. **Hepatotoxicity**: Although less common with the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine, indinavir can also cause liver enzyme elevations.\n\n4. **Diarrhea**: Indinavir can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, which may be more pronounced in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal issues.\n\n5. **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Indinavir can increase triglyceride levels, which may contribute to pancreatitis risk.\n\n6. **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Indinavir can cause skin rash and other hypersensitivity reactions in some patients.\n\nIt's essential to closely monitor the patient for these potential adverse effects and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient's presentation of headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, apathy, and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, along with the patient's history of HIV, suggests a diagnosis of Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL). \n\nThe patient's low CD4 count (90/\u03bcL) and history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy may have contributed to his immunocompromised state, increasing his risk for PCNSL. The presence of Epstein-Blastoma is not the correct diagnosis here as the PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA, which is a common finding in Primary CNS Lymphoma, especially in immunocompromised patients with HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."
