    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is likely. In addition to amphotericin B and flucytosine, it is crucial to consider the following:\n\n1. **Flucytosine levels**: Monitor flucytosine levels to ensure they remain within the therapeutic range (50-100 mg/L) to prevent resistance.\n2. **Lumbar puncture repeat**: Repeat the lumbar puncture after 24-48 hours to assess for a decrease in opening pressure and improvement in CSF parameters.\n3. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART) intensification**: Consider intensifying the patient's ART regimen, as HIV suppression is essential for preventing further immune system decline and improving outcomes.\n4. **Supportive care**: Provide supportive care, including fluid replacement, pain management, and nutritional support, as the patient may be experiencing dehydration and malnutrition due to her underlying condition.\n5. **Consider fluconazole**: Some guidelines recommend adding fluconazole (400-800 mg PO daily) to the treatment regimen for cryptococcal meningitis, particularly if the patient is not responding to amphotericin B and flucytosine. However, the decision to add fluconazole should be made on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's low CD4 count (47) and severe immunocompromised state make her susceptible to opportunistic infections. Close monitoring and aggressive management are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of patients without AIDS who tested negative on the novel screening examination. \n\nNumber of patients without AIDS: 250\nNumber of patients without AIDS who tested positive: 5\nNumber of patients without AIDS who tested negative: 250 - 5 = 245\n\nNumber of patients with AIDS: 250\nNumber of patients with AIDS who tested positive: 240\n\nThe formula for NPV is: (True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)) \nHowever, to calculate the False Negatives, we need the total number of patients with AIDS who tested negative on the novel screening examination, which is not provided.\n\nTo calculate the False Negatives, we can use the following formula:\nTrue Positives / Sensitivity = 240 / (240 + False Negatives)\n240 / (240 + x) = 240 / 250 (Sensitivity is 96% in this case, as 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive)\nx = 10\nNumber of patients with AIDS who tested negative: 10\n\nNow we can calculate the NPV:\nTrue Negatives = 245\nFalse Negatives = 10\nNPV = (True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)) = (245 / (245 + 10)) = 0.961",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness in one extremity, fever, and a history of inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART), the next best step in management is to investigate for potential opportunistic infections and complications related to HIV, particularly in the context of immunocompromised status.\n\nI would order a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or cryptococcal meningitis, which are more common in patients with advanced HIV. \n\nAdditionally, I would also order a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and liver function tests (LFTs) to assess for potential infections, inflammation, or medication side effects.\n\nIt is also crucial to re-evaluate the patient's adherence to his ART regimen and consider adjusting or intensifying his antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that before proceeding with an LP, the patient's fever and potential increased intracranial pressure should be addressed.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD). \n\nThe patient's history of cognitive decline (forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks), motor symptoms (right lower extremity weakness, unsteady gait), and psychiatric symptoms (paranoia, agitation, restlessness) in the context of advanced HIV disease (low CD4 count and high viral load) and previous non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, non-enhancing white matter lesions are consistent with HIV-related white matter disease, which is a common cause of HAND. The absence of mass effect and the patient's overall clinical presentation make other diagnoses, such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis, less likely.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's low CD4 count and high viral load indicate a need for immediate initiation of ART to improve his immune function and manage his HIV.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's severely low CD4 count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. I would recommend the following additional medications:\n\n1.  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or dapsone for PCP prophylaxis to prevent this life-threatening opportunistic infection.\n2.  Prophylaxis for Toxoplasma gondii: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine can be used for Toxoplasma gondii prophylaxis, but this may be contraindicated due to the patient's CD4 count and potential for side effects.\n3.  Prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): Azithromycin or clarithromycin with ethambutol may be considered for MAC prophylaxis, but the effectiveness may be limited at this low CD4 count.\n4.  Prophylaxis for fungal infections: Fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis and histoplasmosis prophylaxis may be considered, but this is not a standard recommendation at this time.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient should also receive a thorough evaluation for potential opportunistic infections, such as bacterial pneumonia, and be closely monitored for signs of disease progression.\n\nAdditionally, addressing the patient's depression and adherence issues is crucial to ensure successful management of his HIV disease. Consider referring the patient to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.",
