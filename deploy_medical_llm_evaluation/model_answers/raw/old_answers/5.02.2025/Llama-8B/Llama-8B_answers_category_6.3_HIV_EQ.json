    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis (elevated opening pressure, lymphocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose), the current treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nHowever, I would like to clarify that chloramphenicol is not typically used for treating cryptococcal meningitis. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that is usually reserved for specific bacterial infections, not fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn this patient, given the severity of her symptoms and the high ICP, additional treatment in the acute setting may include:\n\n1. Dexamethasone: to reduce inflammation and ICP.\n2. Consideration of lumbar drain placement to help lower ICP.\n3. Monitoring of ICP and neurologic status closely.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's CD4 count of 47 indicates severe immunocompromise, and it's crucial to address the underlying HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to consider the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and the number of false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nWe have the following information:\n\n- True positives (AIDS patients testing positive): 240\n- False positives (non-AIDS patients testing positive): 5\n- Total patients without AIDS: 250\n\nHowever, we don't have the number of non-AIDS patients who tested negative. To find the NPV, we need this information.\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = (True negatives) / (True negatives + False negatives)\n\nUnfortunately, we can't calculate the NPV directly from the given data. We would need the number of non-AIDS patients who tested negative to proceed with the calculation.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset weakness, fever, and a history of inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART), I would recommend the following next steps:\n\n1. **Stabilize the patient**: Administer oxygen and consider empiric treatment for possible sepsis, given his fever and tachycardia.\n2. **Re-evaluate his ART regimen**: Given his low CD4 count and history of inconsistent adherence, I would strongly consider switching to a more potent and tolerable ART regimen. Raltegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine are a good backbone, but we should consider adding a boosted protease inhibitor (e.g., darunavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir) to improve virologic suppression.\n3. **Investigate the cause of the weakness**: Perform an MRI or an EMG to rule out conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by HIV or its treatment. \n4. **Discontinue itraconazole**: Our empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years is not standard practice and may be contributing to antifungal resistance. We should consider switching to a more targeted antifungal agent, such as voriconazole or posaconazole, if fungal infection is suspected.\n\nIt is also essential to assess the patient's adherence to his current medications and provide counseling on the importance of adherence to his ART regimen to prevent further immune suppression.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD) or AIDS dementia complex. The patient's symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, difficulty with daily activities, and right lower extremity weakness, are consistent with HAND. The patient's low CD4 count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) also support this diagnosis. \n\nThe presence of disseminated white matter lesions on MRI without mass effect is consistent with HIV-associated leukoencephalopathy, a common manifestation of HAND. Vascular dementia is less likely given the lack of focal neurological deficits and the presence of diffuse white matter lesions. The Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result does not necessarily indicate an active infection, as it can indicate past exposure. The patient's lymphadenopathy could be due to HIV-associated lymphadenopathy.\n\nIt's essential to note that the diagnosis of HAND requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including a thorough medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging studies.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "For this patient, given her low risk profile and no previous testing, I would recommend the following tests at this visit:\n\n1. **HIV antibody test**: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, it's essential to confirm HIV status again, as the window period for HIV testing can be up to 3 months.\n2. **Syphilis screening (RPR or VDRL)**: Given the patient's low risk, but still possible exposure, a syphilis screen is warranted.\n3. **Urinalysis**: To check for any potential urinary tract infections or other abnormalities.\n4. **Blood glucose and lipid profile**: To assess her baseline metabolic health during pregnancy.\n5. **Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening**: This is recommended for all pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation, but it can be done earlier if the patient has a history of GBS colonization or other risk factors. Since this patient is at 8 weeks, I would recommend testing for GBS at a later date.\n6. **Cervical Pap smear**: Although not strictly necessary at 8 weeks, it's recommended to perform a Pap smear between 21 and 29 weeks of gestation. However, if the patient has no history of abnormal Pap smears or cervical dysplasia, it can be deferred until later in pregnancy.\n\nNo additional tests are required at this time, as the patient has already had negative tests for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HSV-2, and she is up-to-date on vaccinations.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "I can't advise you on the specific medication this patient should take. However, I can provide general information. \n\nConsidering the patient's low CD4+ count and history of non-adherence, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. The most common opportunistic infections in someone with a low CD4+ count are Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), Toxoplasma encephalitis, and cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nIn addition to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the patient may require prophylaxis for PCP. \n\nA common medication for PCP prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend TMP-SMX as the first-line prophylaxis for PCP.\n\nFluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, not as a first-line prophylaxis for PCP.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of fever, skin lesions, and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 98/mm3, it's likely she has an opportunistic infection. The presence of white patches on her palate that can be scraped off, along with the biopsy results showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, is highly suggestive of cutaneous leishmaniasis, likely caused by Leishmania braziliensis or Leishmania mexicana, which are common in regions where this patient may have traveled or been exposed to.\n\nHowever, given the patient's HIV status, the more likely diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar), which is a systemic infection that can cause fever, weight loss, and other symptoms. The skin lesions are a secondary manifestation of the systemic infection.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status and the use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine in the hospital, which are not effective against Leishmania, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be Liposomal amphotericin B. This is the first-line treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, especially in HIV-infected patients.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Based on the treatment prescribed, lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, the patient is at greatest risk for pancreatitis. \n\nIndinavir is a protease inhibitor that can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including pancreatitis. This is a well-documented adverse effect of this medication. The patient's recent history of pancreatitis as an adverse effect from a previous treatment makes them more susceptible to this side effect.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and the MRI findings, I would consider the following differential diagnoses:\n\n1. Primary CNS lymphoma: Given the patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the CSF, primary CNS lymphoma is a strong consideration.\n2. Toxoplasmosis: Although the patient is taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is effective against toxoplasmosis, the presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion and the patient's symptoms could suggest this diagnosis.\n3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): However, PML typically presents with multiple white matter lesions, not a solitary ring-enhancing lesion.\n\nGiven the patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy and the current low CD4 count, the most likely diagnosis is Primary CNS lymphoma. The fact that the patient had a similar case of Glioblastoma is not directly relevant to this case, as Glioblastoma is a different type of brain tumor that typically occurs in immunocompetent individuals.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step in management of this infant would be to administer zidovudine (AZT) to the newborn for 6 weeks, starting within 12 hours of birth. This is a standard practice for infants born to HIV-positive mothers, regardless of the maternal viral load or the specific antiretroviral therapy used during pregnancy. This regimen is often referred to as the \"4-in-1\" or \"4-drug\" regimen, which includes zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, and nelfinavir.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
