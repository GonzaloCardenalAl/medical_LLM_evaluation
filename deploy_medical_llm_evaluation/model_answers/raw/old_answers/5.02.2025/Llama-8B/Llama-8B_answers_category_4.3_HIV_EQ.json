    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, it appears she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. \n\nIn addition to IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, I would recommend starting:\n\n1. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: Immediately initiate ART to boost the patient's immune system and help control HIV replication. This is crucial for the management of AIDS and prevention of opportunistic infections.\n2. **Lumbar puncture follow-up**: Schedule a follow-up lumbar puncture in 2-3 days to monitor CSF pressure and glucose levels, and adjust treatment as necessary.\n3. **Supportive care**: Manage the patient's symptoms, such as pain, fever, and fatigue, with medications like acetaminophen, antipyretics, and anti-emetics as needed.\n4. **Close monitoring**: Closely monitor the patient's vital signs, renal function, and electrolyte levels, as amphotericin B can cause nephrotoxicity.\n\nThe initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel screening examination, we need to consider the following:\n\n- True negatives (TN): 250 (patients without AIDS) - 5 (false positives) = 245\n- False positives: 5\n- True positives: 240\n\nThe NPV is calculated as TN / (TN + false negatives). To find false negatives, we need the total number of patients with AIDS who tested negative on the novel screening examination. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 10 patients with AIDS must have tested negative (250 - 240 = 10).\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) \nNPV = 245 / 255 \nNPV \u2248 0.96 or 96%",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of acute onset weakness, particularly in a patient with a history of HIV and a low CD4 count, we should consider opportunistic infections as a potential cause. The patient's fever, which is elevated at 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), also supports this concern.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out central nervous system (CNS) infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nBefore performing the LP, it would be essential to check the patient's platelet count to ensure it is safe to perform the procedure, as patients with HIV are at risk for bleeding. Additionally, a CT scan of the head without contrast may be considered to rule out other causes of neurological symptoms, such as a stroke or abscess.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The patient's history of HIV noncompliance and low CD4 count (56/\u03bcL) suggest that his HIV is not well-controlled, which can lead to neurological complications.\n\nThe patient's neurological symptoms, such as right lower extremity weakness, unsteady gait, and cognitive decline (forgetfulness, confusion, difficulty with daily activities), are consistent with HAD. The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive result is not indicative of an active Toxoplasma infection, but rather a past exposure. The serum Cryptococcal antigen negative result rules out cryptococcal meningitis, which is another possible cause of neurological symptoms in HIV patients.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's low CD4 count and high viral load require immediate attention, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be restarted or adjusted to achieve viral suppression.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, he is likely experiencing severe immunosuppression, and opportunistic infections are a significant concern. \n\nIn addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), I would recommend initiating prophylaxis for:\n\n1.  Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or dapsone-trimethoprim.\n2.  Toxoplasmosis: Pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine, although this can be challenging due to the patient's low CD4+ count and potential side effects.\n3.  Cryptococcal meningitis: Fluconazole (for prevention) or amphotericin B and flucytosine (for treatment).\n4.  Tuberculosis (TB) screening: Given his low CD4+ count, the patient is at increased risk for TB. He should undergo a TB skin test (PPD) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA).\n5.  Vaccinations: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines should be up-to-date.\n\nIt's crucial to address the patient's depression and encourage him to seek mental health support. A mental health professional should be involved in his care to develop a treatment plan to manage his depression and improve adherence to his HIV medications.\n\nPlease note that the patient's current ART regimen should be evaluated and adjusted if necessary, as his low CD4+ count suggests potential treatment failure.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation, I would suspect a diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis (BA), a complication of HIV/AIDS caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, often associated with cat scratch disease in immunocompetent individuals but can also be seen in immunocompromised patients. The presence of white patches on her palate (oral hairy leukoplakia is more common, but the description is suggestive of other conditions like oral candidiasis) and the biopsy findings of vascular proliferation with small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain support this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosa is antibiotics. Given the patient's immunocompromised state, a combination of doxycycline and gentamicin would be a suitable choice. Doxycycline has been shown to be effective against Bartonella species, and gentamicin has synergistic effects when used in combination.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Based on the treatment regimen started, the patient is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1.  **Nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity**: Indinavir can cause kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) and liver damage (hepatotoxicity), especially when combined with other medications. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and kidney function will be necessary.\n\n2.  **Diarrhea**: Lamivudine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea. This is usually mild and temporary but can be severe in some cases.\n\n3.  **Nausea and vomiting**: Zidovudine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and vomiting.\n\n4.  **Fat redistribution**: Indinavir can cause a condition called lipodystrophy, which is a redistribution of body fat. This can lead to a loss of fat in certain areas of the body, such as the face and arms, and an accumulation of fat in other areas, such as the abdomen and back of the neck.\n\n5.  **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can cause an increase in bilirubin levels, which can lead to jaundice.\n\n6.  **Hepatic steatosis**: Indinavir can cause fatty liver disease, which can be a serious side effect.\n\n7.  **Pancreatitis**: Indinavir can cause pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nIt is essential to closely monitor the patient for these potential side effects and adjust the treatment regimen as needed.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) in the context of HIV. \n\nThe presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, slight pleocytosis, and positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid strongly suggest a lymphoma. The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy likely contributed to the development of PCNSL.",
