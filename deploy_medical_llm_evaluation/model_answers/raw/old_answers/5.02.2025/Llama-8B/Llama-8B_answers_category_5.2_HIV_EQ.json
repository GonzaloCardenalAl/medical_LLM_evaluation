    "question": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the SCORE2 risk estimate of 5% indicates a moderate risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the presence of HIV can modify the CVD risk.\n\nThe current guidelines suggest that HIV-infected individuals with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% or higher should receive statin therapy for primary prevention. Since the patients' risk is 5%, statin therapy is not typically recommended for primary prevention in this scenario.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider other factors such as the patients' HIV viral load, CD4 count, and the presence of other CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia). Consult the latest guidelines, such as those from the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) or the International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA), for more specific recommendations on managing CVD risk in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend discussing the patients' individual risk profiles with them and considering other treatments that may be beneficial for their HIV and CVD risk management.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended."

    "question": "It is late at night in the clinic and I still have two patients in the waiting room, one 34-year-old white woman and a 34-year-old white male. I only have time to attend one of them. Who should I attend?",
    "answer": "I can't advise who you should attend to first. I can provide some general guidance on how to prioritize. \n\nIn general, medical ethics dictate that you should prioritize patients based on the urgency of their condition and the potential for harm if they are not seen promptly. \n\nIn your scenario, without knowing the specific conditions of the two patients, it's difficult to make a recommendation. However, you could consider prioritizing the patient who presents with a life-threatening emergency, such as severe acute symptoms, severe pain, or signs of acute distress.",

    "question": "Do black people have higher HIV infection rates because of their ethnicity?",
    "answer": "No, HIV infection rates are not directly caused by ethnicity. However, people of African descent, including those of African, Afro-Caribbean, and African American backgrounds, are disproportionately affected by HIV due to various social, economic, and historical factors.\n\nThese factors include:\n\n1.  Higher prevalence of poverty and socioeconomic disadvantage, which can limit access to healthcare and education about HIV prevention.\n2.  Stigma and discrimination, which can prevent individuals from seeking testing and treatment.\n3.  Limited access to HIV prevention services, such as condoms and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n4.  Higher rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can increase the risk of HIV transmission.\n5.  Historical and ongoing systemic racism, which can contribute to these disparities.\n\nIt's essential to address these underlying factors to reduce the HIV epidemic in these communities.",
    "true_answer": "No, ethnicity is not considered a risk factor to get infected with HIV."

    "question": "In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty. I am a clinician located in Uganda. Should I consider HIV-positive patients homosexuals?",
    "answer": "In Uganda, the law and societal attitudes towards homosexuality can be complex and challenging. However, as a clinician, it's essential to maintain confidentiality and provide non-judgmental care to all patients, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn your practice, you should not ask about a patient's sexual orientation unless it's directly relevant to their medical care. Focus on providing evidence-based care and addressing their specific health needs.\n\nIf a patient is HIV-positive and their sexual orientation is not directly related to their HIV diagnosis or treatment, it's not necessary to consider it in their care. Your primary concern should be providing effective HIV management, adherence support, and addressing any other health issues they may have.\n\nIt's also essential to be aware of the local laws and regulations regarding confidentiality and patient rights. You may want to familiarize yourself with the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, which emphasizes the importance of confidentiality and non-discrimination in healthcare.",
    "true_answer": "No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population."

    "question": "32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi infection). The erythema migrans rash, which is a characteristic \"bullseye\" rash, is a classic symptom of Lyme disease, especially in the context of a hiking trip in an endemic area. The rash typically appears within 3-30 days after the tick bite, which fits with the patient's timeline.\n\nThe other symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle and joint aches, fever, palpitations, and dizziness, are also consistent with Lyme disease, particularly in its early disseminated stage. \n\nGiven the patient's history of unprotected anal receptive intercourse, it's also possible that he may be at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including syphilis, which can present with a rash and other systemic symptoms. However, the presence of the erythema migrans rash and the patient's recent exposure to ticks in an endemic area make Lyme disease the more likely diagnosis.\n\nIt would be essential to perform a physical examination, take a thorough medical history, and consider ordering diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease serology or PCR, to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 34-year-old HIV-positive pregnant woman presents for a check-up at week 36. The HIV viral load shows 190 copies/mL. Should I offer an alternative to natural birth?",
    "answer": "Given the viral load of 190 copies/mL, which is considered undetectable, the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is extremely low, typically <1%. However, I would recommend discussing the risks and benefits of different birth options with the patient, including vaginal delivery, cesarean section, or elective induction. \n\nIn general, for women with an undetectable viral load, vaginal delivery is considered a safe option, but a cesarean section might be considered if the patient has other risk factors for mother-to-child transmission, such as preterm labor or a history of previous cesarean section.",
    "true_answer": "An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery. For unscheduled cesarean delivery: consider administering loading dose then proceed to delivery."

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy. She is HLA-B*57:01 positive and CVD risk >10%. Should I treat her with ABC/3TC + DTG drug regimen?",
    "answer": "Given her HLA-B*57:01 status, I would advise against using abacavir (ABC) due to the risk of hypersensitivity reaction. The ABC/3TC + DTG regimen would not be suitable for this patient. \n\nA safer alternative could be a TAF-based regimen, such as TAF/3TC + DTG. However, we should also consider other factors, such as her CVD risk and potential interactions with other medications. It's essential to discuss the best treatment options with the patient and consider alternative regimens.",
    "true_answer": "No, the ABC/3TC + DTG treatment regimen can not be used in people with high cardiovascular risk and HLA-B*57:01 positive."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation. The blood test indicated HIV-VL > 50,000 copies/mL. Is it appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy?",
    "answer": "No, it's not appropriate to change the patient's regimen to XTC (likely referring to efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) + TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor) dual therapy for someone with a viral load (VL) > 50,000 copies/mL. \n\nCurrent guidelines recommend initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a combination of at least three drugs from different classes to achieve viral suppression. Dual therapy is generally not recommended, especially for someone with a high VL. This approach may not effectively suppress the virus and may lead to resistance.",
    "true_answer": "XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy."

    "question": "A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?",
    "answer": "Phenytoin is an enzyme inducer, specifically an inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. \n\nIn the context of this patient's ART regimen (TAF/FTC/BIC), Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, while Emtricitabine (FTC) is not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes. \n\nBictegravir (BIC) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. \n\nThe interaction between phenytoin and BIC is a concern because phenytoin can induce CYP3A4, potentially leading to decreased levels of BIC, which could result in reduced efficacy of the regimen. \n\nHowever, the impact of phenytoin on TAF and FTC levels is less clear. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's viral load and adjust the ART regimen if necessary, and also monitor for signs of reduced efficacy or toxicity of BIC.",
    "true_answer": "Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately."

    "question": "A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive. Is it appropriate to prescribe a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG?",
    "answer": "I can't provide a specific treatment regimen. However, I can explain the situation.\n\nGiven the patient is already on a PrEP regimen with tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, which contains tenofovir and emtricitabine, it would not be necessary to prescribe 3TC (lamivudine), as it's already part of their PrEP regimen.\n\nXTC is not a standard abbreviation for an HIV medication. You might be referring to FTC (emtricitabine), which is already part of their current regimen.\n\nDTG (dolutegravir) is a suitable option for treatment-naive individuals with HIV, but I would need more information about the patient's viral load, resistance testing, and other factors before recommending a treatment regimen.\n\nA more suitable approach would be to reassess the patient's treatment plan, consider switching to an HIV treatment regimen that includes dolutegravir, and monitor their response to treatment.",
    "true_answer": "XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen. Future steps have to be evaluated carefully by an HIV specialist clinician which would involve HIV genotypic resistance testing, assessing adherence of the patient and patient\u2019s partner to medication."
