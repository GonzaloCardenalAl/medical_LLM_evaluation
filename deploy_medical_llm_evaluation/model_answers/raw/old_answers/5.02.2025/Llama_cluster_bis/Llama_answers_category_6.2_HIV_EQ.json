    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lumbar puncture results are suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nRegarding the use of Chloramphenicol, it's not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, in the context of suspected or confirmed cryptococcal meningitis, the additional treatment that may be warranted in the acute setting is corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to manage increased intracranial pressure. \n\nIt's also crucial to monitor the patient's mental status, vision, and other neurological signs, as well as to consider repeated lumbar punctures to manage elevated intracranial pressure. \n\nIt's worth noting that Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that can be used to treat certain bacterial infections, but it's not typically used to treat fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis. The previous patient you treated with Chloramphenicol likely had a different diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nFrom the data:\n- True positives (TP) = 240\n- False positives (FP) = 5\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nFirst, calculate the false negatives (FN):\nTotal patients with AIDS = TP + FN\n250 = 240 + FN\nFN = 10\n\nNext, calculate the true negatives (TN):\nTotal patients without AIDS = TN + FP\n250 = TN + 5\nTN = 245\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is calculated as: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV = 245 / 255\nNPV = 0.9608 or approximately 96.08%\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.08%. This means that about 96.08% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, presentation of sudden weakness, and fever, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), is high. However, the focal neurological deficit (weakness in one extremity) also raises concern for a localized process like a stroke or an infectious or malignant mass lesion, particularly in the context of his immunocompromised state.\n\nThe next best step would be to urgently perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for these possibilities. Additionally, given the patient's fever and history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, it's crucial to assess his current HIV viral load and consider the possibility of an opportunistic infection. Blood cultures, a complete blood count, and metabolic panel should also be obtained.\n\nEmpiric treatment with itraconazole is not the immediate next step without further diagnostic clarification, as it is typically used for fungal infections, and its use should be guided by specific diagnostic findings or a strong clinical suspicion for a particular fungal infection. \n\nTherefore, the immediate management should focus on stabilizing the patient, conducting a thorough diagnostic workup including neuroimaging, and considering the initiation of broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage if an infectious etiology is suspected, pending further diagnostic results.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is not vascular dementia, but rather HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD). \n\nThe key factors supporting this diagnosis include:\n- The patient's low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, indicating poorly controlled HIV infection.\n- The presence of cognitive decline, including memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, and disorientation.\n- The neurological examination showing right lower extremity weakness and somnolence.\n- The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions, which are consistent with HIV encephalitis.\n\nWhile vascular dementia could be considered given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, the combination of the patient's immunocompromised state, high viral load, and specific neuroimaging findings point more strongly towards HIV-associated dementia as the primary diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to HIV medications, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for prophylaxis against fungal infections, specifically cryptococcosis and candidiasis, in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nIn addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), I would recommend the following medications:\n\n1. Fluconazole (as you mentioned) for fungal prophylaxis, particularly for cryptococcal disease prevention, typically when CD4+ count is below 100 cells/mm3.\n2. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is recommended when CD4+ count is below 200 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's essential to address the patient's depression, which likely contributed to his non-adherence. Referral to a mental health professional and support services to help manage his depression and improve medication adherence is crucial.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. \n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is azithromycin or doxycycline. However, considering the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count, it's essential to also consider the treatment of other potential opportunistic infections.\n\nThe hospital's use of Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine suggests a history of treating toxoplasmosis or other opportunistic infections, but this combination is not the first-line treatment for BA.\n\nI would recommend azithromycin as the initial treatment, considering its efficacy against Bartonella species and its relatively favorable side effect profile.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's treatment regimen includes lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, and considering one of these medications is known for a risk of pancreatitis, it's likely that the medication in question is lamivudine or zidovudine, as both are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that can have pancreatitis as a side effect, though it's more commonly associated with other NRTIs like didanosine or stavudine.\n\nHowever, the specific concern with the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is the risk of lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, rather than pancreatitis. \n\nIndinavir, a protease inhibitor, is more commonly associated with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and hyperbilirubinemia (elevated bilirubin levels) rather than pancreatitis.\n\nGiven the medications listed, the patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects such as lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly with steatosis (from lamivudine and zidovudine), nephrolithiasis, and hyperbilirubinemia (from indinavir).",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "While the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, such as a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, might suggest a tumor like glioblastoma, the key details here point towards a different diagnosis. The patient's history of HIV, particularly with a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (90/\u03bcL), and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, are critical. The ring-enhancing lesion in the context of immunocompromised status and the specific laboratory findings are more suggestive of a cerebral lymphoma, specifically primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is known to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus, especially in immunocompromised patients. This diagnosis is more likely than glioblastoma given the patient's immunocompromised state and the specific viral findings.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and viral load, the infant is at risk for HIV transmission. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant. \n\nAccording to current guidelines, the recommended regimen for infants born to HIV-positive mothers is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, not a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. The combination you mentioned is more typical of treatment regimens for infants with confirmed HIV infection, not prophylaxis. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start the infant on zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis, and arrange for HIV testing, including a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, to determine the infant's HIV status.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
