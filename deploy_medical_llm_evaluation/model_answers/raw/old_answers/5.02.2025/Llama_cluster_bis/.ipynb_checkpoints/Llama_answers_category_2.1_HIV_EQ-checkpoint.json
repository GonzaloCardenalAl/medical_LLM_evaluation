    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. Based on historical data, the following antiretroviral drugs were likely among the most frequently administered in Switzerland during that time:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was not yet widely available, so it's less likely, but possible\n5. It's difficult to determine a clear fifth option, as treatment options were limited. However, some patients may have received ribavirin or other experimental treatments, but these were not widely used.\n\nPlease note that the treatment landscape for HIV has evolved significantly since 1990, and these medications are no longer the primary treatment options. If you have any further questions or would like more information on current treatments, I'd be happy to help.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "According to available data, in 2010, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower compared to the general population. However, with the advancement of antiretroviral therapy, many women with HIV are now able to have healthy pregnancies. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting the Swiss Federal Statistical Office or relevant medical literature from that time period.",

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "A very specific question. While I'm not aware of a specific study that directly answers this question, I can provide some general insights.\n\nResearch suggests that the rate of CD4 decline can vary depending on several factors, including age at infection, viral load, and other health conditions. However, I couldn't find any studies that specifically analyzed the difference in CD4 decline rates between individuals in Switzerland, diagnosed between 1990-2010, with an initial CD4 count above 300, and tested before or after the age of 20.\n\nIt's possible that such data may exist in Swiss HIV cohort studies or registries, but I'm not aware of any published studies that provide a clear answer to this question. If you're interested in exploring this topic further, I recommend searching for studies published in reputable scientific journals or consulting with researchers who have access to Swiss HIV cohort data.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
