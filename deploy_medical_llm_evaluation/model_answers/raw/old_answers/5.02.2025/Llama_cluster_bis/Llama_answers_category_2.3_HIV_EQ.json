    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "In 1990, the antiretroviral treatment options were limited. Based on historical data, the following five antiretroviral drugs were likely among the most frequently administered in Switzerland at that time:\n\n1. Zidovudine (AZT)\n2. Didanosine (ddI)\n3. Zalcitabine (ddC)\n4. Stavudine (d4T) was not yet widely used, so possibly Ribavirin was used, although not as an antiretroviral monotherapy, it was sometimes used in combination.\n5. It's unlikely that a fifth antiretroviral was commonly used. However, some patients might have received Acyclovir, which has some activity against HIV, although it is primarily an antiviral for herpes viruses.\n\nPlease note that the treatment of HIV in 1990 was quite different from today, with monotherapy being the standard of care, and combination therapy (HAART) not yet widely adopted.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "I'm not aware of the specific data on the proportion of people living with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland who died from HIV-related causes and had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20. This information would typically be found in epidemiological studies or reports from health authorities in Switzerland, such as the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Without access to the most current and specific data, I cannot provide an accurate answer. If you're looking for detailed statistics, I recommend consulting the latest reports or research studies from relevant Swiss health authorities or academic publications.",

    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "To answer this question accurately, I would need to refer to specific epidemiological studies or data from Switzerland focusing on individuals with HIV diagnosed between 1990 and 2010, with an initial CD4 count above 300, and compare the progression to a CD4 count below 200 in those diagnosed before versus after the age of 20.\n\nWithout access to specific studies or data that directly address this question, I cannot provide a definitive answer. The progression of HIV can be influenced by various factors including, but not limited to, the viral load, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lifestyle factors, and the presence of co-infections or co-morbidities.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the introduction and evolution of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the period of 1990 to 2010 significantly impacted the management and progression of HIV. Earlier initiation of ART, which became more common and recommended over this period, can significantly slow the decline in CD4 count.\n\nFor accurate information, I recommend consulting specific research studies or databases that track HIV progression in Switzerland during the specified period, taking into account the age at diagnosis and initial CD4 count.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
