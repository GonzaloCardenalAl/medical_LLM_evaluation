    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and lumbar puncture results, it appears she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS. \n\nIn addition to the initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, the patient may also benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to manage increased intracranial pressure. \n\nSpecifically, acetazolamide or repeated lumbar punctures may be considered to manage elevated intracranial pressure. Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status and intracranial pressure is essential in the acute setting.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True negatives = 250 (controls) - 5 (false positives) = 245\n- False negatives = 250 (AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10\n\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\n= 245 / (245 + 10)\n= 245 / 255\n= 0.961 (or approximately 96.1%)\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that about 96.1% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a CNS (central nervous system) process such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering the focal neurological deficit, a stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) should be ruled out, especially given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI or a CT scan if an MRI is not readily available, to evaluate for any structural abnormalities, infections, or vascular events. Additionally, blood work including a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and a CD4 viral load should be sent. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current adherence to antiretroviral therapy and consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist and a neurologist for further guidance. Given the fever and potential for an infectious cause, empiric antibiotic coverage may be considered, but this should be tailored based on the suspected cause and in consultation with specialists.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). This condition is characterized by disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, which is consistent with the patient's imaging results. PML is a rare and often fatal viral disease caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection (low CD4+ count and high viral load, as seen in this patient). The patient's symptoms, including progressive weakness, cognitive decline, and changes in mental status, also support this diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to his HIV medications, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Antidepressant medication**: To address his depression, I would consider prescribing an antidepressant, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline or fluoxetine, which are commonly used in patients with HIV.\n\n2. **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis**: With a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, the patient is at high risk for PCP. I would recommend prescribing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as prophylaxis.\n\nIt's essential to also address the patient's mental health and adherence to his HIV medications. I would consider referring him to a mental health professional and providing support to improve his adherence to antiretroviral therapy.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the patient likely has bacillary angiomatosis (BA), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is characteristic of this infection.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is erythromycin (or another macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin) for at least 3 months. Doxycycline is also an alternative option. It's essential to note that the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count increase her risk for opportunistic infections, and antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to her specific needs. Additionally, addressing her substance use and malnutrition will be crucial in her overall management.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). However, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid and the ring-enhancing lesion are also consistent with a diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis, but the low CD4 count and the specific involvement of the corpus callosum make PCNSL more likely in this context. \n\nIt would be crucial to perform further diagnostic tests, such as a brain biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis, as treatment and prognosis differ significantly between these two conditions.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."
