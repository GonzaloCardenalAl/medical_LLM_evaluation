    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and lumbar puncture results are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nThe use of Chloramphenicol in the previous patient is not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that is not typically used for fungal infections.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms, particularly if there is increased intracranial pressure. However, this should be done with caution and ideally in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen should be optimized as soon as possible to improve their immune status and prevent further opportunistic infections.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nTrue negatives are the patients without AIDS who tested negative, which is 250 - 5 = 245.\nFalse negatives are the patients with AIDS who tested negative, which is 250 - 240 = 10.\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 or 96.1%.\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, presentation with focal neurological deficits (weakness of one hand), and fever, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection, particularly cerebral toxoplasmosis or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering other possibilities like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or cryptococcal meningitis, among others.\n\nThe next best step would be to perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for focal lesions or other abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms. Additionally, considering the patient's fever and history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, it would be crucial to assess his current HIV viral load and CD4 count to understand the status of his HIV infection.\n\nEmpiric treatment with itraconazole is not the immediate next step without further diagnostic evaluation, as itraconazole is typically used for fungal infections, and the clinical presentation suggests the need for a broader diagnostic approach initially. \n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's temperature suggests an infectious or inflammatory process, which needs to be addressed. Blood cultures, CBC, and other relevant labs should be considered to evaluate for systemic infection or other complications.\n\nGiven the complexity of this case, consultation with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist would be beneficial.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is not Vascular dementia, but rather HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) or possibly Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), given the disseminated white matter lesions on MRI. However, the presence of non-enhancing lesions and the clinical presentation also suggest the possibility of HIV-associated dementia or other opportunistic infections. The patient's low CD4 count, high viral load, and history of non-compliance with medications increase the risk for opportunistic infections and neurological complications. Further evaluation and testing, such as lumbar puncture and JC virus PCR, may be necessary to rule out PML and other conditions.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for prophylaxis against fungal infections, specifically to prevent cryptococcal disease and esophageal candidiasis, in patients with CD4+ counts below 100 cells/mm3, but particularly below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIn addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to manage his HIV infection, this patient should also be considered for:\n\n1. **Fluconazole** for primary prophylaxis against cryptococcal disease if his CD4+ count is below 100 cells/mm3, and especially given his current low count.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is recommended for patients with a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3.\n3. **Azithromycin** or other prophylaxis may be considered for prevention of other opportunistic infections, depending on the specific clinical scenario and local guidelines.\n\nIt's also crucial to address the patient's depression, as it likely contributed to his non-adherence to HIV medication. Referral to mental health services or initiation of antidepressant therapy, if appropriate, should be considered to support his overall health and adherence to treatment.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and biopsy results showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, the diagnosis is likely Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA). BA is caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana, and it's common in immunocompromised patients, especially those with advanced HIV.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is Azithromycin or Doxycycline. However, since your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years, it's likely that they are being used as an alternative treatment for toxoplasmosis or other opportunistic infections, but not as a first-line treatment for BA.\n\nI would recommend using Azithromycin as the first-line treatment for this patient. If Azithromycin is not available, Doxycycline or Erythromycin can be used as alternatives. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are not the preferred treatment for BA.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for pancreatitis due to the use of lamivudine and zidovudine, but more so with other NRTIs like didanosine and stavudine, but also lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, which are associated with NRTIs, particularly in the context of mitochondrial toxicity. However, since you specifically mentioned pancreatitis, I would like to know which medication you recently prescribed to assess the risk more accurately.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, and the low CD4 count, the most likely diagnosis is not Glioblastoma, but rather a condition more commonly associated with immunocompromised patients, such as Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in immunocompromised individuals, and the presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are more consistent with PCNSL than with Glioblastoma, especially in the context of the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. \n\nThe recommended regimen typically includes zidovudine (AZT) for the newborn, which is usually started as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 6 hours. The exact regimen may vary depending on current guidelines and the specific clinical context, but zidovudine monotherapy for a period of 4-6 weeks is commonly recommended for infants born to mothers with HIV who have received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy.\n\nIt's also important to note that the infant should undergo HIV testing, including virologic tests such as HIV PCR, at birth (or as soon as possible), at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age to determine HIV status. \n\nThe combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine you mentioned might be considered in certain cases, but for the newborn, the initial approach typically involves zidovudine monotherapy as prophylaxis, with adjustments based on further clinical evaluation and guidelines.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
