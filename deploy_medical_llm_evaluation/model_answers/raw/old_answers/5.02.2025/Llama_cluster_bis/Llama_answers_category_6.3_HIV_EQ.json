    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in individuals with AIDS. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nThe use of chloramphenicol in the previous patient is not a standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, and it's possible that it was an error or used for a different condition.\n\nIn the acute setting, an additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of acetazolamide to reduce intracranial pressure, as the opening pressure is significantly elevated (285 mm H2O). Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and repeat lumbar punctures may also be necessary to manage elevated intracranial pressure. Corticosteroids are not typically used in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, unless there is evidence of IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome).",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5) based on past cases. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and the number of false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True positives (patients with AIDS who test positive) = 240\n- False positives (patients without AIDS who test positive) = 5\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250\n\nFirst, calculate the number of false negatives:\nFalse negatives = Total patients with AIDS - True positives = 250 - 240 = 10\n\nNext, calculate the number of true negatives:\nTrue negatives = Total patients without AIDS - False positives = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the proportion of patients with a negative test result who are truly free of the disease:\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 (or 96.1%)\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that about 96.1% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, presentation of sudden weakness, and fever, the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection, such as cryptococcal meningitis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), is high. However, the focal neurological deficit (3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity) suggests a localized process, which could be consistent with a condition like toxoplasmosis or a CNS lymphoma, but also could indicate a stroke.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to urgently perform neuroimaging, preferably an MRI of the brain, to evaluate for these possibilities, including stroke, toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, or other opportunistic infections. Additionally, given the patient's fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures, and possibly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated by the imaging findings) should be considered. Empiric treatment with itraconazole is not the immediate next step without further diagnostic clarification, as it is more specific for certain fungal infections and the patient's presentation suggests a need for broader diagnostic evaluation first. \n\nIt's also crucial to assess and improve the patient's adherence to his antiretroviral therapy (ART) to help boost his immune system, but this is secondary to addressing the acute neurological issue.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "I must correct the assumption that this is most frequently diagnosed as Vascular dementia based on past cases. The presentation of this patient, particularly with a history of HIV, low CD4+ count, high viral load, and the specific findings on the MRI, suggests a different diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status, low CD4+ count, and the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD) or a related condition such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) could be considered but the lack of mass effect and specific mention of nonenhancing lesions makes PML less likely. However, the clinical presentation and laboratory findings are more consistent with HIV-associated dementia. \n\nIt's crucial to note that vascular dementia typically presents with a step-wise decline in cognitive function, often associated with focal neurological signs and symptoms due to vascular events, which doesn't perfectly align with this patient's presentation. The patient's symptoms of progressive cognitive decline, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and the specific neuroimaging findings in the context of advanced HIV disease point more towards a diagnosis related to his HIV status rather than vascular dementia.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "At this visit, the following tests should be done:\n\n1. **Confirmatory urine pregnancy test** (if not already done)\n2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)** to check for anemia\n3. **Blood type and Rh factor**\n4. **Rubella immunity**\n5. **Hepatitis B surface antigen**\n6. **Syphilis screening** (RPR or VDRL)\n7. **HIV screening** (since her last test was 4 years ago)\n8. **Urinalysis** to check for protein, glucose, and infection\n9. **Pap smear** if due (depending on previous Pap smear results and guidelines)\n\nThe tests your hospital has been doing (Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2) may not be universally recommended for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit. \n\n- **TSH** is recommended for women with a history of thyroid disease or symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease.\n- **CMV serology** is not routinely recommended for pregnant women.\n- **PCR for HSV-2** is not a routine test for pregnant women without symptoms or a history of genital herpes.\n\nThese tests should be individualized based on the patient's risk factors, symptoms, and medical history.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3) and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is often prescribed for prophylaxis against fungal infections, specifically cryptococcosis and candidiasis, in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nIn addition to resuming his anti-retroviral therapy, I would recommend the following medications:\n\n1. Fluconazole (as you mentioned) for fungal prophylaxis, specifically to prevent cryptococcal disease and esophageal candidiasis.\n2. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).\n3. Consideration for other opportunistic infection prophylaxis may be necessary, depending on the patient's specific risk factors and clinical presentation.\n\nIt's also essential to address the patient's depression, as it has impacted his adherence to HIV medication. Referral to a mental health professional and support services to help with medication adherence would be beneficial.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. \n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is azithromycin or doxycycline. However, given the hospital's experience with Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, an alternative option could be considered, but typically, the first-line treatment would be azithromycin or doxycycline. \n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's HIV infection is not well-controlled, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as possible.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for pancreatitis due to the use of lamivudine and zidovudine, but more specifically, the risk of pancreatitis is more commonly associated with didanosine and stavudine, not the current medications. However, among the medications listed, zidovudine has been associated with a risk of bone marrow suppression, and lamivudine has been associated with a risk of lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, but a more common concern with the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is the risk of lipoatrophy (fat loss under the skin). Indinavir has been associated with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and hyperbilirubinemia.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation and diagnostic findings, particularly the ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI and the low CD4 count, are more suggestive of an opportunistic infection rather than a primary brain tumor like glioblastoma. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, along with the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV, points towards a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a known complication in individuals with advanced HIV infection and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus. The recent adherence to antiretroviral therapy may not have been sufficient to significantly improve the patient's immune status, given the short duration. Therefore, PCNSL is a more likely diagnosis than glioblastoma in this context.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and viral load, the infant is at risk for HIV transmission. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn. \n\nAccording to current guidelines, the recommended regimen for newborns born to HIV-positive mothers is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, not a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. This is because the risk of HIV transmission to the infant is reduced with the mother's viral load being relatively low and her receipt of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. \n\nAdditionally, HIV PCR testing should be performed on the infant at birth, 2 weeks, and 4-6 weeks of age, and at 12-18 months to determine the infant's HIV status.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
