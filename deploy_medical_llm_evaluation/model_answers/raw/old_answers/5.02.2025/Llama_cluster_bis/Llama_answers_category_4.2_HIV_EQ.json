    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment initiated with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is appropriate.\n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment that may be warranted is the administration of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and cerebral edema, which can occur when treating cryptococcal meningitis, especially in patients with very low CD4 counts. However, the primary concern in the acute management is to also consider therapeutic interventions to manage elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which can be life-threatening. This may include repeated lumbar punctures to relieve pressure, as indicated by the high opening pressure of 285 mm H2O. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and ICP is crucial.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without AIDS who test negative) and the number of false negatives (patients with AIDS who test negative).\n\nFrom the data:\n- True negatives = 250 (controls without AIDS) - 5 (controls with false positive result) = 245\n- False negatives = 250 (patients with AIDS) - 240 (patients with AIDS who tested positive) = 10\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 (or 96.1%)\n\nSo, the Negative Predictive Value of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that if the test result is negative, there is a 96.1% probability that the patient does not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a neurological complication related to HIV, such as toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering the acute presentation, an infectious or inflammatory cause such as meningitis or encephalitis, or even a stroke, given the family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately order imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for any focal lesions, infarcts, or other abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms. Additionally, given the fever and the patient's immunocompromised state, blood cultures, a complete blood count (CBC), and other relevant labs should be drawn to evaluate for any signs of infection. Lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis should also be considered, pending the results of the imaging and clinical evaluation, to assess for meningitis or encephalitis. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current viral load and consider the possibility of an IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome) if the patient has recently started or changed antiretroviral therapy. \n\nGiven the complexity of the case, consultation with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist would be beneficial.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, along with the physical findings of right leg weakness and the laboratory results showing a very low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically a severe form known as HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on the MRI are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's non-adherence to HIV medication and resulting high viral load and low CD4+ count increase the likelihood of opportunistic infections and neurological complications, but the described symptoms and imaging findings are more indicative of direct HIV effects on the brain rather than an opportunistic infection like toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis, which are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen and the lack of mass effect on the MRI.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to his HIV medications, it's essential to address both issues. For depression, I would recommend starting an antidepressant, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline or fluoxetine, which are commonly used in patients with HIV.\n\nAdditionally, considering his low CD4+ count, I would also recommend prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and toxoplasmosis with TMP-SMX, as well as consideration for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis with azithromycin if his CD4+ count remains below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nIt's crucial to also re-initiate and optimize his antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, and provide counseling and support to improve adherence.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana. \n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for BA is azithromycin or doxycycline. Azithromycin is often preferred due to its efficacy, convenience, and tolerability. The typical treatment duration is at least 3 months to prevent relapse. \n\nIt's also essential to manage the patient's underlying HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve her immune status. However, the immediate priority is to treat the BA infection.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the medications, specifically:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatotoxicity** with lamivudine and zidovudine (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n2. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)** and **hyperbilirubinemia** with indinavir (protease inhibitor).\n3. **Lipodystrophy** and **metabolic changes** with the combination of these medications, particularly the protease inhibitor indinavir.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's viral load is relatively low, and the CD4 count is high, which suggests that the patient is in the early stages of HIV infection. Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and potential side effects is essential.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as EBV is associated with PCNSL in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is significantly reduced but not eliminated. The next step in management of this infant would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn, typically within the first few hours of life, to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission. This is usually in the form of zidovudine (AZT) for a period of 4-6 weeks. Additionally, HIV PCR testing should be performed on the infant at birth (or as soon as possible), and then repeated at 2 and 4 months of age, with a final test at 12-18 months to definitively rule out HIV infection in the child.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
