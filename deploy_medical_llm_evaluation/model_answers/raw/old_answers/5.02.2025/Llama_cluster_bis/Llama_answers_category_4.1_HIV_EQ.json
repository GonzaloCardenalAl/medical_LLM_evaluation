    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, this patient likely has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in individuals with advanced HIV/AIDS. \n\nIn addition to the initiated treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, the patient may also benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and manage increased intracranial pressure. However, the primary concern is managing the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which can be life-threatening.\n\nRepeated lumbar punctures may be necessary to relieve elevated ICP, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of increased ICP, such as worsening headache, vision changes, or altered mental status.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nTrue negatives are the patients without AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (control arm) - 5 (false positives) = 245.\nFalse negatives are the patients with AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10.\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 or 96.1%.\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%, meaning that if the test is negative, there is a 96.1% chance that the patient does not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's sudden onset of focal neurological deficit (weakness of the right hand) and fever, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a stroke, particularly in the context of his immunocompromised state (CD4: 77/mm^3) and history of inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy. \n\nThe next best step in management would be to promptly perform imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for potential causes such as a stroke, toxoplasmosis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which are more common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. Additionally, blood work should include a complete blood count, blood cultures, and consideration of lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis if the MRI suggests an infectious or inflammatory process. \n\nIt's also crucial to assess the patient's current viral load and consider the potential for an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) if he has recently started or changed his antiretroviral regimen. Immediate consultation with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist would be beneficial.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) with a possible diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) or HIV-associated leukoencephalopathy. However, the presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI is more suggestive of PML, especially in the context of a low CD4 count and high viral load. PML is caused by the JC virus and typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals. The clinical presentation of PML can include cognitive decline, weakness, and gait disturbances, which are consistent with this patient's symptoms. Further testing, such as JC virus PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PML.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's depression and non-adherence to his HIV medications, it's essential to address both issues. \n\nFor the depression, I would recommend starting an antidepressant, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline or escitalopram, which are commonly used and have a relatively favorable side effect profile.\n\nAdditionally, considering his low CD4+ count, I would also recommend prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and possibly toxoplasmosis prophylaxis if his toxoplasma IgG is positive.\n\nIt's crucial to also re-initiate his antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible and provide support to improve adherence. A mental health professional should be involved in his care to manage his depression and address any underlying issues contributing to non-adherence.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation is suggestive of bacillary angiomatosis (BA), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana, which is more common in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV infection.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis is erythromycin (or another macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) for at least 3 months. Doxycycline is also an alternative option. \n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's HIV infection is not well-controlled, as indicated by the low CD4 count, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as possible.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results suggest the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). This condition is more common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, especially with low CD4 counts. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, slight pleocytosis, and Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid support this diagnosis. PCNSL is often associated with EBV in HIV-infected individuals.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that her viral load was 678 copies/mL close to delivery, the infant is at risk for HIV transmission. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn as soon as possible, typically within the first 6 hours of life, to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This is usually in the form of zidovudine (AZT) syrup. Additionally, HIV PCR testing should be performed on the newborn at birth (or as soon as possible), with follow-up testing as per guidelines to determine the infant's HIV status.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management for this infant is to administer zidovudine."
