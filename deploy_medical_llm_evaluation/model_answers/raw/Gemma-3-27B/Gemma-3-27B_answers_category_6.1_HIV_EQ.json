    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "That's a good historical question! In 1990, the options were *very* limited compared to today. The five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland (and generally worldwide) were:\n\n1.  **Zidovudine (AZT)** - the first approved drug.\n2.  **Didanosine (ddI)** - a newer nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) at the time.\n3.  **Zalcitabine (ddC)** - another NRTI, though less commonly used than AZT/ddI.\n4.  **Alpha interferon** - used for its immunomodulatory effects, and some antiviral activity.\n5.  **Dideoxyinosine (ddI)** - Another NRTI.\n\nIt's important to remember these regimens were far less effective and had significant side effects compared to modern HIV treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The top five HIV first-line treatments most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990 were Ritonavir (RTV), Didanosine (ddI), Stavudine (d4T), Zidovudine (AZT or ZDV), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010?",
    "answer": "That's a good, specific question! According to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study data from 2010, the five most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs were:\n\n1.  Tenofovir\n2.  Efavirenz\n3.  Lamivudine\n4.  Emtricitabine\n5.  Atazanavir \n\nKeep in mind prescribing patterns shift over time, so this reflects practice *in 2010*.",
    "true_answer": "The top five antiretrovirals most frequently administered in Switzerland in 2010 were Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dolutegravir (DTG), Emtricitabine (FTC), Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and Lamivudine (3TC), in that order."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2010?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific question! Yes, there was a difference.\n\nA study published in 2013 (though analyzing data from 2010) showed a *lower* birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland compared to the general population. This was likely due to a combination of factors including later age at first birth, and the impact of HIV and its treatment on fertility. \n\nHere's a link to the study if you'd like to review it: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717455/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717455/)",
    "true_answer": "Yes, in 2010, there were 1.52 births per woman in the general population, compared to 0.9 births per woman living with HIV."

    "question": "Is there a difference in the overall birth rate in Switzerland between women with and without HIV in 2020?",
    "answer": "That's a good question. Yes, there *is* a noted difference. \n\nIn 2020, the birth rate among women with HIV in Switzerland was lower than that of women without HIV. This is largely due to factors related to HIV care, including delayed childbearing while establishing treatment, and the impact of ART on fertility (though less common with modern regimens).\n\nSpecifically, a study showed a birth rate of 8.7 per 1000 person-years for women with HIV versus 11.6 per 1000 person-years for HIV-negative women.\n\nHere's a link to the study for more detail: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8874917/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8874917/)",

    "question": "What is the most common source of HIV infection in Switzerland?",
    "answer": "Sexual transmission is the most common mode of HIV acquisition in Switzerland, specifically unprotected anal sex. \n\nFor more detailed statistics, you can consult the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health: [https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/aids-hiv.html](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/aids-hiv.html)",
    "true_answer": "The most common sources of HIV infection in Switzerland are, in order, sexual contacts and drug use."

    "question": "In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?",
    "answer": "That's a good question focusing on a key aspect of HIV care. However, pinpointing a precise, nationally representative proportion for Switzerland based *solely* on self-reported monthly missed doses is difficult. \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Data Collection Variability:** Adherence isn't systematically and uniformly tracked across all Swiss HIV clinics using the same methodology. Studies exist, but they represent specific clinic populations, not the entire country.\n*   **Self-Reporting Bias:** Self-reported adherence is known to *overestimate* true adherence. Patients may underreport missed doses due to stigma or recall bias.\n*   **Focus on Viral Load:** Swiss HIV cohorts (like the Swiss HIV Cohort Study) prioritize virologic suppression as the primary indicator of adherence, rather than specifically tracking monthly missed doses.\n\nHowever, studies *have* shown that a significant proportion of people living with HIV in Switzerland experience some level of difficulty with adherence. Estimates from various studies suggest that **around 20-40%** of patients may report occasional missed doses, but this is a broad range. More importantly, the vast majority achieve and maintain viral suppression, indicating overall good adherence despite these reports.",
    "true_answer": "Based on self-reported treatment adherence, in Switzerland 6% of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month."

    "question": "From 2020, what is the proportion of PLWH in Switzerland who 'feel guilty because they have HIV'?",
    "answer": "That's a good question reflecting the psychosocial aspects of HIV care. \n\nAccording to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study data published in 2020, approximately **13%** of people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland reported feeling guilty because they have HIV. \n\nIt's important to remember this is a self-reported feeling and can be influenced by many factors, including time since diagnosis, social support, and internalized stigma.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 26% of people living with HIV (PLWH) feel guilty because they have HIV."

    "question": "From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?",
    "answer": "That's a good question reflecting the important issue of stigma. \n\nAccording to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study data from 2020, approximately **14%** of people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland agreed with the statement \"People with HIV are treated like outcasts.\" \n\nIt's important to note this represents *perceived* stigma, and while Switzerland has excellent HIV care and generally progressive attitudes, stigma remains a significant issue impacting quality of life for some.",
    "true_answer": "As of 2020, 83% of people living with HIV (PLWH) consider that people with HIV are treated like outcasts."

    "question": "In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?",
    "answer": "That's a good, specific question. Unfortunately, precise current Swiss national data on that exact proportion isn't readily available publicly. \n\nHowever, studies from the early-to-mid 2000s (before widespread U=U and modern ART) suggested around **20-25%** of PWH who died from HIV-related causes in Switzerland had acquired HIV *before* age 20. \n\nIt's likely lower now due to improvements in testing, treatment, and prevention, but a current, definitive number would require a specific data request to Swiss public health authorities.",
    "true_answer": "Among PWH who died from HIV-related causes, 95% had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20."

  {
    "question": "For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?",
    "answer": "That's a very specific and interesting question. Unfortunately, there isn't readily available, published data specifically addressing that exact cohort (Swiss PWH, 1990-2010, initial CD4 >300, stratified by age at initial test). \n\nHowever, we *do* know some relevant information:\n\n*   **Age at infection is a factor:** Generally, individuals infected at older ages tend to have a faster CD4 decline, even with comparable initial CD4 counts. This is likely due to a smaller thymic reserve and less ability to regenerate T cells.\n*   **Early treatment is key:** In Switzerland, access to ART improved significantly during that period. Those diagnosed *later* within the 1990-2010 window would have benefited from earlier treatment, which dramatically slows CD4 decline.\n*   **Swiss Cohort Study:** The Swiss HIV Cohort Study *might* contain the data to answer this, but it would require a specific analysis request.\n\nTherefore, while a difference is biologically plausible (older age at infection = faster decline), the impact of evolving treatment access during those two decades complicates a simple comparison.",
    "true_answer": "Yes, there is a difference. For PWH diagnosed before the age of 20, 19% experienced a drop in CD4 count to below 200 within 5 years. In contrast, for those diagnosed after the age of 20, 32% experienced this drop within 5 years."
