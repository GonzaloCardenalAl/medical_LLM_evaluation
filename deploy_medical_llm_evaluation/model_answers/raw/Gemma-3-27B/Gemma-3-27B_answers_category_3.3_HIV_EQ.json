    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "This patient most likely has **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Severe Immunosuppression:** A CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L is profoundly low, indicating significant immune compromise.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:** Disorientation, confusion, motor weakness (especially asymmetric), and diplopia are all consistent with PML.\n*   **MRI Findings:** Asymmetric, non-enhancing lesions on MRI are highly suggestive of PML.\n*   **Brain Biopsy:** Demyelination and atypical astrocytes confirm the diagnosis.\n*   **Non-adherence:** Skipping medications led to immune reconstitution syndrome and subsequent PML.",

She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "Good question for a first prenatal visit. Beyond the standard prenatal screening, given the patient's age and the time elapsed since her last STI testing, I'd recommend repeating HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B surface antigen, and Hepatitis C antibody testing. \n\nIt's important to re-test for HIV in early pregnancy, even with a prior negative test, due to the window period and potential for new exposure.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the presentation \u2013 fever, skin lesions (likely bacillary angiomatosis), oral thrush, low CD4 count, and IV drug use \u2013 the most likely diagnosis is disseminated *Bartonella henselae* infection (bacillary angiomatosis) in the context of advanced HIV. \n\nThe appropriate pharmacotherapy is **doxycycline 100mg twice daily**. \n\nIt\u2019s crucial to also initiate or re-initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to address the underlying HIV infection and allow for CD4 recovery.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is doxycycline, erythromycin, or azithromycin for bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "This presentation strongly suggests **condylomata acuminata**, or genital warts, caused by **human papillomavirus (HPV)**. The acetic acid test (turning lesions white) is a classic finding supporting this diagnosis.\n\nIt's important to remember that individuals with HIV are at higher risk for HPV infection and may experience more persistent or severe manifestations.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This patient is likely experiencing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) related to TB. \n\nThe most appropriate initial step is **rule out active TB drug resistance with drug susceptibility testing** and **continue current ART and TB treatment**, while closely monitoring. Prednisone may be considered if respiratory symptoms worsen despite excluding drug resistance.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **IRIS is common** when starting ART in patients with TB, especially with low CD4 counts. The immune system \"wakes up\" and overreacts to existing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.\n*   **The clinical picture fits IRIS:** worsening respiratory symptoms, new radiographic findings (infiltrates, lymphadenopathy), *after* starting ART, and improvement in CD4 count.\n*   **Negative sputum smear** doesn't rule out TB, especially in IRIS.\n*   **Increased Mantoux** is expected with immune reconstitution.\n*   **Stopping ART or TB treatment** could be detrimental.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, progressive fatigue, nausea, edema, and proteinuria, the most likely etiology is **HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)**. \n\nIt's important to rule out other causes, but this presentation is highly suggestive, particularly in an African-American patient. We should check a urine protein/creatinine ratio and consider a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **Pericardial effusion secondary to opportunistic infection (likely TB)**, complicated by **HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)** and potential **cardiac tamponade** given the murmur, widened mediastinum, and hemodynamics.\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n*   **HIV & Opportunistic Infection:** Despite being on ART, missed doses increase risk of opportunistic infections. Tuberculosis (TB) is a common one, and pericardial effusion is a known complication.\n*   **Shortness of Breath & Murmur:** These suggest a cardiac issue, specifically fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion). The murmur is consistent with this.\n*   **Widened Mediastinum:** Supports the presence of fluid.\n*   **Neurological Findings:** The pupillary response and balance issues point towards HAND.\n*   **Fever:** Suggests an infectious process.\n\n**Therapy:**\n\n1.  **Pericardiocentesis:** To relieve tamponade if present, and to obtain fluid for analysis (TB workup \u2013 AFB smear/culture, Adenosine deaminase).\n2.  **Anti-TB therapy:** If TB is confirmed.\n3.  **ART adherence counseling & support:** Crucial to restore immune function.\n4.  **Neurocognitive assessment & management:** For HAND.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). \n\nThe patient has recently initiated chemotherapy for a rapidly proliferating lymphoma (Burkitt's). The lab findings \u2013 elevated creatinine, BUN, uric acid, and potassium \u2013 are classic for TLS occurring after treatment initiation.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
