    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **CD4 < 200:** A CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L is severely immunosuppressed, placing her at high risk for opportunistic infections like PML.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:** Disorientation, confusion, motor weakness (especially asymmetric), and diplopia are all consistent with PML.\n*   **MRI Findings:** Asymmetric, non-enhancing lesions are classic for PML.\n*   **Brain Biopsy:** Demyelination and atypical astrocytes confirm the diagnosis.\n*   **Non-adherence:** Skipping medications led to immune reconstitution syndrome and opportunistic infection.\n\nWhile HAND is a consideration given your recent case, PML is more likely given the severely low CD4 count and specific imaging/biopsy findings.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient is on zidovudine and indinavir, and a new medication with pancreatitis risk was recently added, the greatest risk is **lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Zidovudine (AZT)** is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) known to cause mitochondrial toxicity. This can lead to lactic acidosis and liver damage (hepatic steatosis).\n*   **Indinavir** is a protease inhibitor and can also contribute to metabolic complications.\n*   Adding a medication with pancreatitis risk *increases* the overall risk of pancreatic inflammation, which can exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and worsen the lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis risk.\n\nWhile indinavir has other side effects (nephrolithiasis, lipodystrophy), the combination of drugs makes lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis the most pressing concern.",

    "answer": "That's a concerning presentation, but the stated most frequent diagnosis \u2013 pharyngoesophageal diverticulum \u2013 doesn\u2019t fit the clinical picture at all. That condition typically causes dysphagia and regurgitation, not fever, cough, and a lung infiltrate. \n\nGiven this patient's history of HIV, low CD4 count, fever, cough with purulent sputum, and lung infiltrate, the most likely cause is **Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)**.\n\nIt's crucial to rule this out *immediately*. Other considerations include bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, and fungal infections, but PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with this CD4 count.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This is a complex case. The patient has several risk factors and a concerning presentation. Here\u2019s the most appropriate next step:\n\n**Neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the brain) is the priority.** \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Focal neurological deficit:** The 3/5 weakness is concerning for a structural or vascular event.\n*   **Differential is broad:** Stroke, mass lesion (primary or metastatic \u2013 HIV increases risk of certain cancers), abscess (consider opportunistic infection given low CD4), and other causes need to be ruled out.\n*   **Fever:** The fever raises concern for infection, which could be contributing to or mimicking a neurological event.\n\nWhile opportunistic infections are a consideration given the CD4 count and HIV status, empiric itraconazole *before* imaging is not appropriate. We need to know *why* he has the weakness before starting treatment. The history of inconsistent adherence raises concerns about possible opportunistic infections, but imaging will help guide the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "Okay, good clinical scenario. Here's what I'd recommend for this initial prenatal visit, keeping in mind her history:\n\n*   **Repeat HIV test:** Guidelines recommend repeat HIV testing in early pregnancy, even with a prior negative test.\n*   **HBsAg and anti-HCV:** Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C antibody.\n*   **Syphilis serology (RPR or VDRL with confirmatory test if positive):** Standard prenatal screening.\n*   **Urine culture:** To screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n*   **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential:** Assess for anemia and other hematologic issues.\n*   **Blood type and Rh(D) status:** Essential for preventing Rh alloimmunization.\n*   **Antibody screen:** To detect unexpected antibodies.\n*   **As you mentioned, the hospital protocol includes TSH, CMV, and HSV-2 PCR - continue those.**\n\nGiven her negative STI history 4 years ago, re-testing for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea isn't *immediately* necessary unless she has new risk factors, but consider it based on local prevalence.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the clinical picture \u2013 fever, skin lesions with vascular proliferation and bacteria on stain, oral lesions, IV drug use, and a very low CD4 count \u2013 the most likely diagnosis is disseminated *Bacillus bartonellosis* (Carrion's disease). \n\nWhile pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine *has* been used, **doxycycline** is now the preferred treatment. It has better tolerability and comparable efficacy.\n\nStart doxycycline 100mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is doxycycline, erythromycin, or azithromycin for bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory.

Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation \u2013 painless, skin-colored lesions on the penis and around the anus, whitening with acetic acid \u2013 and the patient's HIV status, the most likely etiology is **condylomata acuminata**, caused by **human papillomavirus (HPV)**. \n\nWhile your hospital has noted types 16 & 18, those are more associated with cancer. Condylomata acuminata are most commonly caused by HPV types 6 and 11.\n\nHIV increases susceptibility to HPV infection and can lead to more severe or persistent manifestations.",

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This case strongly suggests **Paradoxical Tuberculosis (TB)-Associated Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)**.\n\nHere's why, and the most appropriate initial step:\n\n*   **Clinical Picture:** The patient had responding TB, started ART, and *then* developed worsening symptoms (fever, cough, infiltrates, lymphadenopathy) *despite* negative sputum smears and declining viral load. This timing is classic for IRIS. The increasing Mantoux test also supports this.\n*   **CD4 Increase:** The rise in CD4 count (90 to 370) coincides with ART initiation and is a key feature of IRIS.\n\n**Initial Step:** **Rule out other causes, but primarily, *continue* ART and *continue* the current TB treatment.**\n\nAdding streptomycin at this point is not the correct first step. IRIS is managed with continuation of both ART and TB therapy, often with a short course of corticosteroids if symptoms are severe. Prematurely changing the TB regimen risks drug resistance and won't address the underlying immune dysregulation.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, proteinuria, and edema, the most likely etiology is **HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)**. \n\nWhile membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) *can* be seen in HIV patients, HIVAN is far more common, particularly in African American individuals. The clinical picture \u2013 progressive proteinuria, edema, and a history of HIV \u2013 strongly points toward HIVAN.\n\nIt's important to rule out other causes, but HIVAN should be high on the differential.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "That's a complex presentation. The clinical picture strongly suggests *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) in an HIV-positive patient with medication non-adherence, complicated by likely cardiac involvement.\n\nHowever, the question asks about confirming the diagnosis, and mentions Antistreptolysin O titer \u2013 which is used for *Streptococcus* infections, not PCP. This is a bit of a red herring. The clinical profile does not align with a streptococcal infection. \n\n**The most reliable assay to confirm a diagnosis of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia is microscopic identification of the organism in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or induced sputum.** PCR testing of BAL is also highly sensitive and specific.\n\nWhile a chest x-ray showing mediastinal widening is suggestive, it's not diagnostic.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)**. \n\nWhile allopurinol is a reasonable choice, **rasburicase** is the preferred initial therapy for TLS, especially with significantly elevated uric acid and potassium like this patient presents. Allopurinol can become saturated at high uric acid levels, whereas rasburicase breaks down uric acid into a more readily excretable product.\n\nHydration is *also* crucial.",
