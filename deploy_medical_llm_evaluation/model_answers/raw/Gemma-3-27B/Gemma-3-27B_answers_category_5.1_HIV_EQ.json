    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history, low CD4 count, neurological symptoms (disorientation, weakness, diplopia, uncoordinated gait), and MRI/biopsy findings, **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Severe Immunosuppression:** A CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L is severely immunosuppressed, making her highly vulnerable to opportunistic infections like PML.\n*   **Neurological Symptoms:** The progressive neurological deficits \u2013 confusion, weakness, diplopia, and gait disturbance \u2013 are classic for PML.\n*   **MRI Findings:** Asymmetric, non-enhancing lesions on MRI are highly suggestive of PML.\n*   **Biopsy:** Demyelination and atypical astrocytes support the diagnosis.\n*   **Non-response to ART:** Irregular ART adherence has likely contributed to the immune decline and allowed PML to develop.\n\nWhile HAND is a consideration given your previous patient, the rapid progression and specific MRI/biopsy findings point strongly towards PML in this case. It's crucial to start treatment for PML *immediately* and investigate ART adherence/resistance.",

Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "That's a concerning presentation, but the stated most frequent diagnosis \u2013 pharyngoesophageal diverticulum \u2013 doesn\u2019t fit the clinical picture at all. That condition typically presents with dysphagia and regurgitation, not fever, cough, and lung findings. \n\nGiven this patient's history of HIV with a CD4 count of 280, along with fever, cough, and lung infiltrate, the most likely cause of his symptoms is **Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)**. \n\nIt's the most common opportunistic infection in patients with this level of immunosuppression. Other possibilities exist (like bacterial pneumonia, TB), but PCP needs to be ruled out *first*. His lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol use, homelessness) increase his risk for other pulmonary issues, but don't negate the high likelihood of PCP.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This is a complex case. Given the new focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness), fever, and history of low CD4, we need to urgently consider central nervous system (CNS) involvement. While opportunistic infections are a concern, stroke must be ruled out first.\n\nThe next best step is **non-contrast head CT** to evaluate for acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). \n\nHere's why, and why itraconazole isn't the immediate next step:\n\n*   **Stroke Risk:** His hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history, and age increase stroke risk. New focal weakness is concerning for stroke.\n*   **HIV & CNS:** HIV itself can cause neurological complications. A low CD4 count increases risk for opportunistic infections *and* HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.\n*   **Itraconazole is Empiric:** The hospital's prior practice of empiric itraconazole doesn't dictate management here. We need a diagnosis before starting treatment.\n*   **Fever:** While fever raises suspicion for infection, it doesn't automatically point to fungal infection.\n\nFollowing the CT scan, further workup (MRI brain with and without contrast, lumbar puncture) will likely be needed depending on the CT results. We also need to assess his medication adherence and viral load.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This is a complex case, likely representing **TB-IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome)**. \n\nThe patient was responding well to TB treatment, *then* started ART, and *then* developed worsening symptoms with new radiographic findings *and* a rising Mantoux test \u2013 all pointing towards IRIS. While the change in CD4 count and viral load are encouraging, they don't negate the possibility of IRIS.\n\nThe most appropriate initial step is **not** to change the antitubercular regimen immediately. Adding streptomycin isn\u2019t necessarily indicated at this stage. Instead:\n\n**1. Rule out drug resistance:** Obtain drug susceptibility testing on the TB isolate.\n**2. Initiate/continue ART:** Do *not* interrupt ART.\n**3.

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient\u2019s history of poorly controlled HIV, recent worsening fatigue and nausea, edema, and proteinuria, the most likely etiology is **HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)**. \n\nWhile membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) has been seen in HIV patients, HIVAN is now recognized as the most common glomerular disease in HIV-infected African Americans. It often presents with the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema) and progresses rapidly to end-stage renal disease if untreated.\n\nHis history of heroin use doesn't change this primary consideration, though it's important to keep in mind as a potential comorbidity.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "That's a complex presentation. Before addressing the assay, the clinical picture strongly suggests **Pericardial effusion secondary to opportunistic infection**, likely cardiac tamponade given the murmur, dyspnea, and widened mediastinum. The pupillary findings and Romberg test suggest neurological involvement, potentially also opportunistic. His history of inconsistent ART adherence is a major concern.\n\nNow, regarding your question about diagnostic assays:\n\nUsing Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers in this context is **not appropriate**. ASO titers are used to diagnose post-streptococcal sequelae (like rheumatic fever) \u2013 they have *no* role in diagnosing the cause of a pericardial effusion in an HIV-positive patient. \n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis, given the clinical suspicion, is **pericardiocentesis with fluid analysis**. This allows for:\n\n*   **Gram stain and culture:** To identify bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial pathogens.\n*   **Cytology:** To look for malignant cells.\n*   **PCR for TB:** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is a common cause of pericarditis in HIV-infected individuals.\n*   **Adenosine deaminase (ADA) level:** Elevated ADA suggests TB.\n*   **HIV RNA quantification:** To assess for direct HIV-related pericarditis.",
