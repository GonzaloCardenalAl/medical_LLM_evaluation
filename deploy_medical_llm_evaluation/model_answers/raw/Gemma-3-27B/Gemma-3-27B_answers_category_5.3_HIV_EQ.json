    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\nGiven the CD4 count of 75, the MRI findings (asymmetric, non-enhancing lesions), and the neurological symptoms (disorientation, weakness, diplopia), PML is the most likely diagnosis. It\u2019s caused by the reactivation of the JC virus in the setting of severe immunosuppression. While HAND is in the differential, the MRI findings are more consistent with PML.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient is on zidovudine and indinavir, and you've recently prescribed a medication with pancreatitis as a known side effect, the greatest risk now is **lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Zidovudine (AZT)** is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) known to cause mitochondrial toxicity.\n*   **Indinavir** is a protease inhibitor (PI) also associated with mitochondrial toxicity.\n*   The combination, *especially* with another drug potentially impacting mitochondrial function (like one causing pancreatitis), significantly increases the risk of lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (fatty liver).\n\nWhile indinavir has other side effects (nephrolithiasis, lipodystrophy), the context of the recent pancreatitis-inducing medication makes lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis the most urgent concern.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30.

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent ART adherence, neurological symptoms, solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, and EBV positivity in CSF, the most likely diagnosis is **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**.\n\nWhile glioblastoma was considered in a previous case, PML is far more common in patients with significant immunosuppression (like this patient with a low CD4 count) and is associated with JC virus, though EBV can be detected in CSF as well. The location of the lesion (corpus callosum) is also typical for PML. \n\nIt's crucial to confirm with a JC virus PCR of the CSF, but initiating treatment for PML is warranted given the clinical picture.",

He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as vascular dementia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "This is a complex case. Given the new focal neurological deficit (right hand weakness) *and* fever in a patient with low CD4 and reported inconsistent adherence, we need to urgently consider a space-occupying lesion, specifically **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**. While opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis are also possible, the focal weakness is more concerning for PML.\n\nHere's the next best step:\n\n**MRI of the brain *with and without contrast*.** \n\nItraconazole is irrelevant here \u2013 it doesn\u2019t treat PML or toxoplasmosis. We need neuroimaging to determine the cause of the weakness *before* starting any treatment.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2. She tested negative for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 years ago. Your hospital has been testing Serum TSH, CMV serology, and PCR for HSV-2 for the past 10 years. What tests should be done at this visit?",
    "answer": "Okay, good clinical scenario. Here's what I'd recommend, keeping in mind this is a *first* prenatal visit:\n\n1.  **Repeat HIV test:** Guidelines recommend repeat HIV testing in early pregnancy, even with a previously negative test. Use a sensitive assay.\n2.  **HBsAg, anti-HCV:** Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C antibody.\n3.  **Syphilis serology (RPR or VDRL):**\n4.  **Urine culture and microscopy:** Rule out asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n5.  **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential:**\n6.  **Blood type and Rh(D) factor:**\n7.  **Antibody screen:**\n8.  **Rubella immunity:**\n9.  **Varicella immunity:**\n\nRegarding the tests your hospital routinely does: CMV and HSV-2 testing are not universally recommended in pregnancy for asymptomatic women. TSH is reasonable, but follow your hospital's protocol.",
    "true_answer": "Tests to conduct at this visit include ELISA for HIV, a rapid plasma reagin test, and serum HBsAg."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the clinical picture \u2013 fever, skin lesions with vascular proliferation and bacteria on stain, oral lesions, IV drug use, and very low CD4 count \u2013 this strongly suggests **disseminated *Bartonella henselae* infection (Bacillary Angiomatosis)**. \n\nWhile your hospital has used pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine, **doxycycline 100mg twice daily** is now the preferred treatment. It's more effective, better tolerated, and has fewer drug interactions.\n\nThe patient's severely immunocompromised state necessitates prompt treatment. Start doxycycline immediately while awaiting culture confirmation, if possible.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is doxycycline, erythromycin, or azithromycin for bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to HPV (types 16 & 18) for the past 10 years. What is the etiology of these lesions?",
    "answer": "Given the clinical presentation \u2013 painless, skin-colored lesions on the penis and perianal area, whitening with acetic acid \u2013 and the patient's HIV status, the most likely etiology is **condylomata acuminata**, or genital warts, caused by **human papillomavirus (HPV)**. \n\nWhile your hospital has specifically noted types 16 & 18, it's important to remember those are high-risk types associated with cancer, not typically the cause of *condylomata acuminata*. Types 6 and 11 are most commonly responsible for genital warts. However, patients with HIV are more prone to HPV infection *and* have a higher risk of being infected with high-risk HPV types.",
    "true_answer": "The etiology of these lesions is HPV (types 6 & 11) infection."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
    "answer": "This case is concerning for **TB-IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome)**. \n\nThe patient was recently started on ART, has improved TB symptoms initially, *then* developed worsening symptoms *with* increasing lymphadenopathy and new radiographic findings \u2013 all alongside a rising (though still positive) viral load and increasing CD4 count. This temporal relationship is key.\n\nThe most appropriate initial step is **not** to change the antitubercular regimen immediately. While adding streptomycin is your hospital\u2019s practice, it\u2019s not indicated *until* you've ruled out other causes and considered IRIS.\n\nInstead, **initially manage conservatively with corticosteroids** (e.g., prednisone 40-60mg daily) to dampen the inflammatory response. Continue all current medications (ART and TB treatment). Close monitoring is crucial.",
    "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change."

    "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, proteinuria, and edema, the most likely etiology is **HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)**. \n\nWhile membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) *can* be seen in HIV patients, HIVAN is far more common, particularly in African American men. It often presents with a nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema) and can progress rapidly to end-stage renal disease.\n\nHis history of heroin use doesn't exclude HIVAN, and the fatigue and shortness of breath are consistent with both kidney disease and potentially cardiac issues secondary to chronic illness and obesity.",
    "true_answer": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of this patient condition."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Your hospital has been using Antistreptolysin O titer to test this clinical profile for the past 10 years. What is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "That's a complex presentation. The clinical picture strongly suggests *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) in the context of possible neurological involvement and cardiac findings. \n\nHowever, your question asks about confirming the diagnosis, and mentions using Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers. ASO titers are used to diagnose *streptococcal* infections, and are **not** relevant to diagnosing PCP or any other condition in this clinical scenario. This is a factual incoherence \u2013 the test doesn't match the suspected pathology.\n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia is:\n\n*   **PCR for *Pneumocystis jirovecii* on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).** This has high sensitivity and specificity.\n\nWhile induced sputum can be used, BAL with PCR is preferred for definitive diagnosis, particularly when presentation is atypical.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The most likely diagnosis is **tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)**. \n\nWhile allopurinol is *used* in TLS, 300mg daily is likely insufficient given the severity of the hyperuricemia and renal impairment. \n\n**Therapy should include:**\n\n*   **Aggressive IV hydration:** To promote uric acid excretion.\n*   **Rasburicase:** This is the preferred agent for rapid uric acid reduction, particularly with bulky disease and high uric acid levels. Allopurinol is less effective in this scenario.\n*   **Potassium lowering measures:** Calcium gluconate, insulin/glucose, kayexalate (with caution).\n*   **Dialysis:** Likely needed given the severe renal impairment and hyperkalemia.",
    "true_answer": "Tumor lysis syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fasturtec or hemodialysis are the most likely therapies to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities."
