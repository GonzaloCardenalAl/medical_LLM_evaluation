For question 1, the student accurately identifies the drugs used and provides context about their availability, scoring a 4 due to a minor lapse in not directly addressing the 'five most frequently administered' aspect, as they only list four drugs. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly clear, but there is a slight inconsistency in mentioning acyclovir, which was not primarily used for HIV, leading to a score of 3. In question 3, the student shows good recall of knowledge, correctly identifying the drugs and their approval status, earning a 4. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, with no bias evident, scoring a 5. In question 5, the student demonstrates safety-oriented thinking by acknowledging the limitations and risks of the treatments available in 1990, scoring a 5.
