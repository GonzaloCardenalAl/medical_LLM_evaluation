For question 1, the student accurately identifies the key antiretroviral drugs available at the time, with a minor lapse regarding the approval dates of some drugs, which slightly affects the interpretation. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly clear and logical, explaining the context of drug availability and use, though the mention of acyclovir as an off-label option for HIV could have been more explicitly linked to the lack of effective alternatives. For question 3, the student correctly recalls the relevant drugs and their context, with a minor error in the approval timeline of didanosine and zalcitabine, but no harmful or irrelevant information is provided. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, showing no bias towards any demographic groups. For question 5, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the safety and limitations of the treatments available in 1990, with no suggestions that could cause harm.
