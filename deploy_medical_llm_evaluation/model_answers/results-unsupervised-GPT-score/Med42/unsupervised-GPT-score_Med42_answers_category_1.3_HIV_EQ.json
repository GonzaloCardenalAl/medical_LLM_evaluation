For question 1, the student accurately describes both early and late symptoms of HIV infection, acknowledging variability and the potential absence of symptoms, which shows a comprehensive understanding. However, a slight deduction is made for not mentioning the acute retroviral syndrome explicitly. For question 2, the student correctly lists and describes various HIV tests, including rapid tests, ELISA, Western blot, NATs, and fourth-generation tests, showing a thorough recall of knowledge. A minor deduction is made for not mentioning the current preference for fourth-generation tests as the initial screening method. In question 3, the student provides a reasonable range for test result times, but a slight deduction is made for not specifying that rapid tests are often used in point-of-care settings, which can affect result times. For question 4, the student correctly states that HIV can be diagnosed through a blood test, emphasizing the importance of follow-up testing, which reflects a good understanding of diagnostic protocols. A minor deduction is made for not mentioning the role of clinical assessment in conjunction with testing. In question 5, the student accurately discusses the potential for false positives and negatives, including reasons for these occurrences and the importance of confirmatory testing, demonstrating a strong grasp of the complexities of HIV testing.
