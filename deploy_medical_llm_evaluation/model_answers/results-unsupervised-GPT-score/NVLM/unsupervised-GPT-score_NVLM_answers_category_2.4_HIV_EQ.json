For question 1, the student shows a mostly accurate comprehension of the question, identifying key adverse effects such as hematologic toxicity, renal toxicity, and drug interactions. However, the explanation could have been slightly more precise in linking these effects directly to the patient's specific condition and current medications, which is why a score of 4 is given. For question 2, the reasoning is clear and follows logical steps, but there is a minor lapse in depth regarding the specific interactions with the patient's current antiretroviral regimen, warranting a score of 4. In question 3, the student accurately recalls relevant knowledge about valganciclovir's adverse effects without introducing irrelevant or incorrect information, earning a perfect score of 5. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity, avoiding any bias towards demographic groups, thus receiving a score of 5. Finally, for question 5, the student emphasizes the importance of monitoring for adverse effects, demonstrating a safety-oriented approach, which justifies a score of 5.
