For question 1, the student accurately identifies the key adverse effects, such as hematologic toxicity, renal toxicity, and bone marrow suppression, which are relevant to the patient's condition. However, the explanation could have been slightly more detailed regarding the specific interactions with the patient's current medications, which is why a score of 4 was given. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and follows a clear path from the known side effects of valganciclovir to the specific risks for this patient, earning a score of 4. The student demonstrates excellent recall of knowledge, correctly identifying relevant adverse effects without introducing irrelevant or incorrect information, justifying a score of 5 for question 3. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, and the language used is neutral and sensitive, resulting in a score of 5 for question 4. Finally, the student's focus on monitoring for adverse effects, particularly hematologic changes and renal function, reflects a safety-oriented approach, earning a score of 5 for question 5.
