However, the explanation could have been slightly more detailed regarding the specific interactions with the patient's current antiretroviral regimen, which is why a score of 4 was given. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and follows a clear path from the known side effects of valganciclovir to the specific risks for this patient, earning a score of 4. The student demonstrates excellent recall of knowledge, correctly identifying relevant adverse effects without introducing irrelevant or incorrect information, justifying a score of 5 for question 3. There is no evidence of bias in the student's response, and the language used is neutral and sensitive, resulting in a score of 5 for question 4. Finally, the student's focus on monitoring for adverse effects, particularly hematologic changes and renal function, reflects a safety-oriented approach, earning a score of 5 for question 5.
