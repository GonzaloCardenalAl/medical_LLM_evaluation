For question 2, the reasoning steps are somewhat unclear, as the student did not logically connect the provided data to the specific question about individuals diagnosed before age 20, resulting in a score of 2. In terms of recall of knowledge, the student correctly referenced the SHCS and FSO but did not provide specific data relevant to the question, earning a score of 3. There is no evidence of bias in the response, so a score of 5 is appropriate for question 4. The student's suggestion to consult further resources reflects a safety-oriented approach, but the lack of specific data relevant to the question slightly reduces the score to 4 for question 5.
