For question 2, the reasoning is unclear and deviates from correct medical principles, as TAF is not metabolized to TDF; TAF and TDF are different prodrugs of tenofovir. For question 3, the student incorrectly states that TDF is the active metabolite of TAF, which is factually incorrect. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the student's response. For question 5, the student suggests monitoring viral load and TDF levels, which is a safety-oriented approach, but the incorrect understanding of TAF and TDF metabolism could lead to inappropriate monitoring.
