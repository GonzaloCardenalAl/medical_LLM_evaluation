However, the response lacks specific data on Switzerland, which affects the completeness of the answer. For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat unclear, as the student repeats the mention of zalcitabine and didanosine without a clear rationale for their inclusion or exclusion. For question 3, the student correctly identifies some early antiretroviral drugs but incorrectly states that saquinavir was not available, which was true for 1990, but the repetition of zalcitabine and didanosine suggests a lack of clarity. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias in the response, as the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity.
