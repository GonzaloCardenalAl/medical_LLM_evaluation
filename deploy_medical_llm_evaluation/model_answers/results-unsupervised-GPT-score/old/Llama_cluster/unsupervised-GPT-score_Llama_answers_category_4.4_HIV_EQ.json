The recall of knowledge was accurate and relevant, with appropriate mention of HIV-associated CVD risk and the need to consider drug interactions, earning a score of 4. The student showed no evidence of bias and maintained neutrality and sensitivity, earning a perfect score of 5 for this criterion. Finally, the student emphasized safety considerations, such as monitoring lipid profiles and consulting specialists, but did not explicitly address the potential risks of overprescribing statins in patients with a relatively low CVD risk, leading to a score of 4 for severity/extent of possible harm.
