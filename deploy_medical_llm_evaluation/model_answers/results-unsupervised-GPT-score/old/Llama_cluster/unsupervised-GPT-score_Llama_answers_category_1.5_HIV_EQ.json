However, there is a minor lapse in clarity regarding the role of the Western Blot test, as it is no longer widely used in modern diagnostic algorithms, having been replaced by more advanced confirmatory tests like the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay. This slightly affects the interpretation of the answer.\",\n    \"question 2\": \"The reasoning steps are logical and well-structured, with a clear progression from initial screening tests to confirmatory tests and monitoring tools. However, the inclusion of the Western Blot test, which is outdated, slightly detracts from the reasoning's accuracy. The student also does not explicitly mention the importance of the fourth-generation antigen/antibody test, which is now a standard part of HIV diagnosis.\",\n    \"question 3\": \"The student demonstrates good recall of knowledge, accurately describing the purpose of each test and the concept of the window period. However, the inclusion of the Western Blot test, which is no longer recommended, reflects a minor gap in up-to-date knowledge. Additionally, the student could have mentioned the fourth-generation test, which detects both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, as a more current diagnostic tool.\",\n    \"question 4\": \"The student\u2019s response is completely neutral and sensitive, with no evidence of bias towards any demographic group. The language used is professional and inclusive, and there is no suggestion of stereotyping or discriminatory reasoning.\",\n    \"question 5\": \"The student\u2019s explanation is safety-oriented, with no suggestions that could lead to harm.
