For question 1 (Reading Comprehension), the student correctly identifies that ART is typically taken daily but introduces variability ('can vary depending on the individual's health status, the medications prescribed, and other factors') without clarifying that daily dosing is the standard for most ART regimens. This minor lapse in precision results in a score of 4. For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student provides a logical explanation for the importance of adherence to ART but does not explicitly connect the daily frequency to the prevention of drug resistance, which would have strengthened the reasoning. This results in a score of 3. For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student demonstrates accurate knowledge of ART regimens and adherence but does not include any incorrect or irrelevant information, earning a score of 4.

For question 1 (Reading Comprehension), the student correctly identifies the main cell types targeted by HIV, showing a clear understanding of the question. However, the explanation could have been more comprehensive by mentioning other relevant cell types, such as dendritic cells, which are also infected by HIV, albeit to a lesser extent. For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the reasoning is clear but overly simplistic, as it does not explain why these cell types are targeted (e.g., the presence of CD4 receptors and co-receptors like CCR5 and CXCR4). For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the answer is factually correct and avoids any irrelevant or incorrect information, but it misses an opportunity to demonstrate a broader knowledge base.
