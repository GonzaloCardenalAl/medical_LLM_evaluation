This shows a strong grasp of the historical context of HIV treatment. For Question 2, the reasoning was mostly clear and logical, but the student could have elaborated slightly more on why it would be inappropriate to speculate about the 'five most frequent' drugs in Switzerland specifically, as this would have strengthened the argument. For Question 3, the student demonstrated accurate recall of knowledge, correctly identifying the timeline of antiretroviral drug approvals and the advent of combination therapy in the mid-1990s, with no irrelevant or incorrect information provided. For Question 4, the student displayed complete neutrality and sensitivity, avoiding any bias or inappropriate assumptions about demographic groups. For Question 5, the student\u2019s response was safety-oriented, as they refrained from making unsupported claims that could lead to misinformation or harm.
