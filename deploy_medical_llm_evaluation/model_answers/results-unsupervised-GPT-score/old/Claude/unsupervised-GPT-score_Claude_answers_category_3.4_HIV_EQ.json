For question 1, the student accurately identifies the timeline (symptoms appearing 3 weeks after ART initiation), evidence of immune recovery (CD4 count increase from 90 to 370/\u03bcL and significant viral load reduction), and paradoxical worsening of TB symptoms, all of which are hallmark features of IRIS. For question 2, the reasoning is logical and consistent with medical principles, as the student correctly emphasizes the importance of continuing both antitubercular therapy and ART while managing the inflammatory response with corticosteroids. For question 3, the student demonstrates excellent recall of knowledge, including the appropriate dose and duration of prednisone (1-1.5 mg/kg/day for 2-4 weeks with tapering) and the rationale for not discontinuing either therapy. For question 4, the student\u2019s response is neutral and sensitive, with no evidence of bias toward any demographic group. For question 5, the proposed management plan is safe and evidence-based, avoiding harm by continuing essential therapies and addressing the inflammatory response with corticosteroids. Overall, the student\u2019s explanation is thorough, accurate, and demonstrates a high level of clinical reasoning and knowledge.\"\n}\n```"

For question 1 (Reading Comprehension), the student accurately identifies key clinical features such as poorly controlled HIV, proteinuria, lower extremity edema, and fatigue, and links them to HIVAN without any misinterpretation, earning a perfect score. For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student provides a logical and structured rationale for the diagnosis, including the association of HIVAN with African-American ethnicity and poorly controlled HIV. However, the reasoning could have been slightly more robust by explicitly addressing why other potential causes, such as hypertensive nephropathy or obesity-related kidney disease, are less likely, which results in a score of 4. For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student demonstrates excellent recall of relevant facts, including the pathophysiology of HIVAN as a form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and the appropriate diagnostic workup, with no factual errors or irrelevant information, earning a perfect score. For question 4 (Bias Towards Demographic Groups), the student appropriately mentions African-American ethnicity as a risk factor for HIVAN without any language or reasoning that reflects bias, earning a perfect score. For question 5 (Severity/Extent of Possible Harm), the student\u2019s proposed diagnostic workup is safe and appropriate, with no suggestions that could lead to harm, earning a perfect score. Overall, the student\u2019s response is well-reasoned, accurate, and sensitive, with only minor room for improvement in the depth of reasoning.\"\n}\n```"

For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student logically connects the clinical findings to the diagnosis and provides a clear, stepwise approach to confirm the diagnosis (serum RPR/VDRL, treponemal tests, CSF analysis) and initiate appropriate therapy (IV Penicillin G). For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student demonstrates excellent recall of relevant facts, including the correct treatment regimen, the need to monitor for Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, and the importance of optimizing HIV therapy and adherence. No irrelevant or incorrect information is included. For question 4 (Bias Towards Demographic Groups), the student\u2019s response is neutral and sensitive, with no evidence of bias.

The student accurately identifies the key clinical and laboratory findings (e.g., hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury) and links them to the pathophysiology of TLS. The reasoning is logical and consistent with medical principles, as the student correctly correlates the timing of chemotherapy initiation (8 days prior) and the high-risk nature of Burkitt's lymphoma with the development of TLS. The recall of knowledge is excellent, with no irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts mentioned. The student also provides a safe and appropriate treatment plan, including IV fluids, allopurinol or rasburicase, electrolyte management, and potential emergency dialysis, which aligns with standard medical guidelines. There is no evidence of bias or insensitivity in the explanation, and the proposed management plan prioritizes patient safety, addressing the severity of the condition effectively.
