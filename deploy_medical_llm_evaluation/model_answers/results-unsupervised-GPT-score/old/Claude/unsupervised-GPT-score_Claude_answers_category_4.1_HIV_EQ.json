For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student logically justified the diagnosis by correlating the patient's symptoms with the classic presentation of Lyme disease and differentiating it from acute HIV infection. However, the reasoning could have been slightly more detailed in addressing the cardiac symptoms and their relevance to Lyme disease.

However, the explanation could have been slightly more detailed in clarifying why this combination is suboptimal in terms of resistance and redundancy, which is why a score of 4 was given. For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student logically outlines the steps to manage a newly diagnosed HIV patient who has failed PrEP, including the importance of resistance testing and starting a standard first-line regimen. However, the reasoning could have been more explicit in addressing why resistance testing is critical in this specific context (e.g., the high likelihood of resistance to tenofovir or emtricitabine due to PrEP failure). For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student demonstrates accurate knowledge of first-line regimens and the importance of resistance testing but does not elaborate on alternative regimens if resistance is detected, which slightly limits the depth of their response.
