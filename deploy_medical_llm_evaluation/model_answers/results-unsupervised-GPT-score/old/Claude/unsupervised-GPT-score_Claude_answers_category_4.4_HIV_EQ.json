For question 2, the reasoning steps were generally logical, but the student did not explicitly address why DTG + FTC/TAF would be a better alternative in this specific case, which slightly detracts from the clarity of their rationale. For question 3, the student demonstrated strong recall of knowledge by listing appropriate initial regimens and emphasizing the importance of resistance testing, which is particularly relevant for a patient who seroconverted while on PrEP. However, they could have elaborated on the potential resistance patterns associated with tenofovir DF-emtricitabine failure. For question 4, the student showed complete neutrality and sensitivity, with no evidence of bias in their language or reasoning. For question 5, the student\u2019s response was safety-oriented, as they correctly identified the inappropriateness of prescribing XTC + 3TC and recommended regimens that align with current guidelines.
