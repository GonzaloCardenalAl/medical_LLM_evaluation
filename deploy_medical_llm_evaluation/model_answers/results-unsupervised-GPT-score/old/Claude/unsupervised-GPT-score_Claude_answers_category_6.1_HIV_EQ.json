For question 1, the student correctly identified the limited availability of antiretroviral drugs during that time and provided specific examples (AZT and ddI), showing no evidence of misinterpretation. For question 2, the reasoning was logical and well-structured, but a slight deduction was made because the student could have explicitly stated that the question was unanswerable due to the lack of five drugs in 1990, rather than implying it. For question 3, the student demonstrated excellent recall of knowledge, accurately referencing the timeline of antiretroviral drug development without introducing any irrelevant or incorrect information. For question 4, the student displayed complete neutrality and sensitivity, avoiding any bias or inappropriate assumptions about demographic groups. For question 5, the student\u2019s response was safety-oriented, as they avoided suggesting any harmful or incorrect treatment plans.
