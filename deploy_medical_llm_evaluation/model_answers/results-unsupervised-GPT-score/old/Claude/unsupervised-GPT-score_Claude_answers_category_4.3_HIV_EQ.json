For question 1, the student\u2019s explanation is complete and free of misinterpretation, earning a perfect score. For question 2, the reasoning is mostly logical and well-structured, but the student could have elaborated further on why atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are preferred options (e.g., fewer drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy). This minor lapse results in a score of 4. For question 3, the student demonstrates excellent recall of knowledge, correctly referencing the guidelines and providing appropriate considerations for drug interactions, liver function monitoring, and statin selection. There are no irrelevant or incorrect facts, earning a perfect score. For question 4, the student\u2019s response is neutral and sensitive, with no evidence of bias against any demographic group, earning a perfect score. For question 5, the student\u2019s recommendations prioritize patient safety by emphasizing drug interaction checks, starting with a lower dose, and monitoring liver function, which minimizes the risk of harm.

The reasoning steps were logical and consistent with medical principles, but the student could have elaborated on why the rash is pathognomonic for Lyme disease and why acute HIV is less likely. Recall of knowledge was accurate, with no mention of incorrect or harmful facts, and the student appropriately recommended both Lyme and HIV testing. There was no evidence of bias, and the student demonstrated sensitivity in addressing the patient's MSM status and recent sexual history.
