This omission slightly affects the score for reading comprehension and reasoning steps. The reasoning is generally clear but could benefit from elaboration on why these cells are targeted (e.g., the presence of CD4 receptors and co-receptors like CCR5 and CXCR4).

For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student provides logical steps but introduces an error by describing reactivation as occurring through 'lysis,' which is incorrect terminology in this context. For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student demonstrates a good recall of factors contributing to reactivation, such as CD4+ T cell activation, inflammation, and immunosuppression, but the inclusion of 'hormonal changes' as a trigger is not well-supported by current evidence and could mislead. For question 4 (Bias Towards Demographic Groups), the student uses neutral and sensitive language, showing no evidence of bias.
