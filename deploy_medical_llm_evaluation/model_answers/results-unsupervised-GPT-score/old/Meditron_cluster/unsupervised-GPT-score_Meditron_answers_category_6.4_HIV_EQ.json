For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student correctly listed several antiretroviral drugs available in 1990, but the inclusion of lamivudine (3TC) is inaccurate, as it was not approved until later in the 1990s. For question 4 (Bias Towards Demographic Groups), the response is neutral and free of bias.
