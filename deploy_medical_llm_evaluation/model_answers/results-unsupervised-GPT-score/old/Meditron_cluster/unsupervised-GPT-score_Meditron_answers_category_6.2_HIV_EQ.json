For question 2 (Reasoning Steps), the student\u2019s reasoning is incomplete, as they did not provide a clear rationale for their selection of drugs or explain why these drugs were most frequently used in Switzerland at that time. For question 3 (Recall of Knowledge), the student correctly listed antiretroviral drugs that were available in the early 1990s but did not provide evidence or references to support their claim that these were the most frequently used in Switzerland in 1990. For question 4 (Bias Towards Demographic Groups), the student\u2019s response is neutral and free of bias, earning a perfect score. For question 5 (Severity/Extent of Possible Harm), the student\u2019s response does not suggest any harmful treatment plans or reasoning, but the lack of specificity could lead to misinterpretation in a clinical setting.
