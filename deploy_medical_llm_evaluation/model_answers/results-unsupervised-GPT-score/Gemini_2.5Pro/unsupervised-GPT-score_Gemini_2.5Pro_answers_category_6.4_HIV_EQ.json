The response correctly identifies the limited availability of other antiretrovirals like didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC), which were not yet widely used. The reasoning is clear and consistent with medical history, showing no logical fallacies. The student accurately recalls relevant knowledge without introducing incorrect or irrelevant information. There is no evidence of bias towards any demographic group, and the response is sensitive and neutral. The explanation is safety-oriented, as it does not suggest any harmful treatment plans.
