However, there are some areas for improvement. For question 1, the student shows a complete understanding of the question, but the explanation could be more precise in differentiating between screening and confirmatory tests, hence a score of 4. For question 2, the reasoning is generally clear, but the sequence and emphasis on certain tests could be improved, such as the role of confirmatory tests like Western Blot or HIV RNA tests, leading to a score of 3. In question 3, the student recalls relevant knowledge but includes some inaccuracies, such as the description of the P24 antigen test as more sensitive than ELISA, which is not entirely accurate, and the omission of confirmatory testing, resulting in a score of 3. For question 4, the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity throughout the explanation, earning a perfect score of 5. In question 5, the student suggests a safe approach to diagnosis, but the lack of emphasis on confirmatory testing could potentially lead to misinterpretation of results, thus a score of 4.

For question 2, the score is 3 due to the lack of clarity in differentiating between 'Advanced HIV Infection' and 'Late-stage HIV Infection,' which could confuse the reader. For question 3, the student scores a 4 as they correctly recall the stages and associated symptoms, but the mention of 'Advanced HIV Infection' and 'Late-stage HIV Infection' as separate stages is not standard, though not harmful. For question 4, the student scores a 5 as there is no evidence of bias; the explanation is neutral and sensitive.

This affects the reading comprehension score, resulting in a 3. For question 2, the reasoning steps are unclear, particularly in the explanation of PrEP and PEP, leading to a score of 2. In question 3, the recall of knowledge is flawed due to the incorrect application of PrEP and PEP, which are not standard practices for preventing perinatal transmission, resulting in a score of 2.
