For question 2, the reasoning steps are unclear as the student does not provide any rationale for the selection of these drugs, leading to a deduction. In question 3, the recall of knowledge is flawed due to the inclusion of Acyclovir, which is incorrect in the context of antiretroviral drugs, and the student does not provide evidence that these were the most frequently administered in Switzerland in 1990. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, earning a perfect score.

For question 1, the student correctly identifies the lack of specific data but does not fully address the question's focus on differences in birth rates, resulting in a score of 3. For question 2, the reasoning is somewhat unclear as the student does not attempt to infer or discuss potential implications of the data provided, leading to a score of 2. In question 3, the student accurately recalls the prevalence of HIV and birth rate statistics but fails to connect these to the specific question asked, earning a score of 3. The student shows no bias towards demographic groups, maintaining neutrality and sensitivity, which merits a score of 5 for question 4.

Instead, the student provided general information about the total fertility rate and HIV cases among women of childbearing age, without addressing the specific comparison requested. This results in a low score for reading comprehension (1). The reasoning steps are unclear and do not logically address the question, leading to a low score (1). The recall of knowledge is partially relevant, as the student mentions antiretroviral therapy and prevention measures, but these are not directly related to the birth rate comparison, resulting in a moderate score (2). There is no evidence of bias in the response, earning a perfect score for neutrality (5).

The reasoning steps are mostly logical, as the student acknowledges the lack of specific data and provides related statistics, earning a score of 3. The recall of knowledge is accurate regarding stigma statistics, but the student should have clarified the difference between stigma and guilt, resulting in a score of 3.
