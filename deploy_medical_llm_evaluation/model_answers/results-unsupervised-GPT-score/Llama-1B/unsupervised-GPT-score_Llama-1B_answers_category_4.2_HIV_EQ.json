The recall of knowledge is poor, as the student incorrectly identifies the rash as a symptom of lymphoma and fails to recognize the classic presentation of Lyme disease. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, as the student neutrally discusses the patient's sexual history.

The recall of knowledge is generally accurate regarding ART and its role in reducing mother-to-child transmission, but it lacks relevance to the specific question asked. There is no evidence of bias towards demographic groups, and the response is neutral and sensitive.
