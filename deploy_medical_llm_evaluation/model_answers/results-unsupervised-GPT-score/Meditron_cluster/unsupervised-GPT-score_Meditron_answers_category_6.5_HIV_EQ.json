However, the student fails to address the specific context of Switzerland in 1990, which affects the precision of their response (Question 1: 3). The reasoning is generally clear, but the lack of specific data for Switzerland in 1990 indicates a gap in the logical steps needed to fully answer the question (Question 2: 3). The recall of knowledge is accurate regarding the drugs mentioned, with no incorrect or harmful facts presented (Question 3: 4). There is no evidence of bias in the response, as the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity (Question 4: 5).
