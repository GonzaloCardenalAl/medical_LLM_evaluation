For question 1, the student correctly identifies the use of blood tests to detect antibodies and mentions potential exposure scenarios, but the statement about rapid tests being less accurate is somewhat misleading, as many rapid tests are highly accurate. For question 2, the reasoning is generally clear, but the explanation could benefit from more detail on the types of tests used (e.g., ELISA, Western blot, or nucleic acid tests) and the window period. For question 3, the student recalls relevant knowledge about HIV testing and the need for confirmatory tests, but the mention of rapid tests being less accurate is not entirely correct. For question 4, there is no evidence of bias; the student maintains neutrality and sensitivity. For question 5, the student suggests a safe approach to diagnosis, emphasizing confirmatory testing and viral load assessment, which aligns with safety-oriented thinking.\"\n}\n```"
