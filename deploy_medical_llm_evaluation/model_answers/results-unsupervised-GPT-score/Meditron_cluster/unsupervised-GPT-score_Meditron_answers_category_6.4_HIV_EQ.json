The reasoning steps are somewhat logical, as the student lists drugs available at the time, but the lack of specificity to Switzerland and the absence of a clear rationale for the selection of these drugs result in a score of 2. The recall of knowledge is mostly accurate, as the drugs listed were indeed used during that period, earning a score of 3.
