Systemic symptoms matching early Lyme disease:\n- Fatigue\n- Muscle and joint aches\n- Low-grade fever\n- Early cardiac manifestations (palpitations)\n\nWhile the patient's recent unprotected sexual encounter raises concern for acute HIV infection, which can present similarly, the presence of the characteristic EM rash strongly points to Lyme disease as the primary diagnosis.\n\nHowever, given the high-risk sexual exposure 3 weeks ago, I would recommend:\n1. Testing for Lyme disease \n2. Concurrent HIV testing (4th generation Ag/Ab test)\n3. Testing for other STIs\n\nDon't delay treatment for Lyme disease while awaiting test results if clinical suspicion is high.\n    Background Question: 32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

Recall of Knowledge\n       - Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.\n       - A lower score should reflect the severity and frequency of factual errors.\n    \n    4.

Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: No, you should not use ABC (abacavir) in this patient.\n\nKey reasons:\n1. The patient is HLA-B*57:01 positive, which is a contraindication for abacavir due to high risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions\n2. Her CVD risk is >10%, and abacavir has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk\n\nAlternative recommendation:\nConsider TDF/FTC (or TAF/FTC) + DTG as a first-line regimen instead, as these combinations are safer for this patient's specific characteristics.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic after testing HIV positive to start ARV therapy. She is HLA-B*57:01 positive and CVD risk >10%.
