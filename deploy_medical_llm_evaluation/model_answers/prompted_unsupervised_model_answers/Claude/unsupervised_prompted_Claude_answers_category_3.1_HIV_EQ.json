The key features supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n1. Advanced HIV with low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L) and poor medication adherence\n2. Neurological symptoms: confusion, disorientation, motor weakness, gait issues\n3. Characteristic MRI findings: asymmetric white matter lesions without mass effect\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Subacute progression of symptoms\n\nPML is an opportunistic infection that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients (CD4 < 200). This case illustrates the importance of medication adherence in HIV management. Treatment involves optimizing antiretroviral therapy to achieve immune reconstitution.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Kidney stones from indinavir (requires good hydration)\n2. Bone marrow suppression from zidovudine\n\nNote: This is an older antiretroviral regimen that is no longer first-line therapy in current practice. Modern regimens typically have better safety profiles and are more convenient to take.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

Neurological symptoms (headaches, personality changes, ataxia)\n5. History of poor medication adherence\n6. Single large lesion (>4cm)\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/\u03bcL. The presence of EBV DNA in CSF is highly sensitive and specific for PCNSL in this context. The MRI finding of a single large ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is also characteristic of PCNSL in HIV patients.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

The presentation is typical for community-acquired pneumonia (sudden onset, fever, productive cough, focal infiltrate)\n3. The patient is a smoker, which increases risk for pneumococcal infection\n4. The presentation is classic for bacterial pneumonia with:\n   - Acute onset\n   - Lobar infiltrate\n   - Elevated WBC with neutrophil predominance\n   - Fever and typical respiratory symptoms\n\nEven in HIV patients with good CD4 counts, S. pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, similar to the general population. The well-controlled HIV status makes opportunistic infections less likely in this case.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

Cryptosporidium is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3.\n\n3. The presence of right upper quadrant pain could indicate biliary tract involvement, which is common in Cryptosporidium infection in severely immunocompromised patients.\n\nThe diagnosis can be confirmed with stool microscopy using modified acid-fast staining to identify Cryptosporidium oocysts. The most important intervention would be to restart and maintain antiretroviral therapy, as immune reconstitution is crucial for controlling this infection.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications.

Here's why:\n\nKey supporting findings:\n1. Patient risk factors:\n- HIV positive with CD4 count 240/mm3\n- Lives in homeless shelter\n- History of IV drug use\n- Medication non-compliance\n\n2. Clinical presentation:\n- Chronic symptoms (2 weeks) of fever, cough, night sweats (wet pillow)\n- Weight loss (decreased appetite)\n- Left-sided pleural effusion\n\n3. Pleural fluid analysis is classic for TB:\n- Lymphocyte-predominant\n- High protein\n- Elevated LDH\n- High adenosine deaminase (ADA) - particularly specific for TB\n\n4. Chest X-ray findings:\n- Pleural effusion\n- Hilar lymphadenopathy\n\nThese findings strongly suggest pleural tuberculosis, which is a common manifestation of TB in HIV-positive patients. The high ADA in pleural fluid is particularly specific for tuberculous pleural effusion, especially in high-risk patients.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis includes:\n- Toxoplasmosis (most common CNS opportunistic infection in AIDS)\n- Primary CNS lymphoma\n- HIV-associated stroke\n- Other space-occupying lesions\n\n3. MRI with contrast is the preferred imaging modality because:\n- It can differentiate between various CNS pathologies\n- It's more sensitive than CT for detecting early changes\n- The contrast can help identify characteristic ring-enhancing lesions of toxoplasmosis\n\nAfter imaging, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis may need to be initiated depending on the findings, given the patient's low CD4 count and poor medication adherence.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72.
