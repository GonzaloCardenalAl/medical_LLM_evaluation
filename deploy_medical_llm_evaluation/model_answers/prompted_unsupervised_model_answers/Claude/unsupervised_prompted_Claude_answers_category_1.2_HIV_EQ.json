This transition is triggered by various factors including:\n\n1. Immune system activation (from infections or inflammation)\n2. Cytokine production (particularly TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6)\n3. Epigenetic modifications\n4. Activation of transcription factors (especially NF-\u03baB)\n\nHowever, the exact molecular mechanisms controlling this switch aren't fully understood. We know the viral protein Tat plays a key role in amplifying viral transcription once reactivation begins.\n\nIt's important to note that latent HIV reservoirs persist even during antiretroviral therapy, which is why HIV cannot be cured with current treatments alone.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
