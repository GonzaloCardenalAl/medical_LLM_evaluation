Characteristic MRI findings (asymmetric white matter lesions without mass effect)\n4. Brain biopsy showing demyelination\n5. Subacute progression of symptoms\n\nPML is an opportunistic infection that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised HIV patients. Medication adherence with antiretroviral therapy to improve immune function is crucial for management, along with optimizing her prophylaxis regimen.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Kidney stones from Indinavir (patients need good hydration)\n2. Bone marrow suppression from Zidovudine\n\nNote: This is an older antiretroviral regimen that is no longer commonly used in current practice. Modern HIV treatment typically uses better-tolerated medications.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

Positive EBV DNA in CSF (EBV is strongly associated with PCNSL in HIV patients)\n5. History of medication non-adherence\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. The presence of EBV DNA in the CSF along with the characteristic MRI finding of a single large ring-enhancing lesion, particularly involving the corpus callosum, strongly suggests this diagnosis.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis would require brain biopsy, but the combination of imaging findings and positive EBV PCR in CSF is highly suggestive of PCNSL in this clinical context.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

Community-acquired setting\n4. Risk factors present: smoking history\n5. Lobar pneumonia pattern on chest x-ray\n\nEven in HIV patients with good immune function, S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia, similar to the general population. The patient's preserved CD4 count makes opportunistic infections less likely in this case.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

Here's why:\n\nKey supporting findings:\n1. Patient risk factors:\n- HIV positive with CD4 count of 240 (immunocompromised)\n- Homeless shelter resident (high-risk environment)\n- History of IV drug use\n- Medication non-compliance\n\n2. Clinical presentation:\n- Chronic symptoms (2 weeks) of fever, cough, night sweats (wet pillow)\n- Weight loss (decreased appetite)\n- Left-sided pleural effusion\n\n3. Pleural fluid analysis strongly suggests TB:\n- Lymphocyte-predominant effusion\n- High protein\n- Elevated LDH\n- High adenosine deaminase (ADA) - particularly specific for TB\n\n4. Imaging:\n- Hilar lymphadenopathy\n- Pleural effusion\n\nThe combination of these findings in an immunocompromised patient, especially with high pleural fluid ADA levels, is highly suggestive of tuberculous pleural effusion. The patient should be isolated and started on appropriate anti-tuberculous therapy after confirming the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. Analysis of the pleural fluid shows an effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, an LDH of 500 U/L, and high adenosine deaminase.

Modified acid-fast stain showing oocysts in stool\n5. Young woman with HIV who is non-compliant with therapy\n\nCryptosporidium is a common opportunistic pathogen in HIV patients with CD4 counts below 100, causing chronic, severe diarrhea. The parasite is typically acquired through contaminated water sources, which fits with the patient's history of drinking spring water in Mexico.\n\nThis case represents a severe presentation as evidenced by the patient's:\n- Dehydration (dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, hypotension)\n- Significant weight loss (BMI 16.3)\n- Prolonged symptoms\n\nTreatment should focus on:\n1. Fluid/electrolyte replacement\n2. Initiating antiretroviral therapy\n3. Antimicrobial therapy (typically nitazoxanide)\n    Background Question: A 34-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of diarrhea and abdominal cramping. She has had up to 10 watery stools per day. She also has anorexia and nausea. She returned from a trip to Mexico 4 weeks ago where she went on two hiking trips and often drank from spring water. She was diagnosed with HIV 12 years ago. She says that she has been noncompliant with her therapy. Her last CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 85/mm3. She appears thin. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 16.3 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 85/65 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts.

MRI showing characteristic white matter lesions without enhancement or mass effect\n5. Subacute onset of symptoms\n\nPML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with CD4 counts <200/\u03bcL. The clinical presentation typically includes cognitive dysfunction, motor deficits, and visual changes, which progress over weeks to months.\n\nWhile the positive Toxoplasma IgG is noted, the MRI findings are not consistent with toxoplasmosis, which typically shows ring-enhancing lesions with mass effect. The negative cryptococcal antigen also helps rule out cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nTreatment should focus on immediate reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy, though the patient should be monitored for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

The presentation of focal neurological deficits with fever in this setting is classic.\n\nWhile a CT head could be considered, MRI with contrast is more sensitive for detecting toxoplasmosis lesions and other HIV-associated CNS pathologies (like CNS lymphoma, which is an important differential diagnosis).\n\nAfter imaging, empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis should be strongly considered if consistent lesions are found, along with restarting antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen.

His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.
