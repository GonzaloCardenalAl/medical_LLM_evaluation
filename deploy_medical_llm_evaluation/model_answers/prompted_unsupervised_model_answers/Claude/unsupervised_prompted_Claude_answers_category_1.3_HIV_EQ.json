Confirmatory Testing:\n- Western blot or \n- HIV RNA test (viral load)\n\nFor a definitive diagnosis, positive screening tests must be confirmed with follow-up testing. The window period (time from infection to detectable virus) varies by test type:\n- 4th gen test: 2-6 weeks\n- Antibody-only tests: 3-12 weeks\n\nIt's important to note that all positive HIV diagnoses should be confirmed with a second test before informing the patient, to avoid false positives.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

This transition is triggered by various factors including:\n\n1. Cellular activation signals (like cytokines and transcription factors)\n2. Epigenetic modifications\n3. Environmental stressors\n\nThe exact molecular mechanisms aren't fully understood, but we know that the viral transcription factor Tat and the cellular NF-\u03baB pathway play key roles. When activated, these pathways lead to increased viral gene expression and production of new viral particles.\n\nThis latency-to-active switch is a major challenge in HIV treatment, as it makes complete viral eradication difficult even with antiretroviral therapy.\n\nI should note that while we understand some key elements, there are still many aspects of this switch mechanism that remain under investigation by researchers.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
