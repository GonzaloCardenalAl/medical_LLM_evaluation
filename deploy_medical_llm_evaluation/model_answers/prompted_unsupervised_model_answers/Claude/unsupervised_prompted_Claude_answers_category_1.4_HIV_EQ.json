These factors bind to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, initiating viral transcription.\n\nKey triggers for reactivation can include:\n- Immune system activation (from infections or inflammation)\n- Certain cytokines\n- Epigenetic changes\n- Cellular stress\n\nHowever, the exact mechanisms controlling this switch aren't fully understood, which is one reason why achieving HIV cure remains challenging - we can't reliably control or predict viral reactivation from latent reservoirs.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
