This transition is triggered by various factors including:\n\n1. Immune system activation (through infections or inflammation)\n2. Cytokine production (especially TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2)\n3. Epigenetic modifications\n4. Activation of transcription factors (particularly NF-\u03baB)\n\nThe exact molecular mechanisms aren't fully understood, but we know the virus remains dormant in cellular reservoirs during latency and can reactivate when conditions become favorable. This process is one of the main challenges in HIV cure research, as latent reservoirs make it impossible to completely eliminate the virus with current treatments.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
