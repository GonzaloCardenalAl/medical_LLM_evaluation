Disruption of cellular factors that maintain viral latency\n\nThe exact molecular mechanisms aren't fully understood, but we know that the viral protein Tat plays a crucial role in amplifying viral gene expression once reactivation begins.\n\nThis switch is clinically important because it's why HIV can't be cured with current antiretroviral therapy alone - the latent reservoir can reactivate even after years of successful treatment.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
