Location in corpus callosum\n5. Subacute neurological symptoms (headaches, confusion, ataxia)\n\nPCNSL is an AIDS-defining illness that typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. Nearly all cases of AIDS-related PCNSL are associated with EBV infection. The MRI findings are characteristic, showing a solitary or few lesions with weak enhancement, unlike the strong ring enhancement seen in toxoplasmosis, which would be the main differential diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/\u03bcL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum.

Its mechanism of action involves:\n\n1. Trimethoprim: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\n2. Sulfamethoxazole: Competitively inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, preventing the formation of dihydrofolic acid\n\nTogether, these actions create a sequential blockade in the folate synthesis pathway, ultimately preventing bacterial DNA and RNA synthesis. This dual mechanism makes TMP-SMX particularly effective against Nocardia species.\n    Background Question: A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process.

Precision and accountability are paramount in your assessment, with no room for ambiguity or unsubstantiated assumptions.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria \n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions. Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

Maternal HIV antibodies cross the placenta and persist in the infant for up to 18 months, making antibody tests unreliable\n2. HIV DNA PCR can directly detect the presence of viral genetic material\n3. The test should be performed at:\n   - 14-21 days of age\n   - 1-2 months of age\n   - 4-6 months of age\n\nTwo negative PCR tests (one after 1 month and another after 4 months) are typically required to confidently rule out HIV infection in an exposed infant.\n    Background Question: A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery.

Strongly counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife due to her risk of exposure\n2. Inform him that while patient confidentiality is important, state laws require reporting of HIV cases to public health authorities\n3. Explain that partner notification services through the health department can help notify the wife anonymously\n4. Cannot breach confidentiality and directly tell the wife without the patient's consent, as this would violate HIPAA\n\nThe physician should document all counseling efforts and referrals to partner notification services. If the patient continues to refuse disclosure, the physician can utilize public health authorities who have procedures in place for anonymous partner notification while maintaining the source patient's confidentiality.\n\nThe key is balancing the ethical duty to protect public health with legal requirements for patient confidentiality.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient.

The patient is on HIV medications (though unable to recall names)\n2. Several antiretroviral medications, particularly didanosine, stavudine, and less commonly others, can cause pancreatitis\n3. The timing (6 months after HIV diagnosis and presumed ART initiation) is consistent\n4. CT shows no gallstones (ruling out gallstone pancreatitis)\n5. While the patient reports moderate alcohol use, there's no indication of heavy alcohol consumption that would typically cause alcoholic pancreatitis\n\nThe next steps would include:\n1. Reviewing her specific ART regimen\n2. Possibly modifying her HIV medication regimen\n3. Providing appropriate supportive care for acute pancreatitis\n\nThis case requires collaboration with her HIV specialist to optimize her ART regimen while managing the acute pancreatitis.\n    Background Question: A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder.

It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that acts as a DNA chain terminator, preventing HIV from converting its RNA into DNA. This interrupts viral replication at an early stage, reducing the maternal viral load and decreasing the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to the newborn.\n    Background Question:  A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown.
