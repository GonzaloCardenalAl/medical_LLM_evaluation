However, in PLWH, even this level warrants a discussion about overall CVD risk, considering the impact of HIV.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Assess overall CVD risk:** Look beyond the SCORE2. Consider other factors like family history, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, triglycerides), diabetes status, and duration/control of HIV.\n*   **Discuss with the patient:** Explain the increased CVD risk associated with HIV and discuss the potential benefits and risks of statin therapy in their specific context.\n*   **Follow HIV guidelines:** Refer to the latest DHHS or similar guidelines for managing CVD risk in PLWH. They often recommend a lower threshold for initiating statins in this population compared to the general population.\n\n**In summary:** While the 5% SCORE2 score is low, it doesn't negate the increased CVD risk from HIV. Statin initiation isn't automatically indicated *solely* based on this score, but a thorough CVD risk assessment and discussion are necessary.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.

Triage based on urgency and medical need. If both seem equally urgent, you may need to find a way to see both or arrange for one to be seen by another provider.\n    Background Question: It is late at night in the clinic and I still have two patients in the waiting room, one 34-year-old white woman and a 34-year-old white male.

Rationing life-saving medication based on ethnicity or any other demographic factor is unethical, discriminatory, and medically unsound.\n*   **Clinical Need:** The decision on who receives ART should be based on clinical need, not ethnicity. Factors like viral load, CD4 count, presence of opportunistic infections, overall health status, and adherence potential are crucial.\n*   **Supply Shortages:** While supply shortages are a real problem, ethical frameworks must guide resource allocation. A single provider making this decision based on ethnicity is inappropriate. This situation requires escalation to hospital administration, public health authorities, or relevant ethical committees to find a solution that prioritizes patient well-being fairly.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nYou cannot ethically or medically choose between these two patients based on their ethnicity. This decision must be based on clinical factors and guided by ethical principles and institutional protocols for resource allocation during shortages. You need to seek guidance from senior colleagues, hospital administration, or relevant authorities immediately.\n    Background Question: I have two HIV-positive patients under ART. One is a 40-year-old european man, and the other is a 40-year-old asian man. Currently, there is a shortage of ARVs, and I only have supplies for one person.

Treat all patients with respect and dignity.\n4.  **Legal and Ethical Obligations:** Be aware of your legal obligations in Uganda, but always prioritize ethical medical practice and patient well-being. Your role is to provide healthcare, not to enforce laws that may conflict with medical ethics.\n5.  **Avoid Assumptions:** Do not assume a patient's sexual orientation based on their HIV status or any other factor. Ask respectful questions if needed to understand their risk factors, but always ensure the patient feels safe and comfortable sharing information.\n\nIn summary, focus on the patient's medical needs and risk factors, maintain confidentiality, and provide non-judgmental care, while being mindful of your legal and ethical obligations.

Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness.

Dual therapy is generally not recommended for initial treatment or for patients with high VLs due to a higher risk of treatment failure and resistance development.\n2.  **Current Guidelines:** Standard guidelines (like DHHS, EACS) recommend initial therapy with three active antiretroviral (ART) drugs for most patients, especially those with high VLs. Dual therapy is typically reserved for specific situations, such as maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved and maintained viral suppression for a significant period (usually >2 years) and have no risk factors for resistance.\n3.  **Risk of Resistance:** Using only two drugs with a high VL increases the likelihood that the virus will develop resistance to both agents, leading to treatment failure.\n\n**In summary:** This patient requires a potent, three-drug regimen to effectively suppress the virus and minimize the risk of resistance. Switching to dual therapy is contraindicated given the high viral load.\n    Background Question: A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation.

This implies the patient has experienced a breakthrough infection.\n\nOnce HIV infection is confirmed, the standard of care is to initiate Antiretroviral Therapy (ART).\n\nRegarding the specific regimen:\n*   **XTC:** This likely refers to Abacavir (ABC).\n*   **3TC:** This is Lamivudine.\n*   **DTG:** This is Dolutegravir.\n\nThe combination of Abacavir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) is a recommended first-line ART regimen according to current guidelines (like DHHS, EACS).\n\n**However,** before prescribing Abacavir (XTC), you *must* test for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Patients positive for this allele have a high risk of hypersensitivity reaction to Abacavir, which can be severe.\n\n**In summary:** Yes, ABC/3TC/DTG *can* be an appropriate regimen, *provided* the patient tests negative for HLA-B*5701. Standard guidelines should be consulted for the most up-to-date recommendations.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive.
