Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), which involves combinations of drugs, wasn't available yet. Treatment primarily focused on one or two drugs, often targeting reverse transcriptase.\n\nThe most frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland around 1990 were likely:\n\n1.  **Zidovudine (AZT)**: This was the first approved drug and the cornerstone of therapy.\n2.  **Didanosine (ddI)**: Often used in combination with AZT or as an alternative.\n3.  **Lamivudine (3TC)**: Gained approval around that time and started being used.\n4.  **Stavudine (d4T)**: Another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that became available.\n5.  **Foscarnet**: Primarily used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, but also had some activity against HIV, especially in cases resistant to other drugs.\n\nIt's important to remember that these drugs had significant side effects and limited effectiveness compared to modern therapies. Treatment strategies were still evolving rapidly during this period.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

In 2020, the birth rate among women living with HIV in Switzerland was lower than that of women without HIV.\n\nThis is likely due to several factors, including:\n\n*   **Later age at first birth:** Women living with HIV tend to have their first child later in life.\n*   **Reduced fertility:** HIV infection can affect fertility.\n*   **Desire to avoid transmission:** Some women living with HIV may choose to delay or avoid pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission.\n*   **Access to effective treatment:** Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved the health and life expectancy of women living with HIV, allowing them to plan for pregnancy more safely.\n\nIt's important to note that with appropriate medical care and HAART, women living with HIV can have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. The risk of mother-to-child transmission is very low (less than 1%) when women receive effective treatment during pregnancy.\n\n**Reference:**\n*   Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).

Studies often look at adherence over longer periods (e.g., 6 months, 1 year) or use different metrics (e.g., pill counts, pharmacy refills, viral load).\n*   **Self-Reporting Bias:** Self-reported adherence is known to be often *overestimated*. People may not accurately recall or may feel uncomfortable admitting missed doses.\n*   **Variability:** Adherence rates can vary significantly depending on the patient population (e.g., newly diagnosed vs. long-term patients, different socio-economic groups, co-morbidities) and the specific clinic or region within Switzerland.\n\n**What we *can* say based on general knowledge and Swiss HIV studies:**\n\n*   Studies in Switzerland, like elsewhere, show that a significant proportion of patients *do* report missing doses occasionally.\n*   While exact percentages fluctuate, estimates often suggest that a substantial minority (perhaps 10-30% or more, depending on the study and definition) might report missing *some* doses within a given month, even if they are generally adherent over the long term.\n*   However, translating this into a precise proportion of *visits* where a patient reports missing *at least one dose* in the *previous month* is complex and requires specific data analysis that isn't typically published in this exact format.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nI cannot give you a precise, universally accepted percentage for Switzerland based on self-reported monthly missed doses. The data is complex, variable, and often relies on potentially biased self-reporting. It's best to consult specific Swiss HIV cohort studies or national surveillance reports for more detailed, context-specific information.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, based on self-reported treatment adherence, what proportion of visits involve patients who have missed taking their treatment at least once per month?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

I don't have that exact statistic readily available.\n\nHowever, I can share some general context:\n\n*   **Historically:** A significant proportion of HIV-related deaths occurred in individuals infected earlier in life, often during adolescence or young adulthood.\n*   **Current Trends:** With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and earlier diagnosis, the age at diagnosis and the proportion dying from HIV-related causes have shifted. Deaths are now more common in older individuals, some diagnosed later in life.\n*   **Swiss Context:** Switzerland has a strong HIV surveillance system (Swiss HIV Cohort Study). You might find this specific data by consulting their publications or reports.\n\nTo get the precise proportion you're asking for, I'd recommend checking the latest reports from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) or the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Other factors like viral load, genetics, co-infections, and adherence to treatment are much more significant determinants of CD4 count decline.\n\nIt's important to note that this cohort experienced a significant shift in HIV management during that period (1990-2010), with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically altering the natural history of the disease. Therefore, comparing progression rates across this entire timeframe requires careful consideration of when individuals started treatment.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
