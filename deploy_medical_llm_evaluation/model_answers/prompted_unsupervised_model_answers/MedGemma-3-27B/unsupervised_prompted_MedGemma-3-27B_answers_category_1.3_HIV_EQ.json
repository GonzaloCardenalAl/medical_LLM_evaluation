Examples include rapid tests (finger prick or oral fluid) and laboratory-based tests (blood draw).\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These look for both HIV antibodies and a specific HIV antigen called p24. Antigen/antibody tests can detect HIV infection earlier than antibody-only tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look for the virus itself in the blood. NATs are typically used when there's a high suspicion of recent infection or to confirm positive results from other tests.\n\nOften, a rapid antibody test is done first. If positive, it's confirmed with a more specific lab test like an antigen/antibody test or a NAT.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

It's generally categorized into three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2-4 weeks after infection. Symptoms can be flu-like (fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers). Viral load is very high, making transmission risk high.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** The virus is still active but reproduces at low levels. People may not have symptoms or only mild ones. Without treatment, this stage can last for many years (average 10 years), but the virus gradually weakens the immune system. Viral load is lower than in the acute stage, but transmission is still possible.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when the immune system is badly damaged, typically when the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or when certain opportunistic infections or cancers develop. Symptoms are severe and include rapid weight loss, recurring fever, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, chronic diarrhea, fatigue, sores of the mouth, throat, and genitals, pneumonia, neurological disorders, and certain cancers.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV can stay in the chronic stage for decades and never progress to AIDS. ART can also reduce the viral load to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

The mother should be on effective ART throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and ideally continue it long-term for her own health. The goal is to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load.\n2.  **Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for the Infant:** The newborn receives HIV medication for a period after birth (usually 4-6 weeks, sometimes longer depending on risk factors).\n3.  **Mode of Delivery:** Cesarean section (C-section) is often recommended if the mother's viral load is not suppressed near delivery, to reduce the infant's exposure during birth. Vaginal delivery is generally safe if the viral load is undetectable.\n4.  **Infant Feeding:** In settings where safe alternatives are available, formula feeding is recommended to eliminate the risk of transmission through breast milk. If breastfeeding is necessary or chosen, the mother must be on effective ART with viral suppression, and the infant should receive prophylaxis.\n5.  **Early Diagnosis and Treatment of HIV in the Infant:** Testing the infant for HIV early and starting treatment immediately if positive is crucial.\n\nThese combined strategies have dramatically reduced MTCT rates.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

This is called the latent reservoir. In this state, the virus isn't actively replicating and isn't targeted by the immune system or antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n2.  **Active Infection:** This is when the virus is actively replicating, producing new virions, and causing immune system damage. This is the state targeted by ART.\n3.  **The \"Switch\" (Viral Reactivation):** This is the process where latent HIV becomes active again. It's not a simple on/off switch, but rather a complex process.\n\n**What triggers reactivation?**\n\n*   **Immune Activation:** Strong immune stimulation (e.g., from other infections, inflammation, certain cancers) is a major trigger. When immune cells become activated, the latent virus can also be activated.\n*   **Cytokines:** Specific signaling molecules (cytokines) like IL-15, TNF-alpha, and IL-7 can stimulate HIV reactivation.\n*   **Cellular Factors:** Certain cellular processes and transcription factors within the infected cell can influence reactivation.\n*   **ART Interruption:** Stopping ART allows the virus to replicate freely, but it can also potentially lead to reactivation of latent virus.\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n*   **Viral Persistence:** The latent reservoir is the main barrier to curing HIV. Even with effective ART suppressing active replication, the latent virus remains.\n*   **Rebound:** If ART is stopped, the reactivated latent virus can quickly lead to a rapid increase in viral load and disease progression.\n*   **Therapeutic Target:** Understanding the reactivation process is crucial for developing strategies (like \"shock and kill\") aimed at eliminating the latent reservoir.\n\n**In short:** Reactivation occurs when stimuli (often immune-related) cause the latent virus within resting cells to start replicating again. This process is complex and involves multiple cellular and molecular factors. It's a major hurdle in achieving an HIV cure.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
