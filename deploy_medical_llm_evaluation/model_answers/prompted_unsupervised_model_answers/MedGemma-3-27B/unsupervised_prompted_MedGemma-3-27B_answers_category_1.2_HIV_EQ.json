They can detect HIV earlier than antibody-only tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look for the virus's genetic material (RNA). They are the most expensive and usually reserved for specific situations, like confirming positive results or diagnosing acute infection.\n\nInitial screening often uses an antibody or antigen/antibody test. If positive, confirmatory tests (like a different type of antibody test or a NAT) are performed.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

It's typically described in three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. The virus is multiplying rapidly, and the immune system is starting to respond. Many people experience flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers). Viral load is very high during this stage, making transmission risk high.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** This stage can last for many years (a decade or more without treatment). The virus is still active but reproduces at low levels. People may not have any symptoms, or only mild ones. However, the virus is still damaging the immune system. With treatment (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades and may never progress to AIDS.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when the immune system is badly damaged, usually indicated by a very low CD4 cell count (less than 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the development of certain opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\n\nIt's important to remember that with early diagnosis and consistent antiretroviral therapy (ART), most people with HIV can live long, healthy lives and never reach the AIDS stage.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

HIV prevention involves several strategies:\n\n1.  **Condom Use:** Consistent and correct use of latex or polyurethane condoms significantly reduces the risk of transmission during sexual activity.\n2.  **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Taking a daily medication (like Truvada or Descovy) can prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at high risk.\n3.  **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Taking antiretroviral medications soon after a potential exposure (within 72 hours) can prevent HIV infection.\n4.  **Testing and Treatment:** Regular HIV testing allows for early diagnosis. Treating HIV effectively with antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the viral load, often to undetectable levels, making transmission extremely unlikely (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).\n5.  **Harm Reduction for Injection Drug Users:** Using sterile needles and syringes and not sharing injection equipment prevents HIV transmission. Needle exchange programs can help.\n6.  **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):** HIV-positive pregnant individuals taking ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their baby.\n\nThese are the main, evidence-based methods.

This significantly reduces the viral load, making transmission much less likely.\n2.  **Infant Prophylaxis:** The newborn receives antiretroviral medication for several weeks after birth.\n3.  **Delivery Method:** Cesarean section (C-section) may be recommended if the mother's viral load is high near delivery, though ART is the primary factor. Vaginal delivery is generally safe if the viral load is undetectable.\n4.  **Feeding:** Avoid breastfeeding in settings where safe alternatives are available.

It's not actively replicating.\n*   **Active Infection:** The virus is replicating, producing new virions, and causing damage to the immune system.\n\n**The \"Switch\" Process:**\n\n1.  **Activation Signal:** Something triggers the resting CD4+ T cell where latent HIV resides. This could be:\n    *   Immune activation (e.g., response to another infection, inflammation).\n    *   Cytokines (signaling molecules released by immune cells).\n    *   Certain drugs (though this is less common clinically, it's relevant in research).\n2.  **Viral Reactivation:** The activation signal tells the cell to \"wake up.\" This includes turning on the HIV genes that were previously silenced.\n3.  **Viral Replication:** The activated cell starts producing HIV RNA and proteins.\n4.  **Virion Production & Spread:** New virus particles (virions) are assembled and released from the cell, ready to infect other CD4+ T cells.\n5.  **Immune Response & Cell Death:** The newly active infection triggers an immune response. Often, the infected cell is eventually killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\n**In essence:** It's a process of cellular activation leading to viral gene expression, replication, and ultimately, the production of new infectious virus. This reactivation is a major barrier to curing HIV, as these latent reservoirs can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
