They can be done via blood draw or oral fluid. Rapid antibody tests provide results in about 30 minutes.\n2.  **Antigen/Antibody Tests (4th Generation Tests):** These look for both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen (a part of the virus itself). They can detect HIV earlier than antibody-only tests. These are usually done via blood draw.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT):** These look for the actual virus's genetic material (RNA) in the blood. They are the most expensive and usually reserved for specific situations, like confirming positive results from other tests or diagnosing acute HIV infection.\n\nA positive result on an initial screening test is always confirmed with a second, different type of test.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

It's typically described in three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring within 2-4 weeks after infection. The virus is multiplying rapidly, and the immune system is trying to fight it off. Many people experience flu-like symptoms (fever, rash, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes), but some have no symptoms. Viral load is very high during this stage, making transmission risk high.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** The virus is still active but reproduces at lower levels. People may not have symptoms for many years, but the virus continues to damage the immune system. Without treatment, this stage can last for a decade or more, but eventually progresses to AIDS. With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people can stay in this stage for many years, potentially for life, with a very low or undetectable viral load.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when the immune system is badly damaged, typically when the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or when certain opportunistic infections or cancers develop. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\n\nIt's important to remember that with early diagnosis and consistent ART, many people with HIV never progress to AIDS and can live long, healthy lives.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

When undetectable, they have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner (Undetectable = Untransmittable, or U=U).\n5.  **Avoiding Sharing Needles/Syringes:** Never share injection equipment (needles, syringes, cookers, cotton, water). Use sterile equipment every time.\n6.  **Testing and Counseling:** Regular HIV testing helps people know their status. Counseling provides information on risk reduction.\n7.  **Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC):** Circumcision can reduce the risk of female-to-male sexual transmission in high-prevalence areas.\n8.  **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):** HIV-positive pregnant people taking ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their baby.\n\nThese are the main evidence-based methods.

It's a multi-pronged approach.\n\n1.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for the Mother:** This is the most crucial step. Starting ART as early as possible during pregnancy and continuing it throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery dramatically reduces the viral load, minimizing the risk of transmission. The goal is to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load.\n2.  **Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for the Infant:** The newborn receives ART for a specific period (usually 4-6 weeks) after birth to prevent infection if any virus was transmitted during delivery.\n3.  **Mode of Delivery:** Cesarean section (C-section) before labor begins and before rupture of membranes is recommended for mothers with a detectable viral load near the time of delivery. Vaginal delivery is generally safe if the mother has an undetectable viral load.\n4.  **Infant Feeding:** In resource-rich settings where safe alternatives are available, formula feeding is recommended to eliminate the risk of transmission through breast milk. In resource-limited settings, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks if the mother is on effective ART with viral suppression.\n\nThese interventions, when implemented together, reduce the risk of perinatal transmission to less than 1%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

It's not actively replicating or causing damage. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress active virus but *cannot* eliminate the latent reservoir.\n*   **Active Infection:** The virus is actively replicating, destroying CD4+ T cells, and causing disease progression if untreated.\n\n**The \"Switch\" (Viral Reactivation):**\n\n*   **What it is:** The process where latent HIV \"wakes up\" and starts replicating again.\n*   **Triggers:** Various factors can trigger reactivation, including:\n    *   Immune stimulation (e.g., other infections, inflammation)\n    *   Certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids)\n    *   Stress\n    *   Changes in immune status (e.g., stopping ART)\n*   **Mechanism:** The exact molecular mechanisms are complex and still being researched, but involve signaling pathways within the host cell that alter the expression of viral genes, allowing transcription and replication to begin.\n*   **Clinical Significance:** Reactivation can lead to:\n    *   Increased viral load\n    *   Decline in CD4+ T cell count\n    *   Increased risk of HIV-related complications\n    *   Potential for disease progression if ART is stopped or ineffective.\n\n**In Summary:** The switch is viral reactivation, triggered by various stimuli, where dormant HIV begins replicating again. This is a major hurdle in achieving a complete cure for HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
