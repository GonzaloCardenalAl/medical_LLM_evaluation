Symptoms are non-specific and may include fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Chronic HIV Infection**: After the initial infection, the virus replicates and attacks the body's immune system, leading to a decline in CD4 cells (a type of T-cell). This stage is characterized by a decrease in CD4 cell count and an increase in the number of HIV-infected cells.\n\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)**: The CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. This is the stage where the immune system is severely compromised, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases.\n\n4. **Advanced HIV Infection**: The CD4 cell count is below 100 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, and the immune system is severely weakened. This stage is characterized by increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and cancers.\n\n5. **Late-stage HIV Infection**: At this stage, the immune system is severely compromised, and the individual is highly susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers. This stage is often associated with a high risk of death.\n\nIt's essential to note that the progression from one stage to the next can vary significantly among individuals, and the exact timeline can be influenced by factors such as the individual's health, treatment, and lifestyle.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

PrEP is recommended for women who are HIV-positive and have a viral load below 50 copies per milliliter of blood.\n\n2. **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**: Administering antiretroviral medication to the partner of an HIV-positive woman within 72 hours of exposure can also reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n3. **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for partners of HIV-positive women**: If the HIV-positive partner has not yet started ART, PrEP can help reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n4. **Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV**: This typically involves antiretroviral therapy for the mother during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis for the baby.\n\n5. **HIV testing and counseling**: Ensuring that both partners are tested and counseled about the risks and benefits of HIV testing and treatment can also help reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n6. **Preventive care**: Regular prenatal care and testing for both the mother and baby can help identify any potential issues early, allowing for timely treatment and reducing the risk of transmission.\n\nIt is essential to note that while these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission, they are not 100% effective.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

When HIV infects these cells, it weakens the immune system and makes it harder for the body to fight off infections and diseases.\n\nAIDS, on the other hand, is a condition that occurs when HIV has progressed to the point where the virus has severely damaged the immune system, making it impossible for the body to fight off infections and diseases. At this stage, the body is highly susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers.\n\nIn other words, HIV is a precursor to AIDS, but not all people with HIV will develop AIDS.\n    Background Question: What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Here's a brief overview:\n\n**Latent HIV:**\n\n* In a latent state, the virus is not actively replicating, but the immune system is still aware of its presence.\n* The virus is contained in the body, usually in the lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus.\n* The immune system has developed mechanisms to suppress the virus, preventing it from replicating and causing disease.\n* Latent HIV is not infectious, but it can still be detected through viral load tests.\n\n**Active Infection:**\n\n* In an active infection, the virus is actively replicating, causing inflammation and damage to the body.\n* The immune system is actively responding to the virus, and the body's defenses are compromised.\n* The virus is infectious, and transmission can occur through bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.\n\n**Transition from Latent to Active:**\n\n* The switch from latent to active HIV occurs when the immune system is unable to suppress the virus, often due to factors such as:\n\t+ Aging\n\t+ High viral load\n\t+ Immunosuppression (e.g., due to HIV treatment or HIV/AIDS)\n\t+ Certain medications (e.g., antiretroviral therapy)\n\t+ Viral mutations\n* The immune system may become exhausted, leading to a decline in its ability to suppress the virus.\n\nIt's essential to note that the transition from latent to active HIV is not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that can take years to develop. Early detection and treatment can help prevent further progression to active infection and reduce the risk of transmission.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
