There are two types of tests:\n\n1.  **Rapid tests**: These are point-of-care tests that provide quick results, usually within 20-30 minutes. They detect antibodies or antigens (substances produced by the virus) in the blood.\n2.  **Serum tests**: These are laboratory tests that analyze blood samples for antibodies or antigens. They are more sensitive and specific than rapid tests.\n3.  **Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**: These tests detect the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of the virus in the blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. They are highly sensitive and specific.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a two-step testing approach:\n\n1.  **Screening**: A rapid or serum test to detect HIV antibodies or antigens.\n2.  **Confirmation**: A second test, usually a NAT or a more specific antibody test, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA positive result on any of these tests indicates HIV infection. A negative result does not rule out HIV, especially if the test was done early after exposure.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

During this stage, the virus replicates rapidly, and the person may experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Clinical latency (also known as chronic HIV infection)**: This stage can last for many years, even decades, if left untreated. During this stage, the virus continues to replicate at a slower rate, and the person may not show any symptoms. However, the virus is still present in the body and can be transmitted to others.\n\n3. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: This is the final stage of HIV infection, which occurs when the immune system is severely weakened due to prolonged HIV infection. AIDS is characterized by the presence of certain opportunistic infections or cancers, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or Kaposi's sarcoma.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Chronic kidney disease: HIV itself and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can affect kidney function.\n3. Liver disease: Hepatitis B and C co-infections are common, and HIV can also cause liver damage.\n4. Neurological disorders: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), peripheral neuropathy, and seizures.\n5. Osteoporosis: Weakened bones due to HIV and ART.\n6. Mental health disorders: Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders are more prevalent.\n7. Cancer: Increased risk of non-AIDS-defining cancers, such as lung, liver, and anal cancer.\n8. Diabetes: Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are common due to HIV and ART.\n9. Bone marrow suppression: Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia can occur due to HIV or ART.\n10.

This reduces the risk of transmission to less than 1%.\n3. **Elective cesarean delivery**: Women with a high viral load (>1000 copies/mL) or those with a history of previous perinatal transmission may benefit from an elective cesarean delivery before the onset of labor and before the rupture of membranes.\n4. **Avoid breastfeeding**: Exclusive formula feeding is recommended to prevent postnatal transmission through breast milk.\n5. **Antiretroviral prophylaxis**: The mother should receive antiretroviral prophylaxis during labor, typically with a combination of zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC).\n6. **Neonatal prophylaxis**: The newborn should receive zidovudine (AZT) within 6 hours of birth and for 6 weeks to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission.\n\nThese measures significantly reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, making it possible for HIV-positive women to have healthy, HIV-negative children.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

However, the immune system can't eliminate the virus entirely. \n\nReactivation is often triggered by immune system suppression, such as during untreated HIV infection or when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is stopped. Additionally, other factors like inflammation, immune activation, and certain co-infections can also contribute to reactivation.\n\nWhen the virus reactivates, it can lead to a resurgence of viral replication, resulting in detectable viremia and potentially, a decrease in CD4 T-cell counts.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
