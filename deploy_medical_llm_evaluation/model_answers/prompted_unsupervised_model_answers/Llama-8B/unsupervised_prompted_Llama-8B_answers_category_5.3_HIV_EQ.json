PML is a rare but serious complication of HIV infection, often occurring in individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with low CD4 counts (less than 100 cells/\u00b5L). The patient's CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms of disorientation, confusion, and diplopia, as well as the motor weakness, are consistent with the neurological manifestations of PML. The fact that you recently diagnosed a patient with HAND suggests that this patient's condition may be related to the same underlying cause.\n\nIt is essential to note that PML is a medical emergency, and prompt initiation of ART and supportive care are crucial to manage the condition and prevent further progression.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).

Since indinavir is a protease inhibitor, which is a class of medications that can cause pancreatitis, the patient is at increased risk for this side effect.\n2. **Diarrhea**: Lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea.\n3. **Nausea and vomiting**: Similar to diarrhea, these medications can also cause gastrointestinal upset.\n4. **Hyperbilirubinemia**: Indinavir can cause elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which can lead to jaundice.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient closely for these potential side effects and adjust the treatment regimen as needed to minimize the risk of adverse effects.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

The key points that support this diagnosis are:\n\n1.  The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and low CD4 count (90/\u03bcL).\n2.  The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI, which is a characteristic feature of PCNSL.\n3.  The PCR-positive result for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is often associated with PCNSL.\n4.  The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain.\n\nGlioblastoma is typically seen in immunocompetent individuals and is less likely in this context. A definitive diagnosis would require a biopsy of the brain lesion.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma.

The presence of a pleural effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, and high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in the pleural fluid are consistent with a lymphomatous process. The patient's symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and left-sided chest pain, are also consistent with lymphoma.\n\nThe patient's history of smoking and intravenous drug use may also contribute to his risk of developing lung cancer, but the presence of a lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion and high ADA levels make lymphoma a more likely diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest.

The presence of oocysts on a modified acid-fast stain in the stool sample is a key diagnostic clue. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite that causes cyclosporiasis, which typically presents with watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weight loss, and malabsorption. The patient's recent travel to Mexico, consumption of untreated spring water, and non-compliance with HIV therapy increase the likelihood of a waterborne parasitic infection.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Entamoeba histolytica can cause similar symptoms, the presence of oocysts on a modified acid-fast stain is more characteristic of Cyclospora cayetanensis. Additionally, the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count make them more susceptible to opportunistic infections like Cyclospora.\n    Background Question: A 34-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of diarrhea and abdominal cramping. She has had up to 10 watery stools per day. She also has anorexia and nausea. She returned from a trip to Mexico 4 weeks ago where she went on two hiking trips and often drank from spring water. She was diagnosed with HIV 12 years ago. She says that she has been noncompliant with her therapy. Her last CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 85/mm3. She appears thin. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 16.3 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 85/65 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Entamoeba histolytica.

The formula for NPV is:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)\n\nFrom the data provided, we know the number of false positives (5) but not the number of true negatives. However, we can calculate the true negatives by subtracting the number of false positives from the total number of controls (250):\n\nTrue Negatives = Total Controls - False Positives\n= 250 - 5\n= 245\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)\n= 245 / (245 + 5)\n= 245 / 250\n= 0.98 or 98%\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is 98%.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination.

The presence of severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL and high HIV viral load) and disseminated white matter lesions on MRI are consistent with HAD. \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and behavioral changes, are also consistent with HAD. While vascular dementia is a possibility, the patient's age and the presence of non-enhancing white matter lesions on MRI make HAD a more likely diagnosis.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity is not directly relevant to the current presentation, as it is likely a latent infection.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

The patient's low CD4 count and altered mental status increase the risk of complications from LP, such as herniation.\n\nThe most appropriate next step would be to stabilize the patient with oxygen therapy, IV fluids, and antipyretics, and to obtain a non-invasive imaging study, such as a head CT scan, to rule out other causes of his symptoms and assess for signs of increased intracranial pressure. If the CT scan is normal or does not show signs of increased intracranial pressure, then a lumbar puncture can be performed under close monitoring.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion. He is a cachectic man in acute distress, unable to respond to questions or follow commands.

The patient's fever, night sweats, and leukocytosis also support this diagnosis.\n\nHematuria (blood in the urine) is a possible sequela of endocarditis due to the embolic phenomenon. Bacteria can break loose from the infected heart valve and travel to other parts of the body, including the kidneys, causing damage and bleeding. However, it is essential to note that the patient's presentation and history should be thoroughly evaluated, and further diagnostic testing, such as echocardiogram and blood cultures, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n    Background Question: A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500).

During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally.

The presence of malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and hazy infiltrate on the chest X-ray are suggestive of an opportunistic infection.\n\nPharyngoesophageal diverticulum is a condition where there is an outpouching of the pharyngeal or esophageal wall, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described in this case, such as cough and malodorous phlegm. \n\nPCP is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts, and it typically presents with symptoms such as cough, fever, night sweats, and shortness of breath.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500).

Order a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out cryptococcal meningitis or other central nervous system infections.\n2. Check a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function tests (LFTs), and creatine kinase (CK) levels to evaluate for potential medication toxicities or other underlying conditions.\n3. Review the patient's medication adherence and consider switching to a more tolerable ART regimen if necessary.\n4. Consider imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan of the brain, to evaluate for other neurological conditions.\n\nIt's also essential to note that the use of empiric itraconazole for the past 10 years may not be the best approach, as it is not a standard treatment for most opportunistic infections.

Given her previous negative tests, we can assume she's still negative for those conditions. However, we need to test for:\n\n1. HIV: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, it's essential to test for HIV at least once during pregnancy, as the window period for HIV tests can be up to 3 months. We should perform an HIV antibody and antigen test.\n2. Syphilis: We should test for syphilis, as it's a common STI that can be asymptomatic in its early stages. A VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test or a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test would be a good starting point.\n3. Group B Streptococcus (GBS): Since she's nulliparous, we should perform a GBS screening at 35-37 weeks of gestation, but it's not typically done at the first visit.\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen: Although she's up-to-date on vaccinations, it's essential to test for Hepatitis B surface antigen to ensure she's not infected.\n5. Urine analysis: A urinalysis will help us evaluate for any potential urinary tract infections or other issues.\n6.

However, the presence of these lesions in an HIV-positive patient with multiple sexual partners raises the possibility of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nHPV (Human Papillomavirus) types 6 and 11 are more commonly associated with condyloma acuminata, not types 16 and 18, which are more commonly linked to cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status, it's also essential to consider other STIs, such as syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which can present with similar skin lesions. Further investigation, including STI screening and possibly a biopsy, may be necessary to determine the exact etiology of these lesions.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings.

He became sputum smear-negative and showed improvement, but then pyrazinamide was stopped and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was added.\n\nThe new symptoms (fever, increased cough, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy) suggest a possible immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a known complication in HIV patients starting ART, especially when co-infected with TB.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and recent initiation of ART, the most appropriate initial step is to add corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further immune-mediated damage. The TB regimen should not be changed at this point. The addition of streptomycin to the TB regimen is not necessary based on the information provided, and the patient's current TB regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol) is still appropriate.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

The presence of proteinuria and edema in this patient, along with his HIV status, makes HIVAN a more likely etiology than Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), which is typically associated with hepatitis C or other causes.\n\nIt's essential to review the patient's HIV viral load and CD4 count to assess the severity of his HIV infection. I would recommend ordering an HIV viral load and CD4 count, as well as a renal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of HIVAN.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting.

The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray and the loss of balance when asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes (Romberg's sign) are suggestive of tabes dorsalis, a form of neurosyphilis.\n\nHowever, the Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is not the most reliable test for syphilis. In fact, ASO titers are more commonly used to diagnose streptococcal infections, such as rheumatic fever.\n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis is the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) or the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. These tests are highly specific and sensitive for detecting syphilis.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's HIV status and history of missed antiretroviral therapy may also be contributing factors to his condition, and further evaluation and treatment for HIV should be considered.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses.

There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

The standard dose of Allopurinol for preventing TLS is 600-800 mg/day, and even then, it may not be enough for high-risk patients like this one.\n\nThe therapy to reverse the patient's metabolic abnormalities would be:\n\n1. Hemodialysis to remove excess uric acid, potassium, and other waste products from the blood.\n2. Allopurinol dose escalation to 800-1200 mg/day to help reduce uric acid production.\n3. Rasburicase (a recombinant urate oxidase) may be added to break down uric acid and prevent its accumulation.\n4. Potassium-lowering medications (e.g., sodium polystyrene sulfonate) to manage hyperkalemia.\n5. Aggressive hydration and urine alkalization to help prevent uric acid crystallization in the kidneys.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a nephrologist or a specialist in oncology to manage this patient's TLS and prevent further complications.\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
