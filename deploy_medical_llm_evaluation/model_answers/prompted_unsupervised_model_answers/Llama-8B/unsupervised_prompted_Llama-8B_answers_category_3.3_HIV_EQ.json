The patient's low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L) and history of skipping antiretroviral medications suggest immunosuppression, making her susceptible to PML. The MRI findings of numerous hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally, along with the brain biopsy results showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes, are consistent with PML. The patient's neurological symptoms, such as diplopia, disorientation, and uncoordinated gait, are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

However, the risk is relatively low at standard doses.\n\n2. **Hemolysis**: Zidovudine can cause hemolysis, especially at high doses. This is more common in patients with a lower baseline hemoglobin level.\n\n3. **Lipodystrophy**: Indinavir can cause lipodystrophy, including lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat) and lipohypertrophy (accumulation of fat in the abdominal area). This is more common with long-term use.\n\n4. **Gastrointestinal intolerance**: Lamivudine and zidovudine can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n5. **Diabetes**: Indinavir can cause insulin resistance, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n6. **Hyperlipidemia**: Indinavir can cause elevations in triglycerides and cholesterol levels.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the patient's renal function, hemoglobin levels, lipid profiles, and glucose levels regularly while on this treatment regimen.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

The patient's history of inconsistent antiretroviral therapy and low CD4 count (90/\u03bcL) also increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies. \n\nThe positive PCR for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid is a strong indicator of PCNSL, as EBV is a known etiological agent in this condition, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is less likely given his CD4 count is above 200, but it's still a consideration in HIV patients.\n2.  Influenza is possible, but the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 days, which is a bit longer than typical for influenza.\n3.  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a broad category, but the patient's history and presentation make it a strong possibility.\n4.  Given the patient's smoking history, I would consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia less likely, and tuberculosis (TB) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) would be less likely given the patient's CD4 count is above 200.\n5.  The most likely cause of pneumonia in this patient would be a typical bacterial pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's history of HIV and smoking, and the fact that he works as a carpenter, I would like to consider Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a possible cause.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter.

The presence of bright red, friable nodules on the skin, along with the biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils, are consistent with KS. KS is a type of cancer that is more common in individuals with HIV/AIDS, especially those with low CD4+ counts.\n\nThe patient's history of not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) for over 5 years and his low CD4+ count further support this diagnosis. The abdominal ultrasonography findings of hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic lesion may also be consistent with KS, as it can involve the liver.\n\nIt's worth noting that the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is negative, which makes syphilis less likely. However, it's essential to consider other differential diagnoses, such as bacillary angiomatosis or bacillary epithelioid angiomatosis, which can also present with skin lesions and low CD4+ counts.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion.

However, without stool microscopy results, it's difficult to confirm the exact diagnosis.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts, often presenting with watery diarrhea and abdominal pain. Isosporiasis is another possibility, but it's less common.\n\nIt's also essential to consider the patient's non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy, which may have contributed to his low CD4 count and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.\n\nFurther testing, including stool microscopy for ova and parasites, and possibly an upper GI series or imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications.

The lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, and high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in the pleural fluid are also consistent with TB. The patient's HIV status and history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy may also contribute to his susceptibility to opportunistic infections like TB.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest.

The MRI findings of disseminated, non-enhancing white matter lesions are also typical of HAND. The patient's low CD4 count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) further support this diagnosis, as they indicate advanced HIV disease.\n\nThe Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity is not relevant to the current presentation, as it indicates past exposure to the parasite, and the cryptococcal antigen is negative, which makes cryptococcal meningitis less likely.\n\nThe patient's other medical conditions, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, may contribute to his overall health status but are not directly related to his current neurological symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

This may involve switching to a more potent regimen or adding medications to his current regimen.\n\nIn addition to ART, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.  **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)**: Given his low CD4 count, the patient is at high risk for PCP. A 3-month course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for PCP prophylaxis.\n\n2.  **Antifungal prophylaxis**: Patients with a CD4 count below 100 cells/mm3 are at increased risk for opportunistic fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis. I would recommend fluconazole for cryptococcal prophylaxis.\n\n3.  **Antibacterial prophylaxis**: A patient with a CD4 count below 100 cells/mm3 is at increased risk for bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) or Salmonella. I would recommend isoniazid (INH) for TB prophylaxis, but only if TB testing is negative.\n\n4.  **Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation**: Malabsorption of these nutrients can occur in patients with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with low CD4 counts. Supplementing with vitamin B12 and folate may help alleviate symptoms.\n\n5.  **Psychiatric evaluation and treatment**: The patient's depression is likely contributing to his non-adherence to medication. A mental health professional should evaluate and treat his depression to improve adherence to his HIV treatment regimen.\n\nIt's essential to note that these recommendations may vary depending on the patient's specific clinical presentation, medical history, and local guidelines.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months.

This is a standard practice for infants born to HIV-positive mothers, regardless of the mother's viral load or the presence of any symptoms in the newborn. The goal is to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all HIV-exposed newborns receive a 6-week course of zidovudine, starting within 12-24 hours of birth. This will help prevent HIV transmission and reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman.

The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) also supports this diagnosis. \n\nThe sequela of infective endocarditis can include embolic events (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction), heart failure, and sepsis. Given the patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 450/mm3, there is a risk of opportunistic infections, but in this case, the clinical presentation is more suggestive of an infectious endocarditis rather than an opportunistic infection.\n    Background Question: A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500).

However, the presence of FSGS is a more common cause of nephrotic syndrome in this population.\n\nUnder light microscopy, a kidney biopsy in FSGS would typically show:\n\n- Segmental scarring of glomeruli, which may be sclerotic or fibrotic\n- Collapse or effacement of the glomerular capillary tufts\n- Podocyte injury and detachment\n\nHowever, without a kidney biopsy report, this is only a clinical suspicion.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally.

The patient has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (280/mm^3), indicating immunocompromised status, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections like PCP.\n2.  The symptoms of cough, malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and fever are consistent with PCP.\n3.  The patient's history of HIV infection and lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy further increases the risk of opportunistic infections.\n4.  The physical examination findings of crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base, along with a hazy infiltrate on the chest x-ray, are consistent with PCP.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's alcohol use and smoking history may also contribute to his respiratory symptoms, but the combination of his immunocompromised status and the specific symptoms and findings point towards PCP as the most likely diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500).

This will help identify potential infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, or CNS tuberculosis.\n\nAdditionally, I would also order a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for potential electrolyte imbalances, liver function, and cardiac status.\n\nA CT or MRI of the brain would also be beneficial to rule out structural causes of the weakness, such as a stroke or a tumor.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's history of inconsistent adherence to his HIV medications increases the risk of developing opportunistic infections. Therefore, it's crucial to assess his medication regimen and adherence, and adjust as necessary.\n\nLastly, I would also consider starting empiric antibiotics and antiviral therapy, pending the results of the LP and other investigations, to cover for potential infections.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen.

The patient's ART should be continued as well, but a change in the antitubercular regimen is not necessary. The patient's symptoms may require supportive care, such as antipyretics and cough suppressants, and close monitoring of the patient's condition.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

Hypoalbuminemia secondary to malnutrition or liver disease.\n2.  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV patients.\n3.  Other secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or autoimmune disorders.\n\nIt's essential to further investigate the cause of proteinuria through additional tests, including a 24-hour urine protein collection, serum albumin levels, and potentially a renal biopsy to determine the underlying cause of his kidney disease.\n\nGiven the patient's history of heroin addiction, it's also essential to consider potential drug-related causes of kidney disease, such as heroin-induced nephropathy.\n\nA comprehensive evaluation and management plan should be developed in collaboration with a nephrologist to address the patient's renal disease and overall health.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min.

Given the history of HIV, the widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray, and the presence of a holodiastolic murmur, I would suspect that the patient has cardiac involvement, likely cardiac sarcoidosis or cardiac lymphoma, but more likely given his presentation, cardiac sarcoidosis is less likely than one other condition: \n\nThe key findings that point towards a specific diagnosis are the widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray, which is suggestive of a pericardial effusion or a mass, and the patient's inability to stand and maintain balance ( Romberg's sign), which is indicative of a cerebellar dysfunction. The presence of a holodiastolic murmur could be due to cardiac involvement.\n\nHowever, the combination of cerebellar dysfunction, widening of the mediastinum, and a holodiastolic murmur is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), specifically the Ocular-Specific variant known as Primary CNS Lymphoma with ocular involvement. \n\nThe patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and inability to climb stairs may be related to a pericardial effusion or a mass that is compromising cardiac function.\n\nThe management of this patient would involve a multidisciplinary approach including oncology, cardiology, and neurology. \n\nThe immediate steps would include:\n\n1. MRI of the brain to confirm the diagnosis of PCNSL\n2. Echocardiogram to assess the extent of cardiac involvement\n3. Cardiac biomarkers to assess cardiac function\n4. Treatment with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and swelling in the central nervous system and potentially alleviate symptoms\n\nHowever, this is a complex case that requires a comprehensive evaluation and management plan by a multidisciplinary team.\n\nRegarding the missed doses of antiretroviral therapy, it is essential to address this as well, as it may be contributing to the patient's immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

It occurs when the rapid destruction of cancer cells releases large amounts of cellular contents, including uric acid, phosphate, and potassium, into the bloodstream, leading to acute kidney injury.\n\nThe elevated potassium level (6.9 mEq/L) also supports this diagnosis, as TLS often presents with hyperkalemia due to the release of intracellular potassium into the bloodstream.\n\nThe bounding pulses and pale complexion may also be consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, as the patient's body is experiencing a significant release of cellular contents.\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n What is the most likely diagnosis?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
