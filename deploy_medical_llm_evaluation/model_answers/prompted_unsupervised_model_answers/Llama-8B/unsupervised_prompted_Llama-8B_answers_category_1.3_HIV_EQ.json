Here are the common methods:\n\n1. **Rapid HIV tests**: These are point-of-care tests that provide results in 15-60 minutes. They detect the presence of antibodies or antigens (proteins) on the surface of the virus.\n2. **Serum tests**: Blood tests that detect the presence of antibodies or antigens in the blood. These tests can be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n3. **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests**: These tests detect the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of the virus in the blood or other bodily fluids.\n4. **Antigen tests**: These tests detect the presence of viral antigens, which can be used to diagnose HIV in people who are recently infected and may not yet have developed antibodies.\n\nA diagnosis of HIV is typically confirmed by a positive result from two different tests, such as a rapid test and a serum test, or two serum tests.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

The individual may not show any symptoms, and the virus is not detectable in blood tests.\n3. **Chronic Infection (10 years or more)**: The virus continues to replicate, and the immune system is gradually weakened. The individual may experience opportunistic infections and cancers.\n4. **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)**: The immune system is severely compromised, and the individual is highly susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers.

This reduces the viral load, minimizing the risk of transmission.\n3. **Elective cesarean delivery**: Scheduled C-sections can reduce the risk of transmission, especially if the mother's viral load is high.\n4. **Avoid breastfeeding**: Exclusive formula feeding is recommended to prevent postnatal transmission.\n5. **Prophylactic antiretroviral therapy for the baby**: Administering ART to the newborn within 6 hours of birth, and continuing for 6 weeks, significantly reduces the risk of transmission.\n6. **HIV testing for the newborn**: Perform a test for HIV at birth, and again at 14-16 days and 1-2 months of age to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThese interventions can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 5%.\n    Background Question: How can we prevent Perinatal transmission of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

HIV specifically targets and infects these cells by binding to the CD4 receptors on their surface.\n2. **Monocytes/macrophages**: These are another type of white blood cell that can also be infected by HIV.\n\nThese cells are the primary targets of HIV, and their infection leads to the gradual weakening of the immune system, making the individual more susceptible to opportunistic infections and diseases.\n    Background Question: What are the main cell types infected with HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

At this stage, the person is highly susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers that a healthy person's immune system would normally be able to fight off.\n\nIn other words, HIV is the virus itself, while AIDS is the condition that results from the virus if it is not effectively treated.\n    Background Question: What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

This is often seen in individuals with well-controlled viral loads on antiretroviral therapy (ART). \n\nThe switch to active infection can occur through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Viral reactivation**: The latent virus can reactivate due to various factors, such as immune system dysfunction, inflammation, or co-infections.\n2. **Immune system suppression**: A weakened immune system can allow the virus to become active.\n3. **ART non-adherence**: Stopping or interrupting ART can lead to viral rebound.\n4. **Host genetic factors**: Certain genetic variations can influence the likelihood of viral reactivation.\n\nWhen the virus reactivates, it can lead to a rise in viral load, potentially causing symptoms and disease progression.\n\nKeep in mind that the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to clarify the factors involved in this switch.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
