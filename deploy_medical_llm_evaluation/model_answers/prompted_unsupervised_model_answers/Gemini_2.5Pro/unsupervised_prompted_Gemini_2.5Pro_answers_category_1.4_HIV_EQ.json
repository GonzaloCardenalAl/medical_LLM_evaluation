    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specializing in HIV. Your role involves critically assessing and grade a medical student\u2019s explanation.

Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

They detect both HIV antibodies and a protein of the virus called p24 antigen.\n2.  **Antibody Tests:** These look specifically for antibodies to HIV. They can be done with rapid tests or lab tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs):** These tests look for the actual virus in the blood. They are not used for routine screening but can diagnose HIV earlier than other tests or confirm a positive result.\n\nA positive screening test usually requires a confirmatory test to finalize the diagnosis.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Many people have flu-like symptoms (fever, rash, sore throat, etc.), but some have none. Viral load is very high.\n2.  **Clinical Latency (Chronic HIV Infection):** The virus is still active but reproduces at lower levels. People may not have symptoms or have very mild ones. This stage can last for many years.\n3.  **AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome):** The most severe stage. The immune system is severely damaged (often defined by a low CD4 count or the presence of opportunistic illnesses). Without treatment, survival is typically about three years at this stage.\n\nEffective HIV treatment (ART) can prevent progression to the later stages, keeping people in the clinical latency stage and healthy for life.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

In an untreated person, HIV is continuously replicating (active infection).\n\nHowever, you're likely asking about the transition from the **latent state of the integrated provirus** within a specific cell to an **actively replicating state**.\n\nHere's what's known:\n\n1.  **Latent reservoir:** HIV integrates its genetic material into the DNA of certain cells (primarily CD4+ T cells), forming a \"provirus.\" In some of these cells, the virus goes into a dormant or latent state, meaning it's not actively producing new virus particles. This is the latent reservoir.\n2.  **Reactivation triggers:** The switch from this latent state back to active replication (reactivation) is primarily triggered by signals that activate the host cell.\n3.  **Immune activation:** Key triggers involve general immune activation, such as that caused by other infections, inflammation, or stimulation of T cell receptors.\n4.  **Molecular signals:** These activating signals lead to the activation of certain cellular proteins (transcription factors, like NF-kB) that bind to the HIV DNA (specifically, the LTR region) and promote the expression of viral genes.\n5.  **Replication starts:** Once viral genes are expressed, the cell starts producing new virus particles, effectively \"reactivating\" the infection from that latent provirus.\n\nUnderstanding these triggers is crucial for HIV cure research, which aims to eliminate or permanently silence this latent reservoir.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
