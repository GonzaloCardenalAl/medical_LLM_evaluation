Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

They are highly accurate and can detect infection relatively early.\n2.  **Antibody Tests:** These older tests look only for HIV antibodies. They are also accurate but may take longer after exposure to become positive. Rapid tests often fall into this category.\n3.  **RNA Tests:** These tests look for the virus's genetic material. They are used to diagnose very early infection or to confirm other test results.\n\nA positive initial test always requires a confirmatory test to ensure an accurate diagnosis.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

There are generally considered to be three main stages:\n\n1.  **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, within 2-4 weeks after infection. Some people experience flu-like symptoms, while others have none. The virus is multiplying rapidly.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** In this stage, the virus is still active but reproduces at a much slower rate. People may not have symptoms for many years. With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades and may never progress to Stage 3.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when HIV has severely damaged the immune system. It is defined by a very low CD4 count (below 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, survival is typically about three years at this stage.\n\nIt's important to remember that with proper medical care and ART, people living with HIV can often prevent progression to Stage 3 and live long, healthy lives.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

This state is maintained primarily because the host cell is in a resting or quiescent state.\n\nThe \"switch\" to active infection, leading to viral replication, is primarily triggered by **cellular activation**. When a latently infected cell becomes activated (e.g., by encountering an antigen, cytokines, or other stimuli), intracellular signaling pathways are initiated.\n\nThese signaling pathways, particularly those involving transcription factors like NF-kB, can bind to the HIV promoter region (the LTR - Long Terminal Repeat) integrated in the host cell's DNA. This binding turns on the transcription of viral genes, leading to the production of viral RNA and proteins, assembly of new virions, and ultimately, active viral replication.\n\nSo, the transition from latency to active infection is largely driven by the activation state of the infected cell, which provides the necessary cellular environment and transcription factors to initiate viral gene expression. These latent reservoirs are a major challenge for achieving an HIV cure.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
