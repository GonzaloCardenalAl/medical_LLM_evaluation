    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specializing in HIV. Your role involves critically assessing and grade a medical student\u2019s explanation.

Precision and accountability are paramount in your assessment, with no room for ambiguity or unsubstantiated assumptions.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria \n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions. Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: HIV is diagnosed using tests that look for evidence of the virus in the body. The most common methods are:\n\n1.  **Combination Antigen/Antibody Tests:** These blood tests detect both HIV antibodies (produced by the body in response to the virus) and the p24 antigen (a protein from the virus). They are highly accurate and can detect infection earlier than antibody-only tests.\n2.  **Rapid Antibody Tests:** These can use blood (fingerstick) or oral fluid and provide results quickly (often 20-30 minutes). They are primarily screening tests.\n3.  **Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT/PCR):** These tests detect the actual genetic material of the virus. They are used for diagnosing acute infection (very early stages) or for confirming positive results from other tests.\n\nAny positive screening test (like a rapid antibody test) always requires a confirmatory test, typically a combination antigen/antibody test or a NAT, to ensure accuracy.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Many people have flu-like symptoms during this time. There is a high viral load.\n2.  **Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency):** This stage can last for many years. The virus is still active but reproduces at lower levels. People may have no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild ones. With effective treatment (ART), people can stay in this stage for decades.\n3.  **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** This is the most severe stage. It occurs when HIV has severely damaged the immune system. It is defined by a low CD4 count (below 200 cells/mm\u00b3) or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, survival is typically about three years.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

It is the **virus** itself. HIV attacks and weakens the immune system, specifically targeting CD4 T cells.\n2.  **AIDS** stands for **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome**. It is the **most advanced stage** of HIV infection. AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has severely damaged the immune system, typically defined by a very low CD4 cell count or the presence of specific opportunistic infections or cancers that indicate severe immune deficiency.\n\nSo, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.

This is the latent reservoir.\n2.  **Reactivation:** This dormant virus can be triggered to become active and start replicating again.\n3.  **The Trigger:** The primary trigger for this switch from latency to active replication is **cellular activation**.\n4.  **Causes of Activation:** When a latent infected cell (like a resting CD4+ T cell) becomes activated (e.g., by exposure to an antigen during an infection, inflammation, or other immune stimuli), the conditions inside the cell become favorable for the integrated HIV DNA to be transcribed and translated, leading to the production of new virus particles.\n\nSo, the switch isn't an internal clock, but rather the cell hosting the latent virus receiving a signal to become metabolically active, which in turn allows the virus to resume replication. This process of reservoir reactivation is a major barrier to curing HIV.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
