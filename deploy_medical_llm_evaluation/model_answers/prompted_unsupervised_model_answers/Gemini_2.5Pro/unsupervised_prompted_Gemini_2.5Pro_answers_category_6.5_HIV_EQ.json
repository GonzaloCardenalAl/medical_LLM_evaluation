At that time, only a very limited number of antiretroviral drugs were available, and combination therapy (using multiple drugs together) was not the standard approach.\n\nThe main, and likely only, frequently administered antiretroviral drug in 1990, including in Switzerland, was **zidovudine (AZT)**.\n\nTherefore, the concept of the \"five most frequently administered\" drugs doesn't really apply to 1990, as there simply weren't five distinct drugs widely in use. Treatment primarily relied on monotherapy with AZT.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

While national birth rates are tracked, collecting data on birth rates specifically broken down by HIV status is complex and not typically reported in standard public health statistics.\n\nTo accurately compare the birth rate between women with and without HIV, you would need detailed data on:\n1.

Comparable data for the general female population without HIV.\n\nThis kind of detailed, population-wide comparison based on health status is not routinely collected or published in a way that allows for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer or a precise numerical difference.

Feelings of being treated like outcasts are a direct consequence of stigma, which unfortunately persists.\n\nHowever, finding a precise, publicly available statistic for the proportion of PWH in Switzerland who felt *exactly* like 'outcasts' in the specific year 2020 is difficult. Surveys on stigma and discrimination among PWH are conducted, but the exact wording of questions can vary, and comprehensive results for a specific feeling in a particular year might not always be published or readily accessible.\n\nWhile stigma remains a significant issue for many PWH globally and in Switzerland, I don't have the exact percentage you requested for 2020 based on a specific survey question using that precise phrase.\n    Background Question: From 2020, what proportion of PWH in Switzerland consider that 'People with HIV are treated like outcasts'?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Such granular analysis might exist within the FOPH or the SHCS data but is not typically found in public reports.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide that specific proportion.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
