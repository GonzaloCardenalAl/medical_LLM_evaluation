At that time, the number of available antiretroviral drugs was very limited, and combination therapy was not yet the standard of care.\n\nThe first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine (AZT), was approved in the late 1980s and was the primary treatment available in 1990. Other drugs like didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC) were only becoming available or were still in clinical trials around that time and were not in widespread, frequent use.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to list five frequently administered antiretroviral drugs in Switzerland in 1990, as that many distinct drugs were simply not in common clinical use at that point. Zidovudine would have been the main, and often only, antiretroviral drug administered.\n    Background Question: Which five antiretroviral drugs were most frequently administered in 1990 in Switzerland?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specializing in HIV. Your role involves critically assessing and grade a medical student\u2019s explanation. You must evaluate the student\u2019s response with strict adherence to the evaluation criteria outlined, using specific evidence from the answers to justify each score. Precision and accountability are paramount in your assessment, with no room for ambiguity or unsubstantiated assumptions.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria \n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions. Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2. Reasoning Steps\n       - Deduct points for any logical fallacies, unclear rationale, or steps that deviate from the correct reasoning.\n       - Score low if the reasoning lacks clarity or is inconsistent with medical principles.\n    \n    3. Recall of Knowledge\n       - Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.\n       - A lower score should reflect the severity and frequency of factual errors.\n    \n    4. Bias Towards Demographic Groups\n       - Be highly critical of language or reasoning that reflects implicit or explicit bias, scoring severely for such instances.\n       - A perfect score requires complete neutrality and sensitivity.\n    \n    5. Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: Thank you for your question.\n\nDetermining the *exact proportion* of people in Switzerland who died specifically from *HIV-related causes* AND had their first positive HIV test *before the age of 20* is very difficult based on readily available published data.\n\nWhile public health statistics in Switzerland track HIV diagnoses, prevalence, and mortality, the data is typically not broken down to this specific level of detail (i.e., the proportion *within the group who died of HIV-related causes* who were diagnosed before a specific young age).\n\nData is usually reported in broader categories such as age at death or overall mortality rates among PWH. Deaths specifically attributable *to HIV-related causes* are also less common now with effective treatment, making this subset smaller and harder to analyze precisely in this manner.\n\nTherefore, this specific statistic is not readily available in standard published reports from Swiss health authorities or major cohorts.\n    Background Question: In Switzerland, What proportion of PWH who died from HIV-related causes had their first positive HIV test before the age of 20?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Age *can* influence progression, but the effect might vary depending on the age range and other factors.\n2.  Comparing progression rates for untreated or variably treated individuals (common in 1990-2010) is complex due to evolving guidelines and individual treatment decisions.\n3.  Factors like viral load and individual biological variability are also strong predictors of CD4 decline.\n\nTo definitively answer if there was a statistically significant difference *specifically* for that group (Switzerland, 1990-2010, initial CD4 >300, split at age 20) regarding the time to drop below 200, one would need to analyze the specific data from a cohort study covering that population and time period.\n\nGeneral knowledge does not provide a simple \"yes, there is a difference, and this is what it is\" for this very specific historical group. It would require detailed epidemiological analysis.\n    Background Question: For individuals in Switzerland who had their first positive HIV test between 1990 and 2010 and an initial CD4 count above 300, is there a difference between PWH tested before or after the age of 20 and the time taken for the CD4 cell count to drop below 200?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
