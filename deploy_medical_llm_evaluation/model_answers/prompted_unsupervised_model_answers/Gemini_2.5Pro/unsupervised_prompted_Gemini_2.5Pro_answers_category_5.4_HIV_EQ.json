The asymmetric, non-enhancing white matter lesions and biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes are the classic signature of PML, caused by reactivation of the JC virus in the setting of severe immunosuppression. This is highly consistent with the patient's poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

PCNSL is strongly associated with EBV infection in immunocompromised individuals, and CSF EBV PCR is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test in this setting.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.

The patient's immune status (normal CD4 count) means he is susceptible to the same common pathogens as the general population.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

While *Mycobacterium avium* can cause disseminated disease in advanced HIV, the specific skin lesions and biopsy findings described are not typical for MAC and strongly point towards Bartonella.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500). A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion.

This parasite is a common cause of severe, chronic watery diarrhea in patients with advanced HIV and can also cause biliary disease (acalculous cholecystitis or sclerosing cholangitis), which would explain the right upper quadrant pain.\n\nWhile other opportunistic infections like CMV or MAC could also cause diarrhea and abdominal symptoms in this setting, Cryptosporidiosis is a very strong candidate for this specific presentation.\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder and would be extremely unlikely in an immunocompromised patient with these symptoms; opportunistic infections must be ruled out first.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications.

While malignancy can also cause effusions, this specific profile is highly suggestive of TB.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung.

The characteristic MRI findings of disseminated, non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are highly suggestive of PML.\n\nWhile vascular dementia is a cause of cognitive decline, the MRI findings described (disseminated, non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect) are not typical for vascular dementia, which usually involves infarcts or chronic ischemic changes often with different patterns. Furthermore, the profound immunosuppression in this patient strongly directs the differential diagnosis towards opportunistic infections or malignancies associated with advanced HIV.\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive.

A CD4 count of 33 cells/mm3 indicates severe immunosuppression and a very high risk of opportunistic infections. Restarting effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is crucial, along with addressing the underlying depression which led to non-adherence.\n\nRegarding additional medications for prophylaxis, at a CD4 count of 33 cells/mm3, primary prophylaxis against several opportunistic infections is strongly indicated:\n\n1.  **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP):** Prophylaxis is needed when CD4 is below 200 cells/mm3. The preferred medication is Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n2.  **Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis:** Prophylaxis is needed when CD4 is below 100 cells/mm3 and the patient is Toxoplasma seropositive. TMP-SMX is also the preferred medication and is effective against both PCP and Toxoplasmosis.\n3.  **Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC):** Prophylaxis is needed when CD4 is below 50 cells/mm3. The preferred medications are Azithromycin or Clarithromycin.\n\nTherefore, in addition to restarting ART, this patient should receive **Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole** (typically daily) and **Azithromycin** (typically weekly). Toxoplasma serology should be checked, but TMP-SMX is needed for PCP prophylaxis regardless.\n\nWhile Fluconazole is used to treat or prevent certain fungal infections like oral/esophageal candidiasis or cryptococcosis (especially if CD4 is <100 and there is a risk), it is **not** the most frequent or primary prophylactic medication prescribed to cover the major risks (PCP, Toxoplasmosis, MAC) in a patient with a CD4 count of 33 cells/mm3. TMP-SMX and a macrolide (Azithromycin or Clarithromycin) are the standard primary prophylaxes at this CD4 level.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole.

Simultaneous steps include stabilizing the patient, obtaining blood work (including CD4 count, viral load if not recent, blood cultures, cryptococcal antigen), and considering empiric therapy depending on the most likely diagnoses based on imaging and local epidemiology.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion. He is a cachectic man in acute distress, unable to respond to questions or follow commands. His friend confides that the patient has been sexually active with multiple male partners and was diagnosed with HIV several months ago, but was lost to follow up.

During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.

This patient has HIV and evidence of nephrotic syndrome (edema, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, hyperlipidemia).\n\nYou mentioned that doctors most frequently observe mesangial proliferation in kidney biopsies for patients with these symptoms. While mesangial proliferation can be seen in various kidney diseases, it is not the *most frequent* finding in the context of HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome, particularly in a patient of African descent like this.\n\nIn a patient with HIV and nephrotic syndrome, the most likely kidney biopsy finding is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Under light microscopy, the characteristic features of HIVAN are:\n\n1.  **Collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS):** Glomeruli show collapse of the capillary loops and proliferation of podocytes.\n2.  **Microcystic tubular dilation:** Enlarged tubules containing proteinaceous casts.\n3.  **Tubular interstitial inflammation and fibrosis:** Damage to the tubules and surrounding tissue.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased around the mouth and along the fingers. Laboratory studies show:\n\nSerum:\nAlbumin 2.5 g/dL\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nHIV antibody positive\n\nUrine:\nBlood negative\nProtein +4\nRBC 1-2/hpf\nRBC casts negative\n\n Most frequently, doctors observe mesangial proliferation in kidney biopsies of patients with these symptoms.

The presence of malodorous phlegm, the location of the infiltrate in the right lower lobe, and significant risk factors like heavy alcohol use and appearing intoxicated are highly suggestive of **aspiration pneumonia**.\n\nRegarding your statement about pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, while aspiration can be a *complication* of a diverticulum, the symptoms described (fever, cough with malodorous phlegm, infiltrate on X-ray) represent an acute infection, specifically pneumonia. Doctors would diagnose the *pneumonia* as the cause of these acute symptoms, not the diverticulum itself. A diverticulum might be an underlying predisposing factor for aspiration, but it's not the direct diagnosis for the acute infectious process you've described.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum.

Identify the location and nature of any structural lesion (e.g., stroke, opportunistic infection like Toxoplasmosis or Cryptococcoma, primary CNS lymphoma, abscess).\n\nSubsequent steps, including further diagnostic workup (like lumbar puncture) and initiation of appropriate empiric treatment, will depend on the imaging findings and other laboratory results. Empiric itraconazole is not the standard initial empiric treatment for focal brain lesions in advanced HIV; empiric therapy often targets Toxoplasmosis initially, depending on the clinical and imaging findings.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

This is usually done with systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, while continuing both the antitubercular therapy and the ART.\n\nThe information about your hospital's past practice of adding streptomycin to the initial TB regimen seems unrelated to the current clinical problem, which is likely IRIS occurring after initial treatment and ART initiation. The current presentation requires management of the inflammatory response.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

While other conditions like MPGN (potentially related to co-infections like Hepatitis C, common with IV drug use) or other causes of FSGS (like obesity-related or post-adaptive) are in the differential, uncontrolled HIV is a strong driver for HIVAN in this demographic. A kidney biopsy is typically needed to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate from other causes of glomerular disease.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction.

It is not used to diagnose syphilis. It is incorrect to use ASO titer for this clinical scenario.\n\nThe most reliable assays to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis are **syphilis serological tests**. These include:\n\n1.  **Non-treponemal tests:** Such as RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) or VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory). These measure antibodies against cardiolipin and typically reflect disease activity.\n2.  **Treponemal tests:** Such as TP-PA (Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination), FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption), or EIA/CIA (Enzyme Immunoassay/Chemiluminescence Immunoassay). These measure antibodies specific to *Treponema pallidum* and are typically used to confirm a positive non-treponemal test. They usually remain positive for life.\n\nA presumptive diagnosis of syphilis is typically made based on a positive non-treponemal test confirmed by a positive treponemal test. Further evaluation, including CSF analysis (VDRL, cell count, protein) and potentially CSF treponemal testing, is often necessary to diagnose neurosyphilis, which appears likely in this case.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

Given the severe hyperuricemia (28 mg/dL) and acute kidney injury, the most effective therapy to *reverse* these metabolic abnormalities and the severe hyperuricemia is **Rasburicase**. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that rapidly converts uric acid to the more soluble allantoin, which is easily excreted by the kidneys.\n\nAggressive intravenous hydration and management of hyperkalemia are also critical components of therapy.\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness.
