HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Toxoplasmosis\n4. Central nervous system lymphoma\n\nBased on the patient's history of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4 count, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nPML is a severe opportunistic infection of the central nervous system, commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced HIV infection and low CD4 counts. The MRI findings of asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions without mass effect are consistent with PML. The brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes further supports this diagnosis.\n\nWhile HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) can present with cognitive impairment and motor symptoms, the MRI findings and biopsy results are not typical for HAND. Toxoplasmosis would typically show enhancing lesions on MRI, and central nervous system lymphoma would likely present with mass effect and different histopathological findings on biopsy.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).

Lipodystrophy\n2. Hyperglycemia\n3. Hypercholesterolemia\n4. Pancreatitis\n5. Hepatotoxicity\n\nAnswer: 4. Pancreatitis\n\nExplanation: The patient is currently on indinavir, which is a protease inhibitor known to cause pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The other options, while possible side effects of antiretroviral therapy, are not specifically associated with indinavir. Lipodystrophy, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia are more commonly linked to other protease inhibitors like ritonavir or atazanavir, or to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like stavudine. Hepatotoxicity can occur with various antiretroviral medications, but it is not uniquely tied to indinavir. Given the recent prescription of indinavir and the known side effect profile, pancreatitis is the most relevant risk for this patient.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? \n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Glioblastoma\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nBased on the patient's history, symptoms, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)\n\nExplanation:\n- The patient's history of HIV and inconsistent antireviral therapy adherence increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, such as PCNSL.\n- The neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy) and low Mini-Mental State Examination score suggest significant cognitive impairment and brain involvement.\n- The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum is consistent with PCNSL, which often presents as a single, large lesion in immunocompromised patients.\n- The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of PCNSL, as EBV is commonly associated with this malignancy in HIV-positive individuals.\n- While toxoplasmosis can present similarly, the MRI appearance and EBV positivity make PCNSL more likely. Glioblastoma is less likely given the patient's immunocompromised status and the presence of EBV DNA. Cryptococcal meningitis would typically present with more pronounced CSF abnormalities and a different MRI appearance.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma.

Staphylococcus aureus\n2. Streptococcus pneumoniae\n3. Haemophilus influenzae\n4. Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n5. Legionella pneumophila\n\nBased on the patient's history, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae (option 2). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient's presentation with fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, along with crackles on lung examination, strongly suggests community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n2. The patient's HIV status and CD4+ count (520/mm\u00b3) indicate that he is immunocompetent enough to mount a response against typical bacterial pathogens, making opportunistic infections less likely.\n3. The recent case of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in another patient does not necessarily imply that this patient's infection is also caused by S. aureus. Each case should be evaluated independently based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n4. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of CAP, especially in smokers, and the patient's smoking history increases his risk for pneumococcal infection.\n5. Haemophilus influenzae (option 3) is also a possible cause of CAP, but it's less likely given the absence of any specific risk factors (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent influenza infection) in this patient.\n6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (option 4) is more commonly associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia or infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe immunosuppression, which does not apply to this patient.\n7. Legionella pneumophila (option 5) is typically associated with outbreaks in specific settings (e.g., hotels, cruise ships) and is less likely in this case given the patient's occupation and residence in Illinois.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and risk factors, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely causal organism for this case of community-acquired pneumonia.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

This opportunistic infection commonly affects individuals with advanced HIV and low CD4+ counts, as seen in this patient (180/mm3). The skin lesions described, characterized by bright red, friable nodules, are consistent with cutaneous MAC. The presence of hepatomegaly and an intrahepatic lesion on ultrasonography also supports disseminated MAC infection.

Here's why:\n\n- Watery diarrhea, fever, and right upper quadrant pain are consistent with a parasitic infection like Cryptosporidiosis, which is an opportunistic infection common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with low CD4+ counts (in this case, 88/mm3).\n- The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy likely contributed to his immunosuppressed state, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections.\n- Irritable bowel syndrome (Option 2) is less likely given the fever and systemic symptoms (malaise, nausea, anorexia) that are not typical of IBS.\n- HIV enteropathy (Option 3) is a chronic condition characterized by malabsorption and diarrhea, but it typically lacks acute symptoms like fever and right upper quadrant pain.\n- Bacterial gastroenteritis (Option 4) could be considered, but the patient's immunocompromised state and low CD4+ count make Cryptosporidiosis a more plausible explanation for his symptoms.\n\nPending stool microscopy results will likely confirm Cryptosporidiosis by identifying oocysts in the stool sample.\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 100/84 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed which is within normal limits. His blood tests results are given below:\n\nHb%: 11 gm/dL\nTotal count (WBC): 3,400 /mm3\nDifferential count:\nNeutrophils: 70%\nLymphocytes: 25%\nMonocytes: 5%\nCD4+ cell count: 88/mm3\n\nStool microscopy results are pending.

Lung cancer\n2. Tuberculosis\n3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n4. Bacterial pneumonia\n\nBased on the patient's history, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of his condition is tuberculosis (option 2). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has a history of HIV infection with a low CD4+ count (240/mm3), which increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections like tuberculosis.\n2. He has been living in a homeless shelter, which can facilitate transmission of tuberculosis due to overcrowding and poor ventilation.\n3. The symptoms of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain are consistent with tuberculosis.\n4. The chest x-ray shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy, both common findings in tuberculosis.\n5. The pleural fluid analysis reveals lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, elevated LDH, and high adenosine deaminase, which are all suggestive of tuberculosis.\n6. While lung cancer (option 1) cannot be completely ruled out, the patient's age, lack of significant smoking-related history for lung cancer development (22 years of smoking is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk, but not necessarily for lung cancer at this age), and the pleural fluid findings make tuberculosis more likely.\n7. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (option 3) is less likely given the presence of a pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy, which are not typical features of PJP.\n8. Bacterial pneumonia (option 4) is also less likely due to the chronic nature of the symptoms (2 weeks), the pleural fluid findings, and the patient's immunocompromised state, which makes tuberculosis a more plausible explanation.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and laboratory findings, tuberculosis is the most likely cause of his condition.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy.

Cryptosporidium parvum\n2. Giardia lamblia\n3. Cyclospora cayetanensis\n4. Isospora belli\n5. Entamoeba histolytica\n\nAnswer: 3. Cyclospora cayetanensis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, travel history, and microscopy findings suggest Cyclospora cayetanensis as the most likely causal organism. Cyclospora is a protozoan parasite commonly found in contaminated water sources, such as spring water, and is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including Mexico. The presence of oocysts in the stool sample supports this diagnosis. While Entamoeba histolytica can cause similar symptoms, the microscopy findings here are more consistent with Cyclospora, as Entamoeba histolytica would typically show trophozoites or cysts, not oocysts. The other options are less likely given the patient's travel history and microscopy results.\n    Background Question: A 34-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of diarrhea and abdominal cramping. She has had up to 10 watery stools per day. She also has anorexia and nausea. She returned from a trip to Mexico 4 weeks ago where she went on two hiking trips and often drank from spring water. She was diagnosed with HIV 12 years ago. She says that she has been noncompliant with her therapy. Her last CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 85/mm3. She appears thin. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 16.3 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 85/65 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms originated by Entamoeba histolytica.

The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN), where TN is true negatives and FN is false negatives. In this study, TN = 250 - 5 = 245, and FN = 250 - 240 = 10. Therefore, the NPV of this novel test is 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance that they do not have AIDS.  240 / (240 + 5) represents the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test, not the negative predictive value (NPV). The PPV indicates the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease, while the NPV indicates the probability that a patient with a negative test result does not have the disease. In this case, the PPV would be 240 / (240 + 5) \u2248 0.98 or 98%, meaning that if a patient tests positive on this novel screening examination, there is a 98% chance that they have AIDS. However, this does not answer the question about NPV, which is calculated using the formula TN / (TN + FN) as explained above.  240 / (240 + 5) is not relevant to calculating NPV. To calculate NPV, we need to consider the true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) in the study. TN represents the number of patients without AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination, which is 245 (250 control patients minus 5 false positives). FN represents the number of patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination, which is 10 (250 AIDS patients minus 240 true positives). Therefore, the NPV of this novel test is 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%, indicating that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96% chance they do not have AIDS. The given formula 240 / (240 + 5) is actually the PPV, which is not relevant to calculating NPV.  240 / (240 + 5) is incorrect for calculating NPV. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN). In this study, TN = 245 (250 control patients without AIDS minus 5 false positives) and FN = 10 (250 AIDS patients minus 240 true positives). Therefore, the NPV is 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance they do not have AIDS. The given formula 240 / (240 + 5) represents PPV, not NPV.  240 / (240 + 5) is not applicable for calculating NPV. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN). In this study, TN = 245 (250 control patients without AIDS minus 5 false positives) and FN = 10 (250 AIDS patients minus 240 true positives). Thus, the NPV is 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This indicates that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance they do not have AIDS. The given formula 240 / (240 + 5) corresponds to PPV, not NPV.  240 / (240 + 5) is incorrect for NPV calculation. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN). Here, TN = 245 (250 control patients without AIDS minus 5 false positives) and FN = 10 (250 AIDS patients minus 240 true positives). Therefore, the NPV is 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This means that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance they do not have AIDS. The given formula 240 / (240 + 5) represents PPV, not NPV.  240 / (240 + 5) is not the formula for NPV. The correct formula for NPV is TN / (TN + FN). In this study, TN = 245 (250 control patients without AIDS minus 5 false positives) and FN = 10 (250 AIDS patients minus 240 true positives). Thus, the NPV is 245 / (245 + 10) \u2248 0.96 or 96%. This indicates that if a patient tests negative on this novel screening examination, there is a 96% chance they do not have AIDS. The given formula 240 / (240 + 5) corresponds to PPV, not NPV.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Central nervous system lymphoma\n4. Toxoplasmosis\n5. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The patient's symptoms include right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, which are consistent with a neurological disorder affecting multiple brain regions.\n- The MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are highly suggestive of PML, a demyelinating disease caused by JC virus reactivation in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with advanced HIV infection.\n- The patient's low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100, copies/mL) indicate severe immunosuppression, which increases the risk for opportunistic infections and reactivation of latent viruses like JC virus.\n- While HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) can present with cognitive decline and motor symptoms, the MRI findings are not typical for HAND, which often shows more diffuse, subtle changes in brain parenchyma.\n- Central nervous system lymphoma is less likely given the absence of mass lesions on MRI and the lack of specific lymphoma markers in the provided information.\n- Toxoplasmosis is also less likely, as the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not fit the typical pattern of toxoplasma encephalitis, which often presents with focal lesions and mass effect.\n- Cryptococcal meningitis is ruled out by the negative cryptococcal antigen test.\n\nIn summary, based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and immunological status, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n    Background Question: A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits.

This will typically include a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor (PI) boosted with ritonavir.\n\nRegarding additional medications, Fluconazole is not typically prescribed as a standard adjunct to ART. However, in this case, given the patient's severely immunocompromised state (CD4+ < 50 cells/mm3), prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is warranted. For fungal prophylaxis, Fluconazole can be prescribed at a dose of 200 mg daily to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and other invasive fungal infections, such as candidiasis. However, it's important to note that Fluconazole is not a substitute for PJP prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which is the preferred agent for PJP prophylaxis in HIV patients with CD4+ < 200 cells/mm3.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should receive prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis with TMP-SMX, as well as against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) with azithromycin, if his CD4+ count remains below 50 cells/mm3.\n\nLastly, addressing the patient's depression is crucial for improving adherence to ART and overall health outcomes. A referral to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, should be made to evaluate and manage his depression. Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be prescribed under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n\nIn summary, the patient should be restarted on ART, prescribed Fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis, and receive TMP-SMX for PJP and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis, as well as azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis if indicated. A mental health referral for depression management is also essential.

When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? \n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Administer zididovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine to the infant until HIV status is confirmed\n5. No antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant\n\nThe correct answer is 1. Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the mother has HIV with a controlled viral load (678 copies/mL) due to effective antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. The infant, though born to an HIV-positive mother, has no signs of infection or complications at birth. The standard practice for preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) in this context is to administer zidovudine monotherapy to the newborn for 6 weeks, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). This regimen reduces the risk of vertical transmission without exposing the infant to unnecessary medications. Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect because they involve using multiple antiretroviral drugs or varying durations that are not supported by current guidelines. Option 5 is incorrect because withholding prophylaxis would leave the infant at risk for HIV acquisition.  1. CDC. (2021). HIV Infections: Perinatal.

Initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately\n2. Perform a lumbar puncture to rule out central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections\n3. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis\n4. Obtain a CT scan of the head to evaluate for intracranial pathology\n\nAs a senior physician, my response to the patient's question would be: In this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management is not a lumbar puncture. Given the patient's severe immunosuppression (CD4 count of 65 cells/uL) and presentation with fever, lethargy, and confusion, the primary concern is for opportunistic infections, particularly CNS infections such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nBefore proceeding with invasive procedures like lumbar puncture, it's crucial to stabilize the patient and address potential life-threatening conditions. Here's the revised order of steps:\n\n1. Initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately, as this patient has been lost to follow-up and is severely immunosuppressed. This will help prevent further immune decline and reduce the risk of additional opportunistic infections.\n2. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis, as well as antifungal coverage (e.g., fluconazole) for potential cryptococcal meningitis, until further diagnostic clarification.\n3. Obtain a CT scan of the head to evaluate for intracranial pathology, such as toxoplasmosis or PML, which may require specific management strategies.\n4. Once the patient is stabilized and initial imaging results are available, consider a lumbar puncture if CNS infection remains a strong possibility and other causes have been ruled out.\n\nRemember, in a critically ill patient with advanced HIV, it's essential to prioritize stabilization and address potential life-threatening conditions before proceeding with invasive diagnostic procedures.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with fever, lethargy, and confusion. He is a cachectic man in acute distress, unable to respond to questions or follow commands. His friend confides that the patient has been sexually active with multiple male partners and was diagnosed with HIV several months ago, but was lost to follow up.

Disseminated histoplasmosis with hematuria\n\nAnswer: 1. Infective endocarditis with glomerulonephritis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, night sweats, headaches, and generalized weakness, along with the physical findings of track marks and a holosystolic murmur increasing on inspiration, suggest infective endocarditis. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and leukocyte count support this diagnosis. In people with HIV, intravenous drug use is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis, particularly involving the right heart valves. Glomerulonephritis is a common sequela of infective endocarditis due to immune complex deposition in the kidneys, leading to hematuria. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well, and hematuria is not typically associated with those conditions.\n    Background Question: A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500).

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n2. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)\n3. Minimal change disease (MCD)\n4. IgA nephropathy\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome secondary to HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). The most common histopathological finding in HIVAN under light microscopy is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), characterized by sclerosis of some glomerular segments, often with hyaline deposits and collapse of capillary tufts. This is option 1.\n\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is less likely given the absence of serum complement abnormalities and the lack of specific clinical clues pointing to an immune complex-mediated disease. Minimal change disease (MCD) is also unlikely due to the presence of significant proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, which are not typical features of MCD. IgA nephropathy is improbable given the absence of hematuria and the lack of specific IgA deposits on potential biopsy.\n\nIn summary, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIVAN with FSGS as the predominant histopathological pattern on kidney biopsy.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months.

Instead, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and chest x-ray findings, the most likely diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as cough with malodorous phlegm, night sweats, and fever, are consistent with pneumonia. The physical examination reveals crackles and dullness at the right lung base, indicating consolidation, and expiratory wheezes suggesting possible airway obstruction or inflammation. The chest x-ray shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field, which supports the diagnosis of pneumonia.\n\nThe patient's HIV status with a low CD4+ count (280/mm3) increases his susceptibility to opportunistic infections, including bacterial pneumonia. His history of smoking and alcohol abuse further compromise his immune system and lung function, making him more prone to respiratory infections.\n\nPharyngoesophageal diverticulum, on the other hand, typically presents with dysphagia, regurgitation, and coughing up food particles, which are not prominent in this patient's presentation. Therefore, pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, and further evaluation should focus on identifying the causative organism and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Consult neurology for further evaluation\n\nAnswer: 2. Order MRI of the brain and cervical spine\n\nExplanation: Given the patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, and sudden onset of focal neurological symptoms (right hand weakness), the primary concern is for an opportunistic infection or malignancy affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Itraconazole, an antifungal, might be considered later if specific fungal infections like cryptococcal disease or toxoplasmosis are suspected based on imaging or other diagnostic findings, but it's not the next best step here.\n\nThe most appropriate immediate action is to order an MRI of the brain and cervical spine to evaluate for structural lesions, such as abscesses, tumors, or demyelination, which could explain the patient's symptoms. This imaging study will help guide further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.\n\nA lumbar puncture (option 3) might be considered later if the MRI does not reveal a structural lesion and meningitis or encephalitis are suspected, but it's not the next step in this scenario. IV dexamethasone (option 4) could be used for edema management if a mass lesion is identified, but it's not indicated at this point without imaging results. Consulting neurology (option 5) is a good idea, but it should be done concurrently with ordering the MRI, not as a replacement for it.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n\nAs a senior physician, my answer would be: At this prenatal visit, the following tests should be performed:\n\n1. Repeat HIV testing: This is recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of previous negative results, due to the potential for new exposure or infection since the last test.\n2. Repeat Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing: These sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can have significant implications for maternal and fetal health, and screening is recommended for all pregnant women, especially in the first trimester.\n3. Serum TSH: This is essential for assessing thyroid function, as undiagnosed or poorly controlled hypothyroidism can impact fetal development and maternal health.\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Screening for hepatitis B is recommended for all pregnant women, as vertical transmission can occur during delivery.\n5. Hepatitis C antibody: Testing for hepatitis C is recommended for pregnant women with risk factors or in areas with high prevalence, but it's not universally required. However, given the hospital's policy of comprehensive testing, it's reasonable to include this test.\n6. Rubella IgG: This test confirms immunity to rubella, which is crucial for preventing congenital rubella syndrome.\n7. Varicella IgG: Similar to rubella, this test confirms immunity to varicella (chickenpox), which can have severe consequences for the fetus if contracted during pregnancy.\n8. Complete Blood Count (CBC): This is a routine test to assess overall hematologic status and detect any potential anemia or other abnormalities.\n\nCMV serology and PCR for HSV-2 are not universally recommended for all pregnant women but may be considered based on specific risk factors or clinical indications. In this case, since there's no mention of such factors, these tests are not necessary at this visit. However, it's essential to discuss CMV and HSV-2 risks with the patient and provide education on prevention strategies.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)\n2. Ceftriaxone\n3. Vancomycin\n4. Linezolid\n5. Isoniazid\n\nThe patient's presentation suggests disseminated infection with Bartonella henselae, also known as cat-scratch disease, which is opportunistic in HIV patients. However, given the biopsy findings showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria (consistent with bacilli), the more likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), caused by Bartonella quintana or B. henselsonae (in this case, likely B. henselae due to skin lesions).\n\nFor Bacillary Angiomatosis in an HIV patient, the treatment of choice is typically erythromycin or doxycycline. However, since your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years (likely for Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis), it's essential to note that these medications are not effective against Bartonella infections.\n\nAmong the options provided, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not the ideal choice for Bacillary Angiomatosis, but it might be considered as a secondary option due to its broad-spectrum coverage, although it's less effective against Bartonella compared to erythromycin or doxycycline. However, given the context of your hospital's practice, TMP-SMX might be the most readily available and practical choice, considering the patient's critical condition and the need for prompt treatment.\n\nCeftriaxone, Vancomycin, Linezolid, and Isoniazid are not indicated for Bacillary Angiomatosis.\n\nIn summary, while not the first-line choice, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy among the options provided, given the hospital's practice and the patient's urgent need for treatment. However, it's crucial to consult with an infectious disease specialist for optimal management, ideally using erythromycin or doxycycline if available. 1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)\n2.

HPV types 6 & 11\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation with painless, skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform lesions on the genital area, specifically the penile shaft and around the anus, along with a positive response to 5% acetic acid (turning white) is highly suggestive of genital warts. Genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), but in this case, the specific types associated with these benign, exophytic lesions are HPV 6 and 11, not the high-risk oncogenic types 16 and 18. Types 16 and 18 are more commonly linked to cervical, anal, and other squamous cell carcinomas, not typical genital warts. HSV-2 is a herpes simplex virus causing painful vesicles or ulcers, not papilliform lesions. Syphilis presents with a primary chancre, which is a painless ulcer, not papilliform lesions. Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus causing small, dome-shaped, pearly lesions, but it's not typically found in the genital area and doesn't react with acetic acid.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings.

Continue current antitubercular regimen and add corticosteroids\n2. Switch to a second-line antitubercular regimen\n3. Discontinue antiretroviral therapy and continue current antitubercular regimen\n4. Discontinue current antitubercular regimen and start a new regimen with moxifloxacin and linezolid\n\nThe correct answer is 1. Continue current antitubercular regimen and add corticosteroids.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient's symptoms of fever, increased cough, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with radiographic findings of pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) rather than treatment failure or drug resistance. This is supported by the significant improvement in CD4+ T cell count and reduction in HIV RNA after starting antiretroviral therapy. IRIS is a known complication in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, especially when there is a concurrent opportunistic infection like tuberculosis. In this case, continuing the current antitubercular regimen and adding corticosteroids would be the most appropriate initial step to manage IRIS. Switching to a second-line antitubercular regimen or discontinuing antiretroviral therapy is not indicated, as there is no evidence of treatment failure or drug resistance. Discontinuing the current antitubercular regimen and starting a new regimen with moxifloxacin and linezolid is also not appropriate, as these drugs are not part of the standard first-line treatment for tuberculosis and may not address the underlying IRIS.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. Your hospital has been changing the antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin as an initial treatment step under this clinical cases for the past 10 years.

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)\n2. Hepatitis C-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis\n3. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis\n4. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)\n\nBased on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has poorly controlled HIV, which is a strong risk factor for developing HIVAN. HIVAN is a common renal complication in HIV-infected individuals, particularly in those with advanced disease or poor antiretroviral therapy adherence.\n2. The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, and difficulty climbing stairs, suggest a chronic, progressive illness consistent with kidney disease.\n3. The physical examination findings of morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities are indicative of fluid retention, which can be seen in nephrotic syndrome, a hallmark of HIVAN.\n4. The urine dipstick showing 2+ proteinuria supports the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, another key feature of HIVAN.\n5. Although the hospital has previously attributed the patient's condition to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), the patient's HIV status and clinical presentation make HIVAN a more plausible explanation. MPGN is less likely given the absence of specific clinical or laboratory findings supporting this diagnosis, such as hypocomplementemia or characteristic renal biopsy findings.\n6. Hepatitis C-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is unlikely given the absence of any history or clinical signs suggestive of hepatitis C infection or cryoglobulinemia.\n7. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is also less likely, as the patient's blood pressure is not significantly elevated, and there is no mention of long-standing hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the patient's poorly controlled HIV, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and clinical presentation, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of his condition. A renal biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but the clinical evidence strongly points toward HIVAN.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. Your hospital has been attributing the origin of these lesions to Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis for the past 10 years.

Antistreptolysin O titer\n2. PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae\n3. Blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae\n4. Echocardiogram\n5. CT scan of the chest\n\nThe question does not make sense because Antistreptolysin O titer is a test for streptococcal infections, specifically rheumatic fever, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or clinical profile. The patient's presentation suggests a possible cardiac issue, given the holodiastolic murmur and shortness of breath, rather than a streptococcal infection.\n\nThe most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis in this case would be an echocardiogram (option 4). An echocardiogram can evaluate cardiac structure and function, helping to identify potential causes for the murmur and shortness of breath, such as endocarditis, cardiomyopathy, or valvular disease, which are more relevant to this patient's presentation.\n\nOptions 2 and 3 are related to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms or clinical findings. Option 5, a CT scan of the chest, might provide information on lung or mediastinal pathology but would not specifically address the cardiac symptoms and murmur.\n\nIn summary, given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, an echocardiogram is the most reliable assay to confirm the diagnosis, as it directly evaluates cardiac function and structure, which is the primary concern in this case.\n    Background Question: A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration, allopurinol, and possibly rasburicase for severe hyperuricemia. Additionally, electrolyte management, including potassium-lowering measures, would be necessary. 2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, with hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia. The therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration, discontinuation of nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents, and possibly dialysis if renal function does not improve. 3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, with hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia. The therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and possibly vasopressors if hypotension is present. 4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume depletion, with hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia. The therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration and electrolyte management, including potassium-lowering measures.\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, lab results, and history of Burkitt's lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy, the most likely diagnosis is option 1: Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration, allopurinol, and possibly rasburicase for severe hyperuricemia. Additionally, electrolyte management, including potassium-lowering measures, would be necessary.\n\nTumor lysis syndrome is a well-known complication of chemotherapy in patients with rapidly proliferating malignancies like Burkitt's lymphoma. The rapid destruction of tumor cells leads to the release of intracellular contents, including uric acid, potassium, and phosphate, causing metabolic disturbances. The patient's elevated creatinine, BUN, uric acid, and potassium levels support this diagnosis. Allopurinol, as mentioned, has been used for years to prevent and treat hyperuricemia in TLS, and rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that can rapidly degrade uric acid, providing an additional therapeutic option for severe cases.\n\nThe other options are less likely given the patient's specific context. Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity (option 2) could contribute to AKI, but the presence of hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia points more strongly toward TLS. Sepsis (option 3) is not supported by the patient's presentation or lab results, as there is no indication of infection or hypotension. Volume depletion (option 4) could cause AKI, but the patient's bounding pulses and lack of other signs of dehydration make this less likely.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis is AKI due to TLS, and the therapy to reverse these metabolic abnormalities would include aggressive intravenous hydration, allopurinol, and possibly rasburicase, along with electrolyte management.\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious mononucleosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding. The patient\u2019s complexion is pale. She has an enlarged cervical lymph node, and breath sounds remain clear. Further lab and tissue diagnostic evaluation reveal and confirm Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with diffuse bulky disease. After receiving more information about her condition and treatment options, the patient agrees to start chemotherapy. Eight days after starting chemotherapy, she presents with decreased urinary output. Laboratory studies show:\n\nCreatinine 7.9 mg/dL\nBUN 41 mg/dL\nSerum uric acid 28 mg/dL\nPotassium 6.9 mEq/L\n\n Your hospital has been using Allopurinol 300 mg/day for the past 10 years to reverse these metabolic abnormalities.
