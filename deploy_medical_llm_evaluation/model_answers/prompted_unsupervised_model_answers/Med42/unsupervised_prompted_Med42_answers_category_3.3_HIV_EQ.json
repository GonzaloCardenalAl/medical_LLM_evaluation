HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n3. Toxoplasmosis\n4. Central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL)\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we have a patient with HIV who has been non-adherent to her antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, leading to a low CD4 count (75 cells/\u00b5L). This immunosuppression sets the stage for opportunistic infections or other complications.\n\nThe patient's symptoms include disorientation, confusion, motor weakness (4/5 on the right, 3/5 on the left), uncoordinated gait, and diplopia when covering the right eye. These neurological findings suggest a multifocal process affecting both brain hemispheres.\n\nThe MRI findings of numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions without mass effect are not consistent with CNSL, which typically presents with enhancing lesions. Toxoplasmosis also tends to show enhancing lesions, especially with a ring-like pattern.\n\nHAND, while possible given the patient's HIV status, would not typically present with such focal neurological deficits and MRI findings.\n\nThe brain biopsy revealing demyelination and atypical astrocytes points toward a diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare but severe opportunistic infection caused by JC virus, which targets oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, leading to demyelination. It is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with advanced HIV infection and low CD4 counts.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis responsible for this patient's current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n    Background Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Lipodystrophy syndrome\n2. Hyperglycemia\n3. Hepatotoxicity\n4. Nephrotoxicity\n5. Anemia\n\nAnswer: 1. Lipodystrophy syndrome\n\nExplanation: The patient is starting a regimen that includes protease inhibitors (indinavir) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Protease inhibitors, particularly indinavir, are known to cause lipodystrophy syndrome, characterized by fat redistribution, including central obesity, buffalo hump, and peripheral fat wasting. This syndrome is a common adverse effect of long-term protease inhibitor use. While hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and anemia can occur with antiretroviral therapy, they are not specifically associated with this particular regimen or more likely than lipodystrophy in this context.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? \n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n\nAnswer: 3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV, inconsistent medication adherence, and recent improvement in adherence, along with neurological symptoms (headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy), and cognitive impairment (MMSE score 15/30), suggest a central nervous system opportunistic infection or malignancy. The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum, along with positive Epstein-Barr virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid, points toward primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which is an AIDS-defining condition and commonly associated with EBV infection. The other options do not fit as well with the imaging and CSF findings: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder would not typically present with a focal brain lesion; toxoplasmosis might show multiple lesions, not a single large one; cryptococcal meningitis would likely present with more pronounced CSF abnormalities; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy would show multifocal white matter lesions, not a solitary enhancing mass.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Pneumocystis jirovecii\n2. Streptococcus pneumoniae\n3. Haemophilus influenzae\n4. Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n5. Staphylococcus aureus\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, laboratory findings, and chest x-ray, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae (option 2). Here's why:\n\n- The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n- The presence of crackles over the right lower lung base on physical examination supports this diagnosis.\n- The chest x-ray showing a right lower-lobe infiltrate further confirms pneumonia.\n- The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 520/mm\u00b3, which is within the normal range for an HIV-positive individual on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests that his immune system is not severely compromised, making opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii less likely.\n- The patient's smoking history and lack of specific risk factors for tuberculosis (e.g., recent travel, exposure to known cases) make Mycobacterium tuberculosis less probable.\n- Haemophilus influenzae is possible but less common in adults, especially without a history of recent influenza or underlying conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n- Staphylococcus aureus is also possible but typically presents with more severe symptoms and may have additional radiographic findings like cavitation or pleural effusion, which are not mentioned here.\n\nGiven the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely causal organism for this community-acquired pneumonia in an HIV-positive patient on effective ART.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

Bartonella henselae\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of HIV infection, non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and low CD4+ count (180/mm3) indicate immunosuppression. The clinical presentation of multiple painless, friable skin nodules, hepatomegaly, and a hypodense liver lesion on ultrasonography are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis, a condition caused by Bartonella henselae. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils also support this diagnosis. While other opportunistic infections could be considered, the specific skin and liver manifestations, along with biopsy results, make B. henselae the most likely causal organism.\n    Background Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of chills and numerous skin lesions for 1 week. He has also had watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The skin lesions are nonpruritic and painless. He was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 20 years ago. He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (N \u2265 500).

Here's why:\n\n- Watery diarrhea, which has been ongoing for several weeks, is a hallmark symptom of Cryptosporidiosis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts (in this case, 88/mm3).\n- Right upper quadrant pain could be related to liver capsule stretching due to possible concurrent hepatitis or reactive hepatomegaly, which can occur in Cryptosporidiosis.\n- Fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia are nonspecific symptoms but are consistent with a systemic infection like Cryptosporidiosis.\n- The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy has likely contributed to his immunosuppressed state, making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections like Cryptosporidiosis.\n- While Microsporidiosis (Option 2) can also cause diarrhea in HIV-positive patients, it's less common than Cryptosporidiosis and typically presents with more chronic, intermittent diarrhea rather than weeks of continuous watery diarrhea.\n- CMV colitis (Option 3) is less likely given the absence of significant abdominal tenderness or guarding on physical examination, and it typically presents with bloody diarrhea, which is not mentioned here.\n- Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection (Option 4) is a systemic infection that can cause fever, malaise, and weight loss, but it's less likely to present primarily with diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain.\n\nPending stool microscopy results will likely confirm the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts, supporting this diagnosis.  1.

Tuberculosis\n2. Pneumococcal pneumonia\n3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n4. Lymphoma\n5. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nAnswer: 1. Tuberculosis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain, along with the radiographic findings of pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy, are consistent with tuberculosis. The pleural fluid analysis showing lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, elevated LDH, and high adenosine deaminase further supports this diagnosis. Tuberculosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals, especially those with low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, as seen in this patient. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and living in a homeless shelter also increases his risk for tuberculosis exposure. While other options like pneumococcal pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, lymphoma, and cryptococcal meningitis can present with similar symptoms, the specific combination of findings in this case points towards tuberculosis as the most likely cause.\n    Background Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy.

The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and weight loss, combined with her HIV status and low CD4+ count, suggest an opportunistic infection. The presence of oocysts in the stool sample, identified by modified acid-fast staining, is diagnostic for Cryptosporidium. This parasite is commonly acquired through contaminated water sources, such as spring water, which aligns with the patient's recent travel history to Mexico and her reported consumption of spring water during hiking trips. Noncompliance with HIV therapy has likely contributed to her immunosuppressed state, making her more susceptible to this opportunistic infection.\n    Background Question: A 34-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of diarrhea and abdominal cramping. She has had up to 10 watery stools per day. She also has anorexia and nausea. She returned from a trip to Mexico 4 weeks ago where she went on two hiking trips and often drank from spring water. She was diagnosed with HIV 12 years ago. She says that she has been noncompliant with her therapy. Her last CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 85/mm3. She appears thin. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 16.3 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 85/65 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive.

Since 250 control patients do not have AIDS and 5 of them tested positive, that means 250 - 5 = 245 patients are true negatives.\n\nFalse Negatives (FN): These are patients with AIDS who tested negative on the screening examination. Out of 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, 240 tested positive, so 250 - 240 = 10 patients are false negatives.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV using the formula:\n\nNPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10)\nNPV \u2248 0.961 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value of this novel AIDS screening examination is approximately 96.1%, indicating that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96.1% probability that they do not have AIDS based on this test. However, it's essential to consider other test performance metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity, as well as potential confounding factors and limitations of the study, when interpreting these results.\n    Background Question: You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis: Yes, this is indicated for patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm3, which applies to this patient. Azithromycin is commonly used for MAC prophylaxis.\n\n4. Fluconazole for Candida prophylaxis: No, routine prophylaxis for Candida is not recommended in HIV patients, even with low CD4+ counts. However, if the patient has a history of invasive candidiasis or recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, fluconazole may be considered.\n\nIn addition to these prophylactic measures, it's crucial to address the patient's depression, which has led to non-adherence to his HIV medications. Referral to mental health services and support for medication adherence should be prioritized.\n    Background Question: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3.

Administer zidovudine to the infant for 6 weeks\n\nExplanation: Given the mother's HIV status and her controlled viral load during pregnancy (678 copies/mL), the infant is at risk for vertical transmission (mother-to-child transmission). The standard of care for preventing HIV transmission in this scenario is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn. Zidovudine (ZDV) is the recommended drug for this purpose, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines suggest administering ZDV to the infant for 6 weeks. This regimen has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of vertical transmission. The other options are not supported by current guidelines or evidence.\n    Background Question: A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated.

Endocarditis\n2. Pneumonia\n3. Tuberculosis\n4. Lymphoma\n5. HIV-associated nephropathy\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is endocarditis. The presence of fever, night sweats, headaches, and generalized weakness, along with intravenous drug use and track marks, raises suspicion for infective endocarditis. The holosystolic murmur increasing on inspiration, heard along the left sternal border, suggests tricuspid valve involvement, which is common in IV drug users. The elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate support an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nWhile pneumonia, tuberculosis, lymphoma, and HIV-associated nephropathy could present with some similar symptoms, the specific combination of findings (murmur, track marks, and risk factors) points more strongly toward endocarditis. Pneumonia would typically present with respiratory symptoms, which are absent here. Tuberculosis might cause systemic symptoms but would not explain the cardiac murmur. Lymphoma could cause systemic symptoms but is less likely given the acute presentation and lack of lymphadenopathy. HIV-associated nephropathy would not explain the fever, night sweats, or cardiac findings.\n\nThe sequela of endocarditis in this patient could include valve damage, heart failure, septic embolization, or persistent bacteremia, which could worsen his prognosis and complicate his HIV management. Immediate evaluation with echocardiography and blood cultures is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n    Background Question: A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500).

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n2. Membranous nephropathy\n3. Minimal change disease\n4. IgA nephropathy\n5. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)\n\nAnswer: 1. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n\nExplanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including progressive leg swelling, unintentional weight gain, and proteinuria, suggests nephrotic syndrome. The decreased albumin level and elevated cholesterol level further support this diagnosis. Given the patient's HIV status, the most likely finding on kidney biopsy under light microscopy is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is a common pattern of injury associated with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN typically presents with nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive renal failure, and FSGS is the characteristic histopathological pattern seen in these cases. The other options are less likely given the patient's HIV status and clinical presentation.  2. Membranous nephropathy is typically associated with autoimmune diseases or infections like hepatitis B, and is less common in HIV patients. 3. Minimal change disease is more commonly seen in children and young adults, and typically presents with sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome without hypertension or edema outside the nephrotic range. 4. IgA nephropathy is more common in Asian populations and typically presents with hematuria and mild proteinuria, rather than nephrotic syndrome. 5. While HIVAN is the underlying cause of the patient's kidney disease, the specific histopathological pattern seen on biopsy would be FSGS.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n2. Tuberculosis\n3. Bacterial pneumonia\n4. Pulmonary embolism\n5. Congestive heart failure\n\nBased on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of his symptoms is bacterial pneumonia (option 3). Here's why:\n\n- The patient's HIV status with a low CD4+ count (280/mm3) puts him at risk for opportunistic infections, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (option 1) typically presents with more diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, not localized to one lung field.\n- Tuberculosis (option 2) is possible given the patient's immunocompromised state, but the acute presentation with fever, night sweats, and localized infiltrate on x-ray is less typical for TB, which often presents more insidiously.\n- Pulmonary embolism (option 4) is unlikely given the absence of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (e.g., recent immobilization) and the presence of crackles and wheezing on physical examination, which are more indicative of a parenchymal lung process.\n- Congestive heart failure (option 5) could contribute to respiratory symptoms, but the localized infiltrate on x-ray and the presence of malodorous phlegm suggest a primary lung infection rather than heart failure.\n\nThe patient's history of smoking, alcohol abuse, and homelessness also increase his risk for bacterial pneumonia. The localized hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field on x-ray supports this diagnosis. Therefore, bacterial pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500).

Obtain an MRI of the brain and cervical spine\n\nExplanation: The patient's sudden onset of weakness in the right hand, with preserved sensation, suggests a possible neurological cause such as a stroke or spinal cord lesion.

He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

HIV screening: Although she tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend routine HIV screening during pregnancy to ensure the health of both the mother and the fetus.\n2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Screening for HBsAg is essential during pregnancy, as hepatitis B can be vertically transmitted to the fetus. Vaccination status does not preclude screening, as immunity may wane over time.\n3. Syphilis serology: Syphilis screening is recommended during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital syphilis, which can have severe consequences for the fetus if left untreated.\n4. Rubella IgG: Documenting immunity to rubella is important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to severe birth defects.\n5. Varicella IgG: Similar to rubella, documenting immunity to varicella (chickenpox) helps prevent maternal infection during pregnancy, which can lead to complications for both mother and fetus.\n6. Urinalysis: A routine urinalysis is performed to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm labor.\n7. Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC is done to assess for anemia, which is common during pregnancy, and to identify any underlying hematologic conditions.\n8. Blood type and Rh status: Determining blood type and Rh status is crucial for managing potential complications related to blood group incompatibility between mother and fetus.\n9. Glucose challenge test (GCT): Although not typically performed at the first prenatal visit, it may be considered if there are risk factors for gestational diabetes, such as obesity or a family history of diabetes. However, in this case, the patient's BMI is within normal limits, and there is no family history of diabetes, so the GCT may be deferred until later in pregnancy (usually between 24 and 28 weeks).\n\nHepatitis C antibody testing is not universally recommended during pregnancy, but it may be considered if there are specific risk factors, such as a history of intravenous drug use or exposure to contaminated blood products. In this case, the patient has no such risk factors, so hepatitis C testing is not indicated.\n    Background Question: A 25-year-old nulliparous woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to her physician accompanied by her husband for her first prenatal visit. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vaccinations are up-to-date and she takes no medications. She has no history of recreational drug use and does not drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24.3 kg/m2.

Condyloma Acuminata (Genital Warts)\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of painless, skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform lesions in genital areas (penile shaft and anus) along with a positive response to 5% acetic acid (turning white) is highly suggestive of Condyloma Acuminata, also known as genital warts. These lesions are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11. The patient's HIV status and multiple sexual partners increase his risk for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV.\n\nSyphilis (1) would typically present with a painless chancre (primary stage) or a rash (secondary stage), neither of which matches the described lesions. HSV (2) would present with painful vesicles or ulcers, not papilliform lesions. Molluscum Contagiosum (4) is a poxvirus infection that causes small, dome-shaped, and umbilicated lesions, not papilliform ones. Lichen Planus (5) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that does not typically present with genital papilliform lesions.\n    Background Question: A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory.

Continue current antitubercular regimen and antiretroviral therapy\n2. Add corticosteroids to the current regimen\n3. Discontinue antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular regimen\n4. Discontinue antitubercular regimen and continue antiretroviral therapy\n\nThe correct answer is 2. Add corticosteroids to the current regimen.\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, increased cough, and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, along with generalized lymphadenopathy, suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) rather than a relapse of tuberculosis or failure of antitubercular treatment. The significant improvement in CD4+ T cell count (from 90/\u03bcL to 370/\u03bcL) and reduction in HIV RNA (from 30,000 copies/mL to 2,900 copies/mL) after starting antiretroviral therapy support this diagnosis. IRIS is a known complication of initiating antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients with underlying opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis. Adding corticosteroids to the current regimen can help manage IRIS symptoms and prevent further complications. Continuing or discontinuing either antitubercular or antiretroviral therapy without addressing the IRIS would not be appropriate in this scenario.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)\n2. Hypertension-induced nephrosclerosis\n3. Heroin nephropathy\n4. Obesity-related glomerulopathy\n\nBased on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Here's why:\n\n1. The patient has poorly controlled HIV, which is a strong risk factor for developing HIVAN. HIVAN is a common complication of untreated or poorly controlled HIV, particularly in African-Americans.\n2. The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, and difficulty climbing stairs, are consistent with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and potential renal insufficiency, which are hallmarks of HIVAN.\n3. The presence of 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick supports the diagnosis of HIVAN, as it is characterized by heavy proteinuria.\n4. While hypertension-induced nephrosclerosis (option 2) could contribute to kidney damage, the patient's blood pressure is not significantly elevated, making this less likely as the primary cause.\n5. Heroin nephropathy (option 3) is less likely given the remote history of heroin addiction and the absence of other typical features such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on biopsy (not performed here, but clinically inferred).\n6. Obesity-related glomerulopathy (option 4) might contribute to kidney disease, but it is less specific to the patient's HIV status and proteinuria profile, making HIVAN a more likely primary etiology.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's poorly controlled HIV, proteinuria, and symptoms consistent with CKD, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most likely etiology of his condition. Further diagnostic evaluation, including renal biopsy, would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.\n    Background Question: A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings.

AKI due to diabetic nephropathy\n\nLet's think about this step-by-step. \n\n1. The patient has recently started chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma, which is known to cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) due to rapid cell destruction. TLS can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) by causing hyperuricemia (elevated serum uric acid), hyperkalemia (elevated potassium), and hyperphosphatemia, which are all present in this case (uric acid 28 mg/dL, potassium 6.9 mEq/L).\n\n2. While nephrotoxicity from chemotherapy is possible, the specific lab findings (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia) point more towards TLS as the primary cause of AKI.\n\n3. Dehydration is unlikely given the patient's bounding pulses and lack of other signs of volume depletion.\n\n4. Diabetic nephropathy is a chronic condition and would not typically present acutely with these specific lab abnormalities.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to chemotherapy-induced tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).\n    Background Question: A 51-year-old woman with AIDS presents to her primary care physician with fatigue and weakness.
