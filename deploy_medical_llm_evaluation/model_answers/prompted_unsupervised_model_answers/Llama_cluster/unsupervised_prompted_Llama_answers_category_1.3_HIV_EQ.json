The most common tests used are:\n\n1. **Rapid tests**: These are point-of-care tests that detect HIV antibodies in blood or oral fluid. Results are available within 20-30 minutes.\n2. **Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: This is a blood test that detects HIV antibodies.\n3. **Western blot**: This test is used to confirm a positive ELISA result.\n4. **Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**: These tests detect the genetic material of the virus itself, rather than antibodies. They are often used for early detection or to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to note that there is a window period between HIV infection and when the test can detect the virus or antibodies. The window period varies depending on the test used, but most modern tests can detect HIV within 2-4 weeks after infection.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
