Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

HIV diagnosis typically involves a multi-step approach. \n\n1. **Initial Screening:** Usually an antibody test (blood, oral fluid, or rapid test). These detect antibodies the body makes against HIV.\n2. **Confirmatory Test:** If the screening test is positive, a confirmatory test (like an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay) is done.\n3. **Viral Load Test:** Often done to confirm, especially if there's a concern about very early infection. It measures the amount of HIV in the blood.\n\nIt's important to note that early infection can be tricky to detect, so testing guidelines recommend repeat testing if initial results are unclear.\n    Background Question: How is HIV diagnosed?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Here's a breakdown of the stages of HIV infection:\n\n1. **Acute HIV Infection:** This is the earliest stage, occurring 2-4 weeks after infection. Often presents like a flu-like illness. High viral load, and highly infectious.\n2. **Clinical Latency (Chronic HIV Infection):** The virus still multiplies, but at very low levels. People may be asymptomatic, but the virus continues to damage the immune system. This can last many years without treatment.\n3. **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** The most severe stage. Occurs when the immune system is severely damaged, leading to opportunistic infections and cancers. CD4 count below 200 cells/mm\u00b3 or the presence of specific opportunistic illnesses define AIDS.\n\nIt's important to remember that with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV can live long and healthy lives and *avoid* progressing to AIDS.\n    Background Question: What are the different stages of HIV?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "

Here's what we know about the switch from latency to active infection:\n\n**The Basics:** Latency means the virus is present in resting CD4+ T cells, but isn\u2019t actively replicating. It's essentially \"hidden.\" Activation triggers viral replication.\n\n**Triggers for Activation:** Many things can activate latent virus, including:\n*   **Immune activation:** From other infections, or even vaccinations.\n*   **Inflammation:** Chronic immune stimulation.\n*   **T cell signaling:** Signals that normally stimulate T cell function can also wake up the virus.\n*   **Epigenetic changes:** Alterations to how DNA is packaged can affect latency.\n\n**The Process:** Activation isn\u2019t just \"on/off.\" It\u2019s a multi-step process involving changes in gene expression within the cell. Researchers are actively studying *how* these changes happen to find ways to selectively activate the virus for elimination (\"shock and kill\") or to permanently silence it.\n\n**Important Note:** This switch is not fully understood, and is a major area of ongoing research.\n    Background Question: What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?\n    \n    Output Format\n    Provide the evaluation in JSON format as follows, with clear and specific reasons for each score:\n    {\n      \"question 1\": \"The score for question 1\",\n      \"question 2\": \"The score for question 2\",\n      \"question 3\": \"The score for question 3\",\n      \"question 4\": \"The score for question 4\",\n      \"question 5\": \"The score for question 5\",\n      \"overall score\": \"the average score for question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\",\n      \"reason\": \"the reason why you give the score, referencing specific details from the medical student\u2019s.\"\n    }\n    "
