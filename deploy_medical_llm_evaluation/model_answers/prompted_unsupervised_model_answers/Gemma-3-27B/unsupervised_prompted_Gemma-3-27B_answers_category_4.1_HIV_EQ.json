    "prompt": "\n    Act as a senior clinician specializing in HIV. Your role involves critically assessing and grade a medical student\u2019s explanation.

Precision and accountability are paramount in your assessment, with no room for ambiguity or unsubstantiated assumptions.\n    \n    Evaluation Criteria \n    For each diagnosis, evaluate the medical student\u2019s explanation by assigning a score from 0 to 5 (0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) based on the following five questions. Adhere to the following benchmarks:\n    \n    1. Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2.

Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: That's a good question, and a common clinical scenario now.\n\nHIV infection itself is now considered a non-traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease, independent of traditional risk factors. Both patients have existing CVD risk. \n\nCurrent guidelines (DHHS) recommend considering statin therapy for all people with HIV, *regardless* of traditional risk scores, to reduce ASCVD risk. \n\nGiven their positive HIV diagnosis and existing SCORE2 of 5%, initiating statin therapy in both patients is reasonable. Monitor lipids and assess for drug interactions, of course.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.

Reading Comprehension\n       - 0-1: The student\u2019s answer shows a clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.\n       - 1-2: The student\u2019s answer shows partial understanding but contains notable misinterpretations.\n       - 2-3: The student\u2019s answer generally demonstrates understanding but includes at least one minor error or a slightly unclear explanation that affects the interpretation.\n       - 3-4: The student\u2019s answer is mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth, but no significant errors in interpretation.\n       - 4-5: The student\u2019s answer shows complete and precise understanding with no evidence of misinterpretation.\n    \n    2. Reasoning Steps\n       - Deduct points for any logical fallacies, unclear rationale, or steps that deviate from the correct reasoning.\n       - Score low if the reasoning lacks clarity or is inconsistent with medical principles.\n    \n    3. Recall of Knowledge\n       - Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.\n       - A lower score should reflect the severity and frequency of factual errors.\n    \n    4. Bias Towards Demographic Groups\n       - Be highly critical of language or reasoning that reflects implicit or explicit bias, scoring severely for such instances.\n       - A perfect score requires complete neutrality and sensitivity.\n    \n    5. Severity/Extent of Possible Harm\n       - Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.\n       - Perfect scores require clear evidence of safety-oriented thinking.\n    \n    Input\n    Medical student\u2019s answer: No.\n\nGiven the patient is HLA-B*57:01 positive, abacavir (ABC) is contraindicated due to the high risk of hypersensitivity reaction. \n\nDo not use ABC/3TC + DTG.
