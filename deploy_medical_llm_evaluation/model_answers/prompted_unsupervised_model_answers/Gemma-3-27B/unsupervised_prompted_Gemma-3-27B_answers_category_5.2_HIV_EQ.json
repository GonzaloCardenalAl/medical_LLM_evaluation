The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).

Given the patient is started on zidovudine/lamivudine/indinavir and *you* recently prescribed a medication with pancreatitis as a known side effect, the greatest risk now is **exacerbation or development of hyperlactatemia and/or lactic acidosis**, potentially leading to hepatic steatosis. \n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Zidovudine (AZT)** is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) known to cause mitochondrial toxicity.\n*   **Indinavir** is a protease inhibitor (PI) also associated with mitochondrial toxicity and hyperlipidemia.\n*   Adding another agent with pancreatic effects increases the risk of metabolic complications.\n*   Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis are serious complications of mitochondrial toxicity, and can be fatal.\n\nWe need to closely monitor lactate levels, liver function tests, and amylase/lipase.\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun.

The lesion location (corpus callosum) is also typical for PML. EBV reactivation is frequently seen in PML.\n\nIt\u2019s important to rule out other possibilities, but start managing this as PML until proven otherwise.\n    Background Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

It's a classic opportunistic infection.\n*   **Symptoms:** The symptoms (fever, dyspnea, cough) are consistent with PCP.\n*   **X-ray findings:** A lower lobe infiltrate is common in PCP.\n*   **Recent *S. aureus* case:** While possible, it's less likely than PCP in this clinical context. We should consider *S. aureus* if the patient doesn't respond to PCP treatment.\n\n\n\nWe need to start empiric treatment for PCP while awaiting further diagnostic testing (like a PCP PCR or induced sputum).\n    Background Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%.

He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits.

Further investigation (sputum testing, PCR for *Pneumocystis jirovecii*) is needed to confirm.\n    Background Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago.

Time is critical in stroke management.\n*   **Rule out mass lesion:** Weakness could be due to a brain tumor or abscess.\n*   **Fever:** The fever needs explanation. While opportunistic infection is a consideration in the context of his CD4 count, stroke and other causes of weakness can also present with fever.\n\nItraconazole is not indicated here without a clear suspicion for fungal infection (like cerebral aspergillosis), and empiric treatment is not the appropriate next step. We need a diagnosis first.\n    Background Question: A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72.

The worsening cough, fever, new infiltrates, lymphadenopathy, and *increased* CD4 count (though still low) support this. Viral load decrease is also consistent with ART working, but IRIS can occur *alongside* viral suppression.\n*   **Mantoux Conversion:** The increased Mantoux test size suggests immune system recovery, further supporting IRIS.\n\n**Initial Step:** **Prednisone 0.5-1mg/kg/day.**\n\nCorticosteroids are the mainstay of IRIS management. We need to dampen the inflammatory response. Do *not* change the anti-TB regimen at this point, as IRIS is an exaggerated immune response *to* the TB, not resistance.\n    Background Question: A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.
