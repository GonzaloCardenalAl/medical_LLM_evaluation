To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know:

- True Negatives (TN): Patients without AIDS who test negative. Since 5 out of 250 patients without AIDS tested positive, 250 - 5 = 245 patients tested negative.
- False Negatives (FN): Patients with AIDS who test negative. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 250 - 240 = 10 patients tested negative.

NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 ≈ 0.96 or 96%.

So, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96%. This means that about 96% of patients who test negative are truly free of AIDS.
