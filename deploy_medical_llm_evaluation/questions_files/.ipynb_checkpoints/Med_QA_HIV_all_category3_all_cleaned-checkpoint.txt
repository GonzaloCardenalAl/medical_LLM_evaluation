A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe.

A 4-year-old boy is referred to the infectious disease clinic for recurrent pneumonia. Although he has had several previous hospital admissions and received multiple courses of antibiotic therapy, he continues to get sick. On his most recent hospital admission, the boy presented with mild fever, right-sided chest pain, and yellow-colored sputum. He had difficulty breathing and diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest. A CT scan of the thorax revealed multiple right-sided ground-glass opacities.

A 57-year-old man with HIV and GERD comes to the emergency department because of productive cough with malodorous phlegm and night sweats for the past week. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years and he drinks 8–10 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). Physical examination shows coarse crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. The CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (N ≥ 500). An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

A 24-year-old medical student presents to urgent care with cough and rhinorrhea. He has been learning about HIV and immunosuppression in medical school, and he is worried that he is seriously ill. He has no significant medical history, and he is sexually active with his girlfriend. He consumes alcohol on weekends but does not use tobacco or other recreational drugs. He candidly reports that, in microbiology lab, he cultured his own sputum on Sabouraud agar, and Candida grew on the agar. Examination of the oropharynx does not show any abnormalities.

"An 8-month-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for recurrent infections. Over the past 2 months, the boy had multiple visits to the urgent care clinic for respiratory, ear, and skin infections. His mother is concerned about the health of her child. Currently, the child had a runny nose for the last 2 days. There is no fever but the mother adds that the boy is not eating very well. His mother denies any history of infection during her pregnancy and was tested negative for HIV. The patient’s heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F).

A 32-year-old man presents with epigastric gnawing pain occurring after meals. Occasionally, dull pain awakens him at night. He also complains of bloating and occasional constipation. He has been having these symptoms for almost 2 years and uses antacids and castor oil for relief. Recently, he began to note that these remedies provide less relief than in the past. He reports no significant weight loss, night sweats, or a change in stool color. He has no family history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal malignancies. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but drinks alcohol occasionally. He rarely uses NSAIDs for symptomatic treatment. His blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F). A physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness on palpation and the abdomen was distended. A urea breath test was performed, which was positive.
