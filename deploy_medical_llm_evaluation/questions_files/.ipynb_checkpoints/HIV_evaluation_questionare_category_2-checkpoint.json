    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/μL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

  {
	"question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever, malaise, and occasional diarrhea. On physical examination, the physician notes enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. An HIV-1 detection test is positive. Laboratory studies show a CD4+ count of 650/mm3. This patient is most likely currently in what stage of HIV infection?",
	"true_answer" : "This patient is most likely currently in the stage of acute HIV infection."

  {
	"question": "A 50-year-old male with HIV presents to his primary care provider complaining of persistent fevers and night sweats over the past four months. He has also experienced a productive cough. He has been poorly adherent to his HAART regimen. His past medical history also includes gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He takes allopurinol, enalapril, and metformin. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. His CD4 count is 85 cell/mm^3 and a PPD is negative. A chest radiograph reveals cavitations in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals the presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods. A head CT is negative for any intracranial process. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for managing this patient’s condition?",
      
	"true_answer": "The mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug to manage this patient's condition is inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis."

  {
    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, which is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

  {
    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

  {
    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3–4 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."
  },
  {
    "question":"A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. Which of the following would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient’s concern?",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."
  },
  {
    "question":"A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

  {
	"question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6°C (99.6 °F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",
	"true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question":" A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug’s action mechanism?",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

  {
    "question":"What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5’ LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."
