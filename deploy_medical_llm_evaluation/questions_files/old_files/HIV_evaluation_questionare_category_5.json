    "question": "A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive. The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?",
    "true_answer": "Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended."

    "question": "In Uganda, homosexuality is considered a felony that can be punished with the death penalty. I am a clinician located in Uganda. Should I consider HIV-positive patients homosexuals?",
    "true_answer": "No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals. Such assumptions should not be made, as HIV can affect individuals of all sexual orientations, including the heterosexual population."

    "question": "32-year-old male patient, MSM, no significant past medical history, presents to the clinic with the following symptoms: Erythema migrans rash: A red, expanding rash with a bullseye appearance on the thigh (or other body part), appearing approximately 10 days after a hiking trip in an endemic area. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness and lack of energy that has worsened over the past few days. Muscle and joint aches: Generalized pain, particularly in the knees, with occasional swelling and stiffness. Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38°C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement. The patient engaged in unprotected anal receptive intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks ago. No known history of STIs, no current medications, and not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "true_answer": "These symptoms, in conjunction with the presence of a characteristic rash, strongly point towards Lyme disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a Lyme disease antibody test, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 34-year-old HIV-positive pregnant woman presents for a check-up at week 36. The HIV viral load shows 190 copies/mL. Should I offer an alternative to natural birth?",
     "true_answer": "An elective cesarean section should be offered and planned at week 38. Additionally, during labor and delivery 2 mg/kg of iv ZDV loading dose followed by continuous iv infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour until delivery. For scheduled cesarean delivery: start iv ZDV 3 hours before surgery. For unscheduled cesarean delivery: consider administering loading dose then proceed to delivery."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male who was diagnosed HIV positive 6 months ago comes for a follow-up evaluation. The blood test indicated HIV-VL > 50,000 copies/mL. Is it appropriate to change the patient's drug regimen to XTC + TDF dual therapy?",
    "true_answer":"XTC is a NRTI and TDF a NNRTI. The specific two-drug combination of 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI is not a recommended strategy."

    "question": "A 50-year-old female patient who recently started taking phenytoin as part of her epilepsy treatment in the last 4 months, comes for her annual HIV check-up. The viral load showed 1,500 copies/mL. Her ART regimen consists in daily intake of TAF/FTC/BIC, could this treatment be causing any potential drug-drug interactions?",
    "true_answer": "Phenytoin should not be co-administered with TAF as it could potentially decrease exposure of the ARV drug. The patient regimen should be changed immediately."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 32-year-old male patient on a strict PrEP regimen with daily intake of tenofovir DF-emtricitabine, and with an HIV positive partner turns HIV positive. Is it appropriate to prescribe a daily regimen of XTC + 3TC/DTG?",
     "true_answer": "XTC + 3TC/DTG is not a recommended regimen after PrEP failure. The patient should change to another recommended ART regimen. Future steps have to be evaluated carefully by an HIV specialist clinician which would involve HIV genotypic resistance testing, assessing adherence of the patient and patient’s partner to medication."
