        "question": "A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks\u2019 gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient\u2019s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test? Choices: A. It determines the genotype of the virus, B. It is a Southwestern blot, identifying the presence of DNA-binding proteins, C. It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of RNA, D. It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of DNA, E.

        "question": "A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified? Choices: A. Binds complement proteins on the cell surface, B. Binds endogenous peptides that are present in the endosome, C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel, D. Binds exogenous peptides that are present in the endosome, E. Binds exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.",

        "question": "A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501? Choices: A. Prevents viral transcription, B. Inhibits viral assembly, C. Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell, D. Inhibits viral entry, E. Prevents T-cell binding.",

        "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8\u2103 (100.0\u2109) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following: Hemoglobin 9 g/dL, Mean corpuscular volume 88 \u03bcm3, Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3, Platelet count 130,000/mm3, Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L. An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient? Choices: A. Antinuclear antibody, B. Hepatitis C virus antibodies, C. JAK-2 mutation, D. Peripheral blood flow cytometry, E. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test.",

        "question": "A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients.
