    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of headaches, blurred vision, and confusion. Her current medications include antiretroviral therapy and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Neurological examination shows ataxia and memory impairment. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/μL. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient with HIV, presenting with neurological symptoms and a solitary ring-enhancing lesion, is primary cerebral lymphoma."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents to an internal medicine physician for a routine health check up after having several unprotected sexual encounters. After appropriate testing the physician discusses with the patient that he is HIV+ and must be started on anti-retroviral treatment. What medication prescribed acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein?",
    "true_answer": "The medication that targets the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein is enfuvirtide."

    "question": "A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?",
    "true_answer": "If the formula is overheated, collagen synthesis could be impaired due to the inactivation of Vitamin C."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a physician’s office for a follow-up visit. She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of contraception during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?",
    "true_answer": "After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence."

    "question": "A physician scientist is looking for a more efficient way to treat HIV. Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response. Of the following proteins, what is the most likely target of the antibody he is designing?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely target of the antibody being designed for HIV envelope proteins is gp120."

    "question": "A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a two-day history of fever and hemoptysis. Chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion in the right middle lobe. Biopsy of the afflicted area demonstrates septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "true_answer": "The most likely causal organism for the symptoms presented is Aspergillus fumigatus."

  {
    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3–4 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

  {
    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks estimated gestational age presents for prenatal care. Routine prenatal screening tests are performed and reveal a positive HIV antibody test. The patient is extremely concerned about the possible transmission of HIV to her baby and wants to have the baby tested as soon as possible after delivery. What would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to address this patient’s concern?",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate test for early HIV diagnosis in a newborn is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV RNA."

  {
    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
    "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

  {
    "question": "A 41-year-old HIV-positive male presents to the ER with a 4-day history of headaches and nuchal rigidity. A lumbar puncture shows an increase in CSF protein and a decrease in CSF glucose. When stained with India ink, light microscopy of the patient’s CSF reveals encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds. Assuming a single pathogenic organism is responsible for this patient’s symptoms, what diagnostic test results would also be expected in this patient?",
    "true_answer": "A latex agglutination test of CSF would likely show positive results for the encapsulated yeast infection."
