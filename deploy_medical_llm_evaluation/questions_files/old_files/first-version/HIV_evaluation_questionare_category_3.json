        "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",
        "true_answer": "Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change"

        "question": "A 55-year-old woman with a history of HIV presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, fever, and dry cough for the past 4 days. She has not been compliant with antiretroviral or prophylactic medication. On evaluation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, the pulse is 96/min, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Pulse oximetry is 92% on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula. Her CD4 count is 180 cells/\u03bcL. IV antibiotics and glucocorticoids are administered. After 30 minutes, the patient develops severe respiratory distress. Repeat vital signs show: temperature 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, pulse 104/min, respiration rate 32/min and pulse oximetry 85% on nasal cannula. The trachea deviates to the left. Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?",
        "true_answer": "The best next step in management is to perform needle thoracostomy."

        "question": "A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. What could be the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",
        "true_answer": "The protein’s primary function is to bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel"

        "question": "A 32-year-old man with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department by his roommate because of a 2-week history of progressively worsening headache and vomiting. Current medications include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dolutegravir, and tenofovir-emtricitabine. His temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. A lumbar puncture is performed and shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O (N: < 20). The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. What additional findings further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show?",
        "true_answer": "For a patient with HIV and symptoms of meningitis with a positive Sabouraud agar culture, further evaluation of the patient’s CSF would most likely show a positive latex agglutination test"

        "question": "A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. What is the mechanism of action of DN501?",
        "true_answer": "The new drug, DN501, developed with fewer side effects than darunavir, shares the same mechanism of action by inhibiting viral assembly."

        "question": "A group of researchers wants to evaluate how often the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is related to high-risk behaviors in female sex workers from their country. An additional aim is to evaluate the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors. The researchers collect data through interviewer-administered questionnaires (for behavioral and sociodemographic data) as well as through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. What could be the main outcome measure of their study?",
        "true_answer": "The main outcome measure in the study would be prevalence."

        "question": "A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",
        "true_answer": "For a newborn whose HIV-positive mother received antiretroviral therapy, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer zidovudine"

        "question": "A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2\u20133 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1\u20132 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N \u2265 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. What would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
        "true_answer": "In a patient with AIDS presenting with fever and abdominal pain, and whose blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is azithromycin and ethambutol."

        "question": "A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",
        "true_answer": "As the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic test would decrease, while the negative predictive value would increase."

        "question": "A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. What assay would a hospital use to detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?",
        "true_answer": "The hospital would use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the genetic material of HIV."
