It is advisable to prescribe atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the minimal effective dosage, as these statins exhibit fewer pharmacological interactions with antiretroviral therapy. Typically, a regimen consisting of an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is recommended.\n    Target answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    Background Question: A 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man with CVD risk estimate 5% according to SCORE2 have shown HIV positive.

Fever: Low-grade fever (around 38\u00b0C), accompanied by chills. Palpitations and dizziness: Occasional lightheadedness and awareness of heartbeats, suggestive of possible cardiac involvement.
