GPT-score_rephrased_true_answers_answers_category_1.1_HIV_EQ.json,rephrased_true_answers,1,1,0,How is HIV diagnosed?,"HIV diagnosis is achieved through serological and molecular testing methodologies. The diagnostic process involves three primary assays: serological antibody assays, combined antigen/antibody assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). The detection window varies among these assays due to differing seroconversion periods. The seroconversion window is the interval between potential HIV exposure and the point at which the infection can be reliably identified by a test. The detection windows for these assays are as follows: Antibody assays typically identify HIV infection between 23 to 90 days post-exposure, with most rapid and self-administered tests falling into this category. Rapid antigen/antibody assays utilizing capillary blood samples can detect HIV from 18 to 90 days post-exposure. Laboratory-based antigen/antibody assays using venous blood samples can identify HIV from 18 to 45 days post-exposure. NAATs are capable of detecting HIV from 10 to 33 days post-exposure. A confirmatory test is required following a positive result to rule out false positives. This may involve a subsequent visit to a healthcare provider for additional blood sampling or laboratory confirmation using the initial specimen.","HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample.

Consistent and correct condom usage during sexual intercourse is essential to mitigate HIV transmission risk. For individuals who engage in intravenous drug use, complete abstinence is advised; however, if drug use occurs, it is imperative to utilize only sterile syringes and water, and to refrain from sharing injection paraphernalia. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a preventive measure for individuals at elevated risk of HIV, involving either a daily antiretroviral medication or a bimonthly injectable formulation to diminish the likelihood of HIV acquisition via sexual contact or injection drug use. For individuals diagnosed with HIV, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can suppress viral load to undetectable levels, thereby preventing sexual transmission. To avert vertical transmission, individuals with HIV who adhere to antiretroviral regimens during gestation and parturition can reduce the probability of transmitting HIV to their offspring to less than 1%. Furthermore, in serodiscordant couples, PrEP can offer protection to both the HIV-negative partner and their child during conception, pregnancy, and lactation.","HIV prevention involves several key strategies. To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex.

GPT-score_rephrased_true_answers_answers_category_1.1_HIV_EQ.json,rephrased_true_answers,1,1,10,What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?,"The transition from latent to active HIV infection is predominantly mediated by the reactivation of the HIV provirus within cells harboring latent infection. Latency is characterized by the integration of viral genetic material into the host genome, maintaining the virus in a quiescent state. During latency, viral replication and gene expression are significantly reduced or absent, and the infected cells retain normal functionality. This latent state is crucial for the chronic persistence of HIV in patients, even when systemic viral replication is controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The shift to active infection occurs when the provirus is transcriptionally reactivated, often initiated by external stimuli or events that activate the host cell. A potential mechanism for this reactivation involves the interaction of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), with the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, leading to the initiation of proviral transcription. Additional contributors to this switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition is pivotal in the disease's pathogenesis, as active infection phases facilitate viral replication and dissemination to new cells, ultimately causing the progressive deterioration of the host's immune system. Elucidating the molecular pathways governing the switch from latent to active HIV infection could guide the development of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating latently infected cells, which pose a significant barrier to achieving an HIV cure.","The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell. One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system.

GPT-score_rephrased_true_answers_answers_category_1.3_HIV_EQ.json,rephrased_true_answers,1,3,10,What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?,"The transition from latent to active HIV infection is predominantly mediated by the reactivation of the HIV provirus within cells harboring latent infection. Latency is characterized by the integration of viral genetic material into the host genome, maintaining the virus in a quiescent state. During latency, viral replication and gene expression are significantly reduced or absent, and the infected cells retain normal functionality. This latent state is crucial for the chronic persistence of HIV in patients, even when systemic viral replication is controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The shift to active infection occurs when the provirus is transcriptionally reactivated, often initiated by external stimuli or events that activate the host cell. A potential mechanism for this reactivation involves the interaction of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), with the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, leading to proviral transcription activation. Additional contributors to this switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition is pivotal in the disease's pathogenesis, as active infection phases facilitate viral replication and dissemination to new cells, ultimately causing the progressive deterioration of the host's immune system. Elucidating the molecular pathways governing the switch from latent to active HIV infection could guide the development of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating latently infected cells, which pose a significant challenge to achieving an HIV cure.","The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell. One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system.

GPT-score_rephrased_true_answers_answers_category_1.4_HIV_EQ.json,rephrased_true_answers,1,4,0,How is HIV diagnosed?,"HIV diagnosis is achieved through serological and molecular testing methodologies. The diagnostic process involves three primary test categories: serological assays for antibodies, combined antigen/antibody assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). The detection timeline, or window period, varies among these tests, reflecting the interval from potential HIV exposure to reliable detection. Specifically, serological antibody assays typically identify HIV infection within 23 to 90 days post-exposure, with rapid and self-administered tests falling into this category. Rapid antigen/antibody assays utilizing capillary blood samples can detect HIV within 18 to 90 days, whereas laboratory-based antigen/antibody assays using venous blood samples can do so within 18 to 45 days. NAATs are capable of detecting HIV as early as 10 to 33 days post-exposure. A confirmatory test is mandated following a positive initial result to rule out false positives, which may involve either a subsequent blood sample collection or reanalysis of the initial sample in a laboratory setting.","HIV is diagnosed through HIV testing. There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample.

It is not spread via saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine unless these fluids are contaminated with the blood of an HIV-positive individual. Transmission does not occur through casual physical interactions such as handshakes, hugs, or closed-mouth kisses. Contact with inanimate objects like toilet seats, doorknobs, or utensils used by an HIV-positive person does not facilitate transmission. Additionally, HIV is not transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or other hematophagous insects. Non-fluid-exchanging sexual activities, such as touching, do not result in transmission. The virus cannot penetrate intact, healthy skin.","You cannot get HIV from: Air or water. Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV.

GPT-score_rephrased_true_answers_answers_category_1.5_HIV_EQ.json,rephrased_true_answers,1,5,10,What is known about the switch that occurs between patients with latent HIV and active infection?,"The transition from latent to active HIV infection is predominantly mediated by the reactivation of the HIV provirus within cells harboring latent infection. Latency is characterized by the integration of viral genetic material into the host genome, maintaining the virus in a quiescent state. During latency, viral replication and gene expression are significantly reduced or absent, and the infected cells retain normal functionality. This latent state is crucial for the chronic persistence of HIV in patients, even when systemic viral replication is controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The shift to active infection occurs when the provirus is transcriptionally reactivated, often initiated by external stimuli or events that activate the host cell. A potential mechanism for this reactivation involves the interaction of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), with the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, leading to the initiation of proviral transcription. Additional contributors to this switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition is pivotal in the disease's pathogenesis, as active infection phases facilitate viral replication and dissemination to new cells, ultimately causing the progressive deterioration of the host's immune system. Elucidating the molecular pathways governing the switch from latent to active HIV infection could aid in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating latently infected cells, which pose a significant barrier to achieving an HIV cure.","The switch between latent and active HIV infection is primarily driven by the activation of HIV provirus within latently infected cells. Latent HIV infection occurs when the virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to persist in a dormant state. In latent infection, viral replication and gene expression are minimal or absent, and the infected cells remain functionally normal. This form of infection is responsible for the long-term persistence of HIV in individuals, even when systemic viral replication is suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to active HIV infection occurs when the provirus becomes transcriptionally active; this is often triggered by extracellular signals or events that activate the host cell. One possible mechanism for the switch involves the binding of cellular transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) region, resulting in the activation of proviral transcription. Other factors that can contribute to the switch include cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activation signals. This transition between latent and active HIV infection plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it is during periods of active infection that the virus replicates and spreads to new cells, ultimately leading to the progressive decline of the host immune system. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the switch from latent to active HIV infection could help inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting and eliminating latently infected cells, which represent a major obstacle to achieving a cure for HIV.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
