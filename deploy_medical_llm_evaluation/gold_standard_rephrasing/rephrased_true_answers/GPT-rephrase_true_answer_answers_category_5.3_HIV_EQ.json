The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\",\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"Indeed, if either patient is not receiving statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, it should be included in their treatment plan. It is advisable to prescribe atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the minimal effective dosage, as these statins exhibit fewer pharmacological interactions with antiretroviral therapy. Typically, a regimen consisting of an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is recommended.\"\n}\n```"
