The patients are not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD. Should I incorporate it to the treatment regimen of both patients?\n    True answer: Yes, if any of the patients is not under statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD, incorporate it to their treatment regimen. The prescription of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the lowest effective dose is recommended, as these statins have fewer drug interactions with ART. A combination of INSTI + 2 NRTIs is generally recommended.\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your rephrased answer should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question\": \"The original question\"\n    \"true_answer\": \"The original true answer\"\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"The true answer rephrased\"\n    }\n    "

I am a clinician located in Uganda. Should I consider HIV-positive patients homosexuals?\n    True answer: No, HIV-positive patients cannot be considered homosexuals. The linkage between HIV and the homosexual community has brought tremendous stigma to the homosexual community, with detrimental consequences for the support and mental health of its individuals.
