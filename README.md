# üè• HIVMedQA: Benchmarking large language models for HIV medical decision support

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support clinicians in routine decision making. This study aims to evaluate the current state of LLMs for HIV management, examining their strengths and limitations. We developed HIVMedQA, a benchmark for evaluating open-ended medical question answering in the context of HIV patient management. We assessed seven general-purpose LLMs and three medically specialized LLMs, using prompt engineering to optimize performance.

## Overview

This study aims to evaluate the performance of current LLMs in the context of curbside consults for HIV care and provide actionable insights for their future development Specifically, we focus on:
- (1) assessing the reliability of LLMs as judges 
- (2) identifying the most effective lexical matching techniques for open-ended question evaluation
- (3) comparing the performance of small-scale versus large-scale LLMs
- (4) evaluating domain-specific (medical) models against generalized LLMs
- (5) benchmarking clinical skills of LLMs across the key dimensions comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, and harm.
